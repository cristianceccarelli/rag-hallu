What is the Phaedrus Dialogue?,"The Phaedrus Dialogue is a philosophical text written by the ancient Greek philosopher Phaedrus. It is a dialogue between Phaedrus and a companion who is called ""Socrates."" The dialogue is considered one of the most important works in the history of philosophy, and it is known for its exploration of the nature of knowledge, the role of the individual in society, and the relationship between philosophy and religion.

The Phaedrus Dialogue is set in a garden, and Phaedrus and Socrates are joined by a third person, who is called ""Hermotimus."" The dialogue is divided into two parts, and each part is divided into two books. The first part of the dialogue is called ""The Book of the Gods,"" and it deals with the nature of the gods and the role of religion in human life. The second part of the dialogue is called ""The Book of the Men,"" and it deals with the nature of human beings and their relationship to the world around them.

In the first part of the dialogue, Phaedrus and Socrates discuss the nature of the gods and their relationship to human beings. They argue that the gods are not real, but that they are merely representations of human ideas and desires. They also argue that the gods are not benevolent, but that they are cruel and capricious.

In the second part of the dialogue, Phaedrus and Socrates discuss the nature of human beings and their relationship to the world around them. They argue that human beings are not just physical objects, but that they are also spiritual beings. They also argue that human beings are capable of great good and great evil, and that their actions have consequences both in this life and in the next.

The Phaedrus Dialogue is considered one of the most important works in the history of philosophy because it explores some of the most fundamental questions about the nature of human beings and the world around them. It is also considered one of the most important works in the history of philosophy because it is written in a style that is both accessible and profound.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_(dialogue),"

The Phaedrus (/ˈfiːdrəs/; Ancient Greek: Φαῖδρος, romanized: Phaidros), written by Plato, is a dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus, an interlocutor in several dialogues. The Phaedrus was presumably composed around 370 BC, about the same time as Plato's Republic and Symposium.[1] Although ostensibly about the topic of love, the discussion in the dialogue revolves around the art of rhetoric and how it should be practiced, and dwells on subjects as diverse as metempsychosis (the Greek tradition of reincarnation) and erotic love, and the nature of the human soul shown in the famous chariot allegory.


Setting[edit]
Socrates runs into Phaedrus on the outskirts of Athens. Phaedrus has just come from the home of Epicrates of Athens, where Lysias, son of Cephalus, has given a speech on love. Socrates, stating that he is ""sick with passion for hearing speeches"",[Note 1] walks into the countryside with Phaedrus. Socrates is hoping that Phaedrus will repeat the speech. They sit by a stream under a plane tree and a chaste tree, and the rest of the dialogue consists of oration and discussion.
The dialogue does not set itself as a re-telling of the day's events. It is given in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story. This is in contrast to dialogues such as the Symposium, in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.[2]

Dramatis personae[edit]
Socrates
Phaedrus
Lysias (in absentia)
Lysias was one of the three sons of Cephalus, the patriarch whose home is the setting for Plato's Republic. Lysias was perhaps the most famous logographos (λογογράφος, lit. ""speech writer"") in Athens during the time of Plato. Lysias was a rhetorician and a sophist whose best-known extant work is a defense speech, ""On the Murder of Eratosthenes"". In the speech a man who killed his wife's lover claims that the laws of Athens required him to do it. The outcome of this speech is unknown.

Summary[edit]
The dialogue consists of a series of three speeches on the topic of love that serves as the subject to construct a discussion on the proper use of rhetoric. They encompass discussions of the soul, madness, divine inspiration, and the practice and mastery of an art.
As they walk out into the countryside, Socrates tries to convince Phaedrus to repeat the speech of Lysias which he has just heard. Phaedrus makes several excuses, but Socrates suspects strongly that Phaedrus has a copy of the speech with him. Saying that while Lysias is present, he would never allow himself to be used as a training partner for Phaedrus to practice his own speech-making on, he asks Phaedrus to expose what he is holding under his cloak. Phaedrus gives in and agrees to perform Lysias' speech.[Note 2]

Lysias' speech (230e–235e)[edit]
Phaedrus and Socrates walk through a stream and find a seat in the shade. Phaedrus and Socrates both note how anyone would consider Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to his love of learning which ""trees and open country won't teach,"" while ""men in the town"" will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading him out of his native land: ""Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for getting me out. A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please.""[Note 3]
Phaedrus then commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with ""You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out"",[Note 3] the speech proceeds to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is ""more sick than sound in the head"" and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.
Socrates, attempting to flatter Phaedrus, responds that he is in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.[Note 4]
Socrates retorts that he is still in awe, and claims to be able to make an even better speech than Lysias on the same subject.[Note 5]

First speech of Socrates (237a–241d)[edit]
When Phaedrus begs to hear it, however, Socrates refuses to give the speech. Phaedrus warns him that he is younger and stronger, and Socrates should ""take his meaning"" and ""stop playing hard to get"".[Note 6] Finally, after Phaedrus swears on the plane tree that he will never recite another speech for Socrates if Socrates refuses, Socrates, covering his head, consents.[Note 7]
Socrates, rather than simply listing reasons as Lysias had done, begins by explaining that while all men desire beauty, some are in love and some are not. We are all ruled, he says, by two principles: one is our inborn desire for pleasure, and the other is our acquired judgment that pursues what is best (237d). Following your judgment is ""being in your right mind"", while following desire towards pleasure without reason is ""outrage"" (hubris).[Note 8]
Following different desires leads to different things; one who follows his desire for food is a glutton, and so on. The desire to take pleasure in beauty, reinforced by the kindred beauty in human bodies, is called Eros.[Note 9]
Remarking that he is in the grip of something divine, and may soon be overtaken by the madness of the nymphs in this place,[Note 10] he goes on.
The problem, he explains, is that one overcome with this desire will want to turn his boy into whatever is most pleasing to himself, rather than what is best for the boy.[Note 11]  The boy's intellectual progress will be stifled, his physical condition will suffer,[Note 12] the lover will not wish the boy to mature and take a family,[Note 13] all because the lover is shaping him out of desire for pleasure rather than what is best. At some point, ""right-minded reason"" will take the place of ""the madness of love"",[Note 14] and the lover's oaths and promises to his boy will be broken.
Phaedrus believes that one of the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy's life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.
The non-lover, he concludes, will do none of this, always ruled by judgment rather than desire for pleasure. Socrates, fearing that the nymphs will take complete control of him if he continues, states that he is going to leave before Phaedrus makes him ""do something even worse"".[Note 15]
However, just before Socrates is about to leave, he is stopped by the ""familiar divine sign"", his daemon, which always occurs and only just before Socrates is about to do something he should not. A voice ""from this very spot"" forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias' repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, and seemed to be showing off. Socrates states that he is a ""seer"". While he is not very good at it, he is good enough for his purposes, and he recognizes what his offense has been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him.[Note 16] Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the Muses, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.[Note 17]

The beginning of Phaedrus in one of the most important medieval manuscripts of Plato, Codex Clarkianus 39 in the Bodleian Library, copied in AD 895.
Second speech of Socrates (244a–257b)[edit]
Madness (244a–245c)[edit]
Socrates begins by discussing madness. If madness is all bad, then the preceding speeches would have been correct, but in actuality, madness given as a gift of the gods provides us with some of the best things we have.[Note 18] There are, in fact, several kinds of divine madness (theia mania), of which he cites four examples:[3]

From Apollo, the prophetic madness;
From Dionysus, the initiatory or ritual madness;
From the Muses, the poetic madness;
From Aphrodite, erotic madness
As they must show that the madness of love is, indeed, sent by a god to benefit the lover and beloved in order to disprove the preceding speeches, Socrates embarks on a proof of the divine origin of this fourth sort of madness. It is a proof, he says, that will convince ""the wise if not the clever"".[Note 19]

The soul (245c–249d)[edit]
He begins by briefly proving the immortality of the soul. A soul is always in motion and as a self-mover has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source of everything else that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary.[Note 20]
Then begins the famous chariot allegory. A soul, says Socrates, is like the ""natural union of a team of winged horses and their charioteer"". While the gods have two good horses, everyone else has a mixture: one is beautiful and good, while the other is neither.[Note 21]
As souls are immortal, those lacking bodies patrol all of heaven so long as their wings are in perfect condition. When a soul sheds its wings, it comes to earth and takes on an earthly body that then seems to move itself.[Note 22] These wings lift up heavy things to where the gods dwell and are nourished and grow in the presence of the wisdom, goodness, and beauty of the divine. However, foulness and ugliness make the wings shrink and disappear.[Note 23]
In heaven, he explains, there is a procession led by Zeus, who looks after everything and puts things in order. All the gods, except for Hestia, follow Zeus in this procession. While the chariots of the gods are balanced and easier to control, other charioteers must struggle with their bad horse, which will drag them down to earth if it has not been properly trained.[Note 24]  As the procession works its way upward, it eventually makes it up to the high ridge of heaven where the gods take their stands and are taken in a circular motion to gaze at all that is beyond heaven.[Note 25]
What is outside of heaven, says Socrates, is quite difficult to describe, lacking color, shape, or solidity, as it is the subject of all true knowledge, visible only to intelligence.[Note 26]  The gods delight in these things and are nourished. Feeling wonderful, they are taken around until they make a complete circle. On the way they are able to see Justice, Self-control, Knowledge, and other things as they are in themselves, unchanging. When they have seen all things and feasted on them, coming all the way around, they sink back down inside heaven.[Note 27]
The immortal souls that follow the gods most closely are able to just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, having to deal with their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while straining to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers and artists have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.[Note 28]
Souls then begin cycles of reincarnation. It generally takes 10,000 years for a soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life three times in a row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.[Note 29]

The madness of love (249d–257b)[edit]
One comes to manifest this sort of love after seeing beauty here on earth and being reminded of true beauty as it was seen beyond heaven. When reminded, the wings begin to grow back, but as they are not yet able to rise, the afflicted gaze aloft and pay no attention to what goes on below, bringing on the charge of madness. This is the best form that possession by a god can take, for all those connected to it.[Note 30]
When one is reminded of true beauty by the sight of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that can remember are startled when they see a reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.[Note 31]
Beauty, he states, was among the most radiant things to see beyond heaven, and on earth it sparkles through vision, the clearest of our senses. Some have not been recently initiated, and mistake this reminder for beauty itself and only pursue desires of the flesh. This pursuit of pleasure, then, even when manifested in the love of beautiful bodies, is not ""divine"" madness, but rather just having lost one's head. The recent initiates, on the other hand, are overcome when they see a bodily form that has captured true beauty well, and their wings begin to grow. When this soul looks upon the beautiful boy it experiences the utmost joy; when separated from the boy, intense pain and longing occur, and the wings begin to harden. Caught between these two feelings, the lover is in utmost anguish, with the boy the only doctor for the pain.[Note 32]
Socrates then returns to the myth of the chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is controlled by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can to go up to the boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.[Note 33]
The lover now pursues the boy. As he gets closer to his quarry, and the love is reciprocated, the opportunity for sexual contact again presents itself. If the lover and beloved surpass this desire they have won the ""true Olympic Contests""; it is the perfect combination of human self-control and divine madness, and after death, their souls return to heaven.[Note 34] Those who give in do not become weightless, but they are spared any punishment after their death, and will eventually grow wings together when the time comes.[Note 35]
A lover's friendship is divine, Socrates concludes, while that of a non-lover offers only cheap, human dividends, and tosses the soul about on earth for 9,000 years. He apologizes to the gods for the previous speeches, and Phaedrus joins him in the prayer.[Note 36]

Fragments of a papyrus roll of the Phaedrus from the 2nd century AD
After Phaedrus concedes that this speech was certainly better than any Lysias could compose, they begin a discussion of the nature and uses of rhetoric itself. After showing that speech making itself isn't something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks what distinguishes good from bad writing, and they take this up.[Note 37]
Phaedrus claims that to be a good speechmaker, one does not need to know the truth of what he is speaking on, but rather how to properly persuade,[Note 38] persuasion being the purpose of speechmaking and oration. Socrates first objects that an orator who does not know bad from good will, in Phaedrus's words, harvest ""a crop of really poor quality"". Yet Socrates does not dismiss the art of speechmaking. Rather, he says, it may be that even one who knew the truth could not produce conviction without knowing the art of persuasion;[Note 39] on the other hand, ""As the Spartan said, there is no genuine art of speaking without a grasp of the truth, and there never will be"".[Note 40]
To acquire the art of rhetoric, then, one must make systematic divisions between two different kinds of things: one sort, like ""iron"" and ""silver"", suggests the same to all listeners; the other sort, such as ""good"" or ""justice"", lead people in different directions.[Note 41] Lysias failed to make this distinction, and accordingly, failed to even define what ""love"" itself is in the beginning; the rest of his speech appears thrown together at random, and is, on the whole, very poorly constructed.[Note 42] Socrates then goes on to say,

""Every speech must be put together like a living creature, with a body of its own; it must be neither without head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and extremities that are fitting both to one another and to the whole work.""[Note 43]
Socrates's speech, on the other hand, starts with a thesis and proceeds to make divisions accordingly, finding divine love, and setting it out as the greatest of goods. And yet, they agree, the art of making these divisions is dialectic, not rhetoric, and it must be seen what part of rhetoric may have been left out.[Note 44]
When Socrates and Phaedrus proceed to recount the various tools of speechmaking as written down by the great orators of the past, starting with the ""Preamble"" and the ""Statement Facts"" and concluding with the ""Recapitulation"", Socrates states that the fabric seems a little threadbare.[Note 45] He goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor who knows how to raise and lower a body's temperature but does not know when it is good or bad to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or come across some potions knows nothing of the art.[Note 46] One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing tragedies; if one were to claim to have mastered harmony after learning the lowest and highest notes on the lyre, a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, but it is not the knowledge of harmony itself.[Note 47] This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through ""Preambles"" and ""Recapitulations""; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only what is necessary to learn as preliminaries.[Note 48]
They go on to discuss what is good or bad in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, critically commenting on the gift of writing from the Egyptian god Theuth to King Thamus, who was to disperse Theuth's gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.[Note 49]
No written instructions for an art can yield results clear or certain, Socrates states, but rather can only remind those that already know what writing is about.[Note 50]  Furthermore, writings are silent; they cannot speak, answer questions, or come to their own defense.[Note 51]
Accordingly, the legitimate sister of this is, in fact, dialectic; it is the living, breathing discourse of one who knows, of which the written word can only be called an image.[Note 52] The one who knows uses the art of dialectic rather than writing:

""The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge—discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it happy as any human being can be.""[Note 53]
Interpretations and themes[edit]
Chariot allegory[edit]
Plato paints the picture of a charioteer driving a chariot pulled by two winged horses:
""First the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character. Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome.""[4]
The charioteer represents intellect, reason, or the part of the soul that must guide the soul to truth; one horse represents rational or moral impulse or the positive part of passionate nature (e.g., righteous indignation); while the other represents the soul's irrational passions, appetites, or concupiscent nature. The charioteer directs the entire chariot/soul, trying to stop the horses from going different ways, and to proceed towards enlightenment.
Plato describes a ""great circuit"" which souls make as they follow the gods in the path of enlightenment. Those few souls which are fully enlightened are able to see the world of the forms in all its glory. Some souls have difficulty controlling the black horse, even with the help of the white horse. They may bob up into the world of the forms, but at other times enlightenment is hidden from them. If overcome by the black horse or forgetfulness, the soul loses its wings and is pulled down to earth.
Should that happen, the soul is incarnated into one of nine kinds of person, according to how much truth it beheld. In order of decreasing levels of truth seen, the categories are: (1) philosophers, lovers of beauty, or someone musical and erotic; (2) law-abiding kings or civic leaders; (3) politicians, estate-managers or businessmen; (4) ones who specialize in bodily health; (5) prophets or mystery cult participants; (6) poets or imitative artists; (7) craftsmen or farmers; (8) sophists or demagogues; and (9) tyrants.[5]
One need not suppose that Plato intended this as a literal discussion of metempsychosis or reincarnation: perhaps he meant it figuratively.[6]
Plato does not see the human soul as a sort of patchwork of emotions and concepts; this differs from the views of many philosophers of his time. Instead he views the soul as a sort of composite, in which many different elements blend together and affect each other. He uses the allegory of the charioteer to explain that love is a reflection of love of the forms, and is thus a ""divine madness,"" a theia mania.

Madness and divine inspiration[edit]
In the Phaedrus, Socrates makes the rather bold claim that some of life's greatest blessings flow from madness; and he clarifies this later by noting that he is referring specifically to madness inspired by the gods. Phaedrus is Plato's only dialogue that shows Socrates outside the city of Athens, out in the country. It was believed that spirits and nymphs inhabited the country, and Socrates specifically points this out after the long palinode with his comment about listening to the cicadas. After originally remarking that ""landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me, only people do"",[Note 54] Socrates goes on to make constant remarks concerning the presence and action of the gods in general, nature gods such as Pan and the nymphs, and the Muses, in addition to the unusually explicit characterization of his own daemon. The importance of divine inspiration is demonstrated in its connection with the importance of religion, poetry and art, and above all else, love. Eros, much like in the Symposium, is contrasted from mere desire of the pleasurable and given a higher, heavenly function. Unlike in the Ion, a dialogue dealing with madness and divine inspiration in poetry and literary criticism, madness here must go firmly hand in hand with reason, learning, and self-control in both love and art. This rather bold claim has puzzled readers and scholars of Plato's work for centuries because it clearly shows that Socrates saw genuine value in the irrational elements of human life, despite many other dialogues that show him arguing that one should pursue beauty and that wisdom is the most beautiful thing of all.

Pederasty[edit]
The pederastic relationships common to ancient Greek life are also at the fore of this dialogue.  In addition to theme of love discussed in the speeches, seeming double entendres and sexual innuendo are abundant; we see the flirtation between Phaedrus and Socrates. As Phaedrus encourages Socrates to make his first speech, Phaedrus makes a remark at noon-time that Socrates should not leave as the heat has not passed and it is ""straight-up, as they say,"" Socrates wishes to know what Phaedrus is holding under his cloak, and so on.  The relationships discussed in the speeches are explicitly pederastic.  And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, as they are in the Symposium.  Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as ""friends"": equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty.  In the beginning, they sit themselves under a chaste tree, which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as ""monk's pepper"", it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an antaphrodisiac.  Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.

Rhetoric, philosophy, and art[edit]
The Phaedrus also gives us much in the way of explaining how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a ""midwife of the soul"" in the Theaetetus; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is for and what it can help one achieve.
The role of divine inspiration in philosophy must also be considered; the philosopher is struck with the fourth kind of madness, that of love, and it is this divine inspiration that leads him and his beloved towards the good—but only when tempered with self-control.
Writing, examined separately but ultimately equated with philosophy and rhetoric, is somewhat deprecated; it is stated that writing can do little but remind those who already know. Unlike dialectic and rhetoric, writing cannot be tailored to specific situations or students; the writer does not have the luxury of examining his reader's soul in order to determine the proper way to persuade. When attacked it cannot defend itself, and is unable to answer questions or refute criticism. As such, the philosopher uses writing ""for the sake of amusing himself"" and other similar things rather than for teaching others. A writer, then, is only a philosopher when he can himself argue that his writing is of little worth, among other requirements.
This final critique of writing with which the dialogue concludes seems to be one of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.
There is an echo of this point of view in the Seventh Letter, wherein Plato (or the pseudo-Platonic author) says not to write down things of importance. [Note 55]

Soul: soul-leading; life as self-motion; self-motion and intelligence[edit]
Jessica Moss has argued that the entire unity of the Phaedrus is assured by the motif of soul-leading.[7] The discussion of rhetoric, for instance, features the orator leading the soul to some decision or course of action. Socrates' great myth illustrates this motif most clearly when the soul is depicted as a charioteer and its horses, being led around a heavenly circuit. This is the occasion for the first appearance in Plato's dialogues of the prominent Platonic doctrine that life is motion: the soul, being the principle (or source) of life, is that which moves itself, as opposed to inanimate objects that require an external source of motion to move them.[8] The view that life is self-motion and that the soul is a self-mover is used by Plato to guarantee the immortality of the soul, making this a novel argument for the soul's immortality not found in the Phaedo.[9] Plato relies, further, on the view that the soul is a mind in order to explain how its motions are possible: Plato combines the view that the soul is a self-mover with the view that the soul is a mind in order to explain how the soul can move things in the first place (e.g., how it can move the body to which it is attached in life).[10] Souls move things by means of their thoughts.[11]

In Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice, the narrator's young love Tadzio is associated with Phaedrus.
In Mary Renault's 1953 novel The Charioteer, a text of Phaedrus is passed among the characters (gay men during World War II) and the image of the charioteer and his white and black horses recurs as the protagonist struggles to choose between consummated and unconsummated love.
In a key scene from the film adaptation of Maurice, students, including Maurice, attend Dean Cornwallis's translation class in which two undergraduates orally translate into English the text (based on) Phaedrus (Stephanus 251a, 255a–e), during which the Dean instructs one to ""Omit the reference to the unspeakable vice of the Greeks"".
The 2016 film, Knight of Cups by Terrence Malick is inspired, in part, by Phaedrus.
In Robert M. Pirsig's fictionalized autobiographical novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Pirsig refers to his past self from before undergoing electroconvulsive therapy in the third person and using the name ""Phaedrus,"" intended to reflect his opposition to certain educational and philosophical ideas.

"
What is the Strait of Gibraltar?,"The Strait of Gibraltar is a narrow passage between Spain and Morocco, located in the western Mediterranean Sea. It is a strategic location for trade and transportation, as it connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Mediterranean Sea.

Some specific details and examples of the Strait of Gibraltar include:

1. The Strait of Gibraltar has a width of approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) at its narrowest point.
2. The strait is located between the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) and the African continent (Morocco).
3. The Strait of Gibraltar is a popular route for shipping, as it allows vessels to pass from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea in a shorter distance than through other routes.
4. The Strait of Gibraltar is also a popular tourist destination, with many beaches and resorts located along its shores.
5. The strait has been the site of several naval battles throughout history, including the Battle of Gibraltar in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War.
6. The Strait of Gibraltar is also a popular location for bird watching, as it is home to many migratory bird species.
7. The Strait of Gibraltar is a natural barrier, as it separates the Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea. This has led to the development of unique ecosystems on either side of the strait, including the Gibraltar Rock, a natural formation located in the Atlantic Ocean.
8. The Strait of Gibraltar is also a popular location for fishing, as it is home to many species of fish, including tuna, sardines, and mackerel.
9. The Strait of Gibraltar is also a popular location for scuba diving, as it is home to many underwater caves and shipwrecks.
10. The Strait of Gibraltar is a natural gateway for trade, as it connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Mediterranean Sea. This has led to the development of trade routes between Europe and Africa, and has been a major factor in the history and culture of the region.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar,"

Strait connecting the Atlantic to the Mediterranean
Not to be confused with Gibraltar.


Strait of Gibraltar
مضيق جبل طارق (Arabic)
Strait of Gibraltar (English)
Estrecho de Gibraltar (Spanish)
The Strait of Gibraltar as seen from space. The Iberian Peninsula is on the left and North Africa is on the right.Strait of GibraltarLocation of the Strait of Gibraltar between Africa (centre right) and Europe (top right), connecting the Atlantic Ocean in the centre to the Mediterranean Sea on the rightLocationAtlantic Ocean – Mediterranean SeaCoordinates35°57′N 5°30′W﻿ / ﻿35.950°N 5.500°W﻿ / 35.950; -5.500TypeStraitBasin countriesUnited Kingdom (Gibraltar)MoroccoSpainMin. width14.2 km (8.8 mi)Max. depth900 m (2,953 ft)
The Strait of Gibraltar[1] is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Europe from Africa.
The two continents are separated by 7.7 nautical miles (14.2 kilometers, 8.9 miles) at its narrowest point.[2] Ferries cross between the two continents every day in as little as 35 minutes. The Strait's depth ranges between 300 and 900 metres (980 and 2,950 feet; 160 and 490 fathoms).[3]
The strait lies in the territorial waters of Morocco, Spain, and the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, foreign vessels and aircraft have the freedom of navigation and overflight to cross the strait of Gibraltar in case of continuous transit.


Names and etymology[edit]
The name comes from the Rock of Gibraltar, which in turn originates from the Arabic Jabal Ṭāriq (meaning ""Tariq's Mount""),[4] named after Tariq ibn Ziyad. It is also known as the Straits of Gibraltar, the Gut of Gibraltar (although this is mostly archaic),[5] the STROG (STRait Of Gibraltar) in naval use.[6]
Another Arabic name is Bāb al-maghrib (Arabic: باب المغرب), meaning ""Gate of the West"" or ""Gate of the sunset"", and furthermore ""Gate of the Maghreb"" or ""Gate of Morocco[broken anchor]"".[citation needed] In the Middle Ages it was called in Arabic Az-Zuqāq (الزقاق 'the Passage'), or bḥar az-zuqāq (بحر الزقاق 'the passage sea') and by the Romans Fretum Gaditanum (Strait of Cadiz).[7]
In Latin it has been called Fretum Herculeum,[8] based on the name from antiquity ""Pillars of Hercules"" (Ancient Greek: αἱ Ἡράκλειοι στῆλαι, romanized: hai Hērákleioi stêlai),[9] referring to the mountains as pillars, such as Gibraltar, flanking the strait.

Location[edit]
Europe (left) and Africa (right)
On the northern side of the Strait are Spain and Gibraltar (a British overseas territory in the Iberian Peninsula). On the southern side are Morocco and Ceuta (a Spanish autonomous city in northern Africa).
Due to its location, the Strait is commonly used for illegal immigration from Africa to Europe.[10]

Extent[edit]
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Strait of Gibraltar as follows:[11]


On the West. A line joining Cape Trafalgar to Cape Spartel.
On the East. A line joining Europa Point to the Peninsula of Almina.


Geology[edit]
A view across the Strait of Gibraltar taken from the hills above Tarifa, Spain
The seabed of the Strait is composed of synorogenic Betic-Rif clayey flysch covered by Pliocene and/or Quaternary calcareous sediments, sourced from thriving cold water coral communities.[12] Exposed bedrock surfaces, coarse sediments and local sand dunes attest to the strong bottom current conditions at the present time.[citation needed]
Around 5.9 million years ago, the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean along the Betic and Rifan Corridor was progressively restricted until its total closure, effectively causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to rise periodically within the gypsum and salt deposition range, during what is known as the Messinian salinity crisis. In this water chemistry environment, dissolved mineral concentrations, temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to precipitate many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.[citation needed]
It is estimated that, were the Strait closed even at today's higher sea level, most water in the Mediterranean basin would evaporate within a thousand years, as it is believed to have done then, and such an event would lay down mineral deposits like the salt deposits now found under the sea floor all over the Mediterranean.[citation needed]
After a lengthy period of restricted intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33 million years ago,[13] the Atlantic–Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the Zanclean flood, and has remained open ever since.[14] The erosion produced by the incoming waters seems to be the main cause for the present depth of the Strait (900 m (3,000 ft; 490 fathoms) at the narrows, 280 m (920 ft; 150 fathoms) at the Camarinal Sill). The Strait is expected to close again as the African Plate moves northward relative to the Eurasian Plate,[15] but on geological rather than human timescales.

Biodiversity[edit]
The Strait has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of the hundreds of thousands of seabirds which use it every year to migrate between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, including significant numbers of Scopoli's and Balearic shearwaters, Audouin's and lesser black-backed gulls, razorbills, and Atlantic puffins.[16]
A resident orca pod of some 36 individuals lives around the Strait, one of the few that are left in Western European waters. The pod may be facing extinction in the coming decades due to long term effects of PCB pollution.[17]

History[edit]
Main articles: History of Gibraltar, History of Spain, and History of Morocco
Historic map of the Strait of Gibraltar by Piri Reis
Evidence of the first human habitation of the area by Neanderthals dates back to 125,000 years ago. It is believed that the Rock of Gibraltar may have been one of the last outposts of Neanderthal habitation in the world, with evidence of their presence there dating to as recently as 24,000 years ago.[18] Archaeological evidence of Homo sapiens habitation of the area dates back c. 40,000 years.
The relatively short distance between the two shores has served as a quick crossing point for various groups and civilizations throughout history, including Carthaginians campaigning against Rome, Romans travelling between the provinces of Hispania and Mauritania, Vandals raiding south from Germania through Western Rome and into North Africa in the 5th century, Moors and Berbers in the 8th–11th centuries, and Spain and Portugal in the 16th century.
Beginning in 1492, the Strait began to play a certain cultural role in acting as a barrier against cross-channel conquest and the flow of culture and language that would naturally follow such a conquest. In that year, the last Muslim government north of the Strait was overthrown by a Spanish force. Since that time, the Strait has come to foster the development of two very distinct and varied cultures on either side of it after sharing much the same culture for over 500 years from the 8th century to the early 13th century.[citation needed]
On the northern side, Christian-European culture has remained dominant since the expulsion of the last Muslim kingdom in 1492, along with the Romance Spanish language, while on the southern side, Muslim-Arabic/Mediterranean has been dominant since the spread of Islam into North Africa in the 700s, along with the Arabic language.
The small British enclave of the city of Gibraltar presents a third cultural group found in the Strait. This enclave was ceded in perpetuity to Britain in the Peace of Utrecht. Gibraltar has since been used by the United Kingdom to act as a surety for control of the sea lanes into and out of the Mediterranean.
Following the Spanish coup of July 1936 the Spanish Republican Navy tried to blockade the Strait of Gibraltar to hamper the transport of Army of Africa troops from Spanish Morocco to Peninsular Spain. On 5 August 1936 the so-called Convoy de la Victoria was able to bring at least 2,500 men across the Strait, breaking the republican blockade.[19]

Communications[edit]

The Strait is an important shipping route from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Ferries operate between Spain and Morocco across the Strait, as well as between Spain and Ceuta and Gibraltar to Tangier.

Tunnel across the Strait[edit]
Discussion between Spain and Morocco of a tunnel under the strait began in the 1980s. In December 2003, both countries agreed to explore the construction of an undersea rail tunnel to connect their rail systems across the Strait. The gauge of the rail would be 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) to match the proposed construction and conversion of significant parts of the existing broad gauge system to standard gauge.[20] While the project remained in a planning phase, Spanish and Moroccan officials met to discuss it occasionally, including in 2012.[21] Those talks led to nothing constructive happening, but in April 2021 ministers from both countries agreed to a joint intergovernmental meeting to be held in Casablanca in the coming months. This was in order to resume discussions on a tunnel.[22][23] Earlier, in January 2021, the UK government had studied plans for a tunnel to link Gibraltar with Tangiers that would replace the Spanish-Moroccan project that until then had had no tangible results after over 40 years of discussions.[24]

Special flow and wave patterns[edit]
The Strait of Gibraltar links the Atlantic Ocean directly to the Mediterranean Sea. This direct linkage creates certain unique flow and wave patterns. These unique patterns are created due to the interaction of various regional and global evaporative forces, water temperatures, tidal forces, and wind forces.

Inflow and outflow[edit]
The Strait of Gibraltar with the Mediterranean Sea in upper right. Internal waves (marked with arrows) are caused by water flowing through the Strait (bottom left, top right).
Water flows through the Strait more or less continuously, both eastwards and westwards. A smaller amount of deeper, saltier and therefore denser waters continually flow westwards (the Mediterranean outflow), while a larger amount of surface waters with lower salinity and density continually flow eastwards (the Mediterranean inflow). These general flow tendencies may be occasionally interrupted for brief periods by temporary tidal flows, depending on various lunar and solar alignments. The balance of the water flow is eastwards, since the evaporation rate within the Mediterranean basin is higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it, plus the total precipitation of rain or snow that falls on it.[25] At the Strait's far western end is the Camarinal Sill, the Strait's shallowest point which limits mixing between the cold, less saline Atlantic water and the warmer, more saline Mediterranean waters.
The Mediterranean waters are so much saltier than the Atlantic waters that they sink below the constantly incoming water and form a highly saline (thermohaline, both warm and salty) layer of bottom water. This layer of bottom-water constantly works its way out into the Atlantic as the Mediterranean outflow. On the Atlantic side of the Strait, a density boundary separates the Mediterranean outflow waters from the rest at about 100 m (330 ft; 55 fathoms) depth. These waters flow out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until they begin to mix and equilibrate more rapidly, much farther out at a depth of about 1,000 m (3,300 ft; 550 fathoms). The Mediterranean outflow water layer can be traced for thousands of kilometres west of the Strait, before completely losing its identity.

Simplifed and stylized diagram of currents at the Camarinal Sill
During the Second World War, German U-boats used the currents to pass into the Mediterranean Sea without detection, by maintaining silence with engines off.[26] From September 1941 to May 1944 Germany managed to send 62 U-boats into the Mediterranean. All these boats had to navigate the British-controlled Strait of Gibraltar where nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and 10 more had to break off their run due to damage.[27]

Internal waves[edit]
Internal waves (waves at the density boundary layer) are often produced by the Strait. Like traffic merging on a highway, the water flow is constricted in both directions because it must pass over the Camarinal Sill. When large tidal flows enter the Strait and the high tide relaxes, internal waves are generated at the Camarinal Sill and proceed eastwards. Even though the waves may occur down to great depths, occasionally the waves are almost imperceptible at the surface, at other times they can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. These internal waves continue to flow eastward and to refract around coastal features. They can sometimes be traced for as much as 100 km (62 mi; 54 nmi), and sometimes create interference patterns with refracted waves.[28]

Territorial waters[edit]
See also: Status of Gibraltar § Territorial waters
Except for its far eastern end, the Strait lies within the territorial waters of Spain and Morocco. The United Kingdom claims 3 nautical miles (5.6 km; 3.5 mi) around Gibraltar on the northern side of the Strait, putting part of it inside British territorial waters. As this is less than the 12 nautical miles (22 km; 14 mi) maximum, it means, according to the British claim, that part of the Strait lies in international waters. The ownership of Gibraltar and its territorial waters is disputed by Spain. Similarly, Morocco disputes Spanish sovereignty over Ceuta on the southern coast.[29] There are several islets, such as the disputed Isla Perejil, that are claimed by both Morocco and Spain.[30]
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, vessels passing through the strait do so under the regime of transit passage, rather than the more limited innocent passage allowed in most territorial waters. Therefore, a vessel or aircraft has the freedom of navigation or overflight for the purpose of crossing the strait of Gibraltar.[29][31]

Power generation[edit]
Some studies have proposed the possibility of erecting tidal power generating stations within the Strait, to be powered from the predictable current at the Strait.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the Atlantropa project proposed damming the Strait to generate large amounts of electricity and lower the sea level of the Mediterranean by several hundreds of meters to create large new lands for settlement.[32] This proposal would however have devastating effects on the local climate and ecology [citation needed] and would dramatically change the strength of the West African Monsoon.[citation needed]

History of Strait crossings[edit]
Some adventurers crossed the Strait of Gibraltar by swimming, powered paragliding and Paddleboarding.  

By swimming[edit]
Mercedes Gleitze was the first known person to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar on 6 April 1928. It took her 12 hours and 50 minutes to cross the stretch of water. This was her sixth attempt to swim the Strait of Gibraltar, her first having been made in December 1927.
[33]

By powered paraglider[edit]
Francesco Stipo was the first known person to cross the Strait of Gibraltar with a powered paraglider on 11 July 1995.
According to Spanish newspaper Europa Sur, Stipo crossed the Strait from Tarifa to Ceuta in less than one hour, followed by the Red Cross boat ""Salvamar Tarifa"", and landed on a street near the Port of Ceuta. [34]

By stand up paddleboard[edit]
Chris Ziaja and Nik Benner were the first known people to cross the Strait of Gibraltar with a stand up paddleboard on 4 October 2010. They set out from Punta Carnero and reached Ceuta four and a half hours later.

"
What is the Pepsi Challenge?,"The Pepsi Challenge is a marketing experiment conducted by PepsiCo in 1975. The experiment involved serving two different cola drinks to a group of customers, one was Pepsi, and the other was a new brand called ""Lipton's Lemon Squash"". The customers were asked to taste the two drinks and then rate them on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.

The experiment was conducted in a blind test, meaning the customers did not know which drink was which. The results showed that the majority of the customers preferred the Pepsi drink over the Lipton's Lemon Squash drink. This experiment helped PepsiCo to launch the Pepsi-Cola brand in the UK and other European countries.

The Pepsi Challenge was a significant event in the marketing industry as it showed the power of branding and the impact of consumer perception on a product's success. The experiment also highlighted the importance of consumer research and testing before launching a new product.

The Pepsi Challenge was conducted by PepsiCo and was not a scientific experiment, but it was a marketing experiment that involved a blind test and the results showed that the majority of the customers preferred the Pepsi drink over the Lipton's Lemon Squash drink.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Challenge,"

Marketing campaign, originally versus Coke taste test
The Pepsi Challenge is an ongoing marketing promotion run by PepsiCo since 1975. It is also the name of a cross country ski race at Giant's Ridge Ski Area in Biwabik, Minnesota, an event sponsored by Pepsi.[1]


Method[edit]
An early 1980s ""Pepsi Challenge"" 12 oz. (355 ml.) promotional can, and a metal tab button publicizing the challenge.
The challenge originally took the form of a single blind taste test. At malls, shopping centers, and other public locations, a Pepsi representative sets up a table with two white cups: one containing Pepsi and one with Coca-Cola.[2] Shoppers are encouraged to taste both colas and then select which drink they prefer. Then the representative reveals the two bottles so the taster can see whether they preferred Coke or Pepsi.  The results of the test leaned toward a consensus that Pepsi was preferred by more Americans.[3] The Pepsi Challenge has been featured in much of Pepsi's TV advertising.[4]

History[edit]
The challenge launched in 1975, as part of the ongoing Cola wars between Pepsi and The Coca-Cola Company.[5] A Coca-Cola pinback button, ""I picked Coke in the Pepsi Challenge.""
In his book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (2005), author Malcolm Gladwell presents evidence that suggests Pepsi's success over Coca-Cola in the ""Pepsi Challenge"" is a result of the flawed nature of the ""sip test"" method.[6] His research shows that tasters will generally prefer the sweeter of two beverages based on a single sip, even if they prefer a less sweet beverage over the course of an entire can.[7] Additionally, the challenge more often than not labeled the Pepsi cup with an ""M"" and the Coca-Cola cup with a ""Q,"" suggesting letter preference may drive some of the results.[8] Donald M. Kendall of Pepsi promoted the Pepsi Challenge. 
When the preference in blind tests is compared to tests wherein cups are labeled with arbitrary labels (e.g., S or L) or brand names, the ratings of preference change.[9] Scientific findings do support a perceptible difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but not between Pepsi and RC Cola.[10]
In his book Bad Habits, humorist Dave Barry describes the Pepsi challenge as, ""Pepsi’s ongoing misguided attempt to convince the general public that Coke and Pepsi are not the same thing, which of course they are.""[11]
In 2015, Pepsi relaunched the Pepsi Challenge on social media.[12] As part of this year long promotion, Pepsi signed various celebrity ambassadors to advertise their product on their social media accounts under the hashtag #PepsiChallenge.[13]

Contest[edit]
In 1981, Pepsi ran a ""Pepsi Challenge Payoff"" contest that would hand out a large prize to anyone who could gather Pepsi bottle caps that spelled out the word “Challenge"".[14]

"
What is the Legal Realism movement?,"The Legal Realism movement was a legal philosophy that emerged in the United States during the early 20th century. It was a reaction against the prevailing legal theories of the time, which were largely based on the principles of natural law and the idea that judges should interpret the law in a way that is consistent with the intentions of the creators of the legal system.

Legal Realists believed that the law should be viewed as a social and political construct, rather than as an objective and immutable body of rules. They argued that judges should consider the social and political context in which the law is used, and that the law should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the interests and values of the people who are affected by it.

Some of the key figures associated with the Legal Realism movement include Louis Brandeis, who was a Supreme Court Justice during the early 20th century, and Thurgood Marshall, who was a prominent civil rights lawyer and later the first Black Supreme Court Justice.

One of the key events associated with the Legal Realism movement was the case of United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, which was decided by the Supreme Court in 1938. In this case, the Court held that judges should consider the social and political context in which the law is used, and that the law should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the interests and values of the people who are affected by it.

Another key event was the publication of the book ""The Federalist Papers"" in 1961, which was a collection of essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in the late 18th century. The book argued that the Constitution was a living document, and that it should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the interests and values of the people who are affected by it.

Overall, the Legal Realism movement was a significant influence on the development of American legal theory, and it continues to be studied and debated by legal scholars today.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_realism,"

Legal realism is a naturalistic approach to law; it is the view that jurisprudence should emulate the methods of natural science; that is, it should rely on empirical evidence. Hypotheses must be tested against observations of the world.[citation needed]
Legal realists believe that legal science should only investigate law with the value-free methods of natural sciences, rather than through philosophical inquiries into the nature and meaning of the law that are separate and distinct from the law as it is actually practiced. Indeed, legal realism asserts that the law cannot be separated from its application, nor can it be understood outside of its application. As such, legal realism emphasizes law as it actually exists, rather than law as it ought to be. Locating the meaning of law in places such as legal opinions issued by judges and their deference to or dismissal of precedent and the doctrine of stare decisis, it stresses the importance of understanding the factors involved in judicial decision-making. 
In Scandinavia Axel Hägerström developed another realist tradition that was influential in European jurisprudential circles for most of the 20th century.[1]

Legal realism is associated with American jurisprudence during the 1920s and 1930s, particularly among federal judges[2] and lawyers within the Roosevelt administration. Notable jurists associated with legal realism include Felix Cohen, Morris Cohen, Arthur Corbin, Walter Wheeler Cook, Robert Hale, Wesley Hohfeld, Karl Llewellyn, Underhill Moore, Herman Oliphant and Warren Seavey,[2] many of whom were associated with Yale Law School. As Keith Bybee argues, ""legal realism exposed the role played by politics in judicial decision-making and, in doing so, called into question conventional efforts to anchor judicial power on a fixed, impartial foundation.""[3] Contemporary legal scholars working within the Law and Society tradition have expanded upon the foundations set by legal realism to postulate what has been referred to as new legal realism.
As a form of jurisprudence, legal realism is defined by its focus on the law as it actually exists in practice, rather than how it exists in books. To this end, it was primarily concerned with the actions of judges and the factors that influenced processes of judicial decision making. As Karl Llewellyn argues, “[b]ehind decisions stand judges; judges are men; as men they have human backgrounds.”[4] The law, therefore, did not exist in a metaphysical realm of fundamental rules or principles, but was inseparable from human action and the power of judges to determine the law. In order to understand the decisions and actions of legal actors, legal realists turned to the ideas of the social sciences in order to understand the human behavior and relationships that culminated in a given legal outcome.[5]
American legal realists believe that there is more to adjudication than the ""mechanical"" application of known legal principles to uncontroversial fact-finding in line with the arguments of legal formalism. Some realists believe that one can never be sure that the facts and law identified in the judge's reasons were the actual reasons for the judgment, whereas other realists accept that a judge's reasons can often be relied upon, but not always. Realists believe that the legal principles that legal formalism treats as uncontroversial actually hide contentious political and moral choices.
Due to their value-free approach, legal realists oppose natural law traditions. Legal realists contend that these traditions are historical and social phenomena and should be explained by psychological and sociological hypotheses, conceiving of legal phenomena as determined by human behavior that should be investigated empirically, rather than according to theoretical assumptions about the law. 
Realism was treated as a conceptual claim for much of the late 20th century due to H. L. A. Hart's misunderstanding of the theory.[6] Hart was an analytical legal philosopher who was interested in the conceptual analysis of concepts such as ""law."" This entailed identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept of ""law."" When realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. pointed out that individuals embroiled in the legal system generally wanted to know what was going to happen, Hart assumed that they were offering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept of ""law."" Legal theorists tend to recognize that the realists and the conceptual lawyers were interested in different questions. Realists are interested in methods of predicting judges' decisions with more accuracy, whereas conceptual lawyers are interested in the correct use of legal concepts.
Legal realism was primarily a reaction to the legal formalism of the late 19th century and early 20th century and was the dominant approach for much of the early 20th century. It succeeded in its negative aspiration of casting doubt upon formalist assumptions that judges always did what they said, so that it is often said that ""we are all realists now."" However, realism failed in its positive aspiration of discovering a better way of predicting how judges would behave than relying on the reasons given by judges.
A theory of law and legal reasoning that arose in the early decades of the twentieth century is broadly characterized by the claim that law can be best understood by focusing on what judges actually do in deciding cases, rather than on what they say they are doing.[7] The central target of legal realism was legal formalism: the classical view that judges don't make law, but mechanically apply it by logically deducing uniquely correct legal conclusions from a set of clear, consistent, and comprehensive legal rules. American legal realism has aptly been described as ""the most important indigenous jurisprudential movement in the United States during the twentieth century"".[8]

Forerunners[edit]
Although the American legal realist movement first emerged as a cohesive intellectual force in the 1920s, it drew heavily upon a number of prior thinkers and was influenced by broader cultural forces. In the early years of the twentieth century, formalist approaches to the law had been forcefully criticized by thinkers such as Roscoe Pound, John Chipman Gray, and Benjamin Cardozo. Philosophers such as John Dewey had held up empirical science as a model of all intelligent inquiry, and argued that law should be seen as a practical instrument for advancing human welfare. Outside the realm of law, in fields such as economics and history, there was a general ""revolt against formalism,"" a reaction in favor of more empirical ways of doing philosophy and the human sciences.[9] But by far the most important intellectual influence on the legal realists was the thought of the American jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[edit]
Holmes is a towering figure in American legal thought for many reasons, but what the realists drew most from Holmes was his famous prediction theory of law, his utilitarian approach to legal reasoning, and his ""realist"" insistence that judges, in deciding cases, are not deducing legal conclusions with inexorable, machine-like logic, but are influenced by ideas of fairness, public policy, prejudices, and experience. In the opening paragraph of The Common Law, he wrote:The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, and even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.[10]
All these themes can be found in Holmes's famous 1897 essay, ""The Path of the Law"". There Holmes attacks formalist approaches to judicial decision-making and states a pragmatic definition of law: ""The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law"".[11] If law is prophecy, Holmes continues, we must reject the view of ""text writers"" who tell us that law ""is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason that is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions"".[11]
Holmes introduced the ""bad-man"" theory of law: ""[I]f we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws"" about either the morality or the logic of the law. For the bad man, ""legal duty"" signifies only ""a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment"".[11] The bad man cares nothing for legal theorizing and concerns himself only with practical consequences. In the spirit of pragmatism, Holmes suggests that this is a useful way of laying bare the true meaning of legal concepts.
The utilitarian or instrumentalist flavor of ""The Path of the Law"" also found favor with the realists. The purpose of the law, Holmes insisted, was the deterrence of undesirable social consequences: ""I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage.""[12] Before the Civil War, this conception of adjudication as a form of social engineering had been widely shared by American judges, but in the late nineteenth century it had fallen out of favor.[13] One of the aspirations of both Holmes and the realists was to revive it. For example, in his dissent in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, Holmes wrote, ""The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky, but the articulate voice of some sovereign ... that can be identified,"" thereby arguing in favor of a pragmatic and more realistic approach to judicial interpretation of common law.[14]

Key themes[edit]
Drawing upon Holmes and other critics of legal formalism, a number of iconoclastic legal scholars launched the legal realist movement in the 1920s and 30s. Among the leading legal realists were Karl Llewellyn, Jerome Frank, Herman Oliphant, Underhill Moore, Walter Wheeler Cook, Leon Green, and Felix Cohen. Two American law schools, Yale and Columbia, were hotbeds of realist thought. Realism was a mood more than it was a cohesive movement, but it is possible to identify a number of common themes. These include:

A distrust of the judicial technique of seeming to deduce legal conclusions from so-called rules of law. The realists believed that judges neither do nor should decide cases formalistically. Law is not, as the formalists claimed, a system of rules that is clear, consistent, and complete. Rather, the law is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, gaps, vague terms, and conflicting rules of interpretation. As a result, there is often (perhaps always) no uniquely correct answer to any hard case that appellate judges decide. Law is incurably ""indeterminate"".
A belief in the instrumental nature of the law. Like Dewey and Pound, the realists believed that law does and should serve social ends. Judges take account of considerations of fairness and public policy, and they are right to do so.[15]
A desire to separate legal from moral elements in the law. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically. A clear distinction should be drawn between what the law is and what it should be. Law can only be viewed as an empirical science if moralistic notions are either excluded or are translated into empirically verifiable terms.[16] The idea that legal talk of ""duty"", ""right"", etc. is really just talk about how judges are likely to decide cases, is a clear example of how many realists tried to purge law of moralistic language and translate everything into ""realistic"" talk of actual consequences and testable predictions.
Criticisms[edit]
In the 1950s, legal realism was largely supplanted by the legal process movement, which viewed law as a process of ""reasoned elaboration"" and claimed that appeals to ""legislative purpose"" and other well-established legal norms could provide objectively correct answers to most legal questions. In his 1961 book The Concept of Law, British legal theorist H. L. A. Hart dealt what many scholars saw as a ""decisive blow""[17] to legal realism, by attacking the predictive theory of law that many realists had taken over from Holmes. Hart pointed out that if a law is just a prediction of what courts will do, a judge pondering the legal merits of a case before him is really asking, ""How will I decide this case?"" As Hart notes, this completely misses the fact that judges use legal rules to guide their decisions, not as data to predict their eventual holdings.
Many critics [who?] have claimed that the realists exaggerated the extent to which law is ""riddled"" with gaps, contradictions, and so forth.[18] Other critics, such as Ronald Dworkin and Lon Fuller, have faulted legal realists for their attempt to sharply separate law and morality.[19][20]

Influence and continuing relevance[edit]
Though many aspects of legal realism are now seen as exaggerated or outdated, most legal theorists would agree that the realists were successful in their central ambition: to refute ""formalist"" or ""mechanical"" notions of law and legal reasoning. It is widely accepted that law is not, and cannot be, an exact science, and that it is important to examine what judges are actually doing in deciding cases, not merely what they say they are doing. As ongoing debates about judicial activism and judicial restraint attest, legal scholars continue to disagree about when, if ever, it is legitimate for judges to ""make law"", as opposed to merely ""following"" or ""applying"" existing law.[21] But few would disagree with the realists' core claim that judges (for good or ill) are often strongly influenced by their political beliefs, their personal values, their individual personalities, and other extra-legal factors.[22]

Legal realism and the European Court of Human Rights[edit]
A statistical natural language processing method has been applied to automatically predict the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights (violation or no violation of a specific article) based on their textual contents, reaching a prediction accuracy of 79%.[23] A subsequent qualitative analysis of these results provided some support towards the theory of legal realism. The authors write: ""In general, and notwithstanding the simplified snapshot of a very complex debate that we just presented, our results could be understood as lending some support to the basic legal realist intuition according to which judges are primarily responsive to non-legal, rather than to legal, reasons when they decide hard cases.""

What occurred during the Tet Offensive?,"The Tet Offensive was a surprise military offensive launched by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong against major cities and military bases in South Vietnam on January 30, 1968. The offensive was the largest coordinated military assault in history and involved over 83,000 soldiers.

The NVA and Viet Cong launched attacks on the cities of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), Hue, Da Nang, and Khe Sanh, as well as several military bases. The attacks were met with fierce resistance from the South Vietnamese and U.S. military, and resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.

The Tet Offensive was a major propaganda victory for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, as it demonstrated their ability to conduct a large-scale surprise attack against the South Vietnamese government and U.S. forces. The offensive also led to a significant escalation of the war in Vietnam, as both sides increased their military activities in response.

The Tet Offensive had several specific details and examples, including:

* The NVA and Viet Cong launched attacks on the cities of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), Hue, Da Nang, and Khe Sanh, as well as several military bases.
* The NVA and Viet Cong used a variety of tactics, including infantry attacks, artillery bombardments, and air strikes.
* The South Vietnamese and U.S. military fought back with fierce resistance, using air strikes, artillery, and ground troops to defend against the attacks.
* The NVA and Viet Cong suffered heavy casualties during the offensive, with over 83,000 soldiers killed or wounded.
* The South Vietnamese and U.S. military also suffered significant casualties, with over 800 U.S. soldiers killed and over 1,000 wounded.
* The Tet Offensive led to a significant escalation of the war in Vietnam, as both sides increased their military activities in response.
* The Tet Offensive had a significant impact on public opinion in the United States, leading to increased support for the war and a shift towards a more aggressive military strategy.
* The Tet Offensive also had a significant impact on the South Vietnamese government, which was unable to effectively defend against the attacks and was forced to withdraw from several key cities.
* The Tet Offensive had a significant impact on the morale and discipline of the South Vietnamese and U.S. military, as many soldiers were demoralized by the heavy casualties and the failure to achieve significant victories.
* The Tet Offensive was a major propaganda victory for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, as it demonstrated their ability to conduct a large-scale surprise attack against the South Vietnamese government and U.S. forces.
* The Tet Offensive led to a significant increase in the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam, as President Lyndon B. Johnson sought to increase U.S. support for the war.
* The Tet Offensive also led to a significant increase in the number of U.S. casualties in Vietnam, as both sides increased their military activities in response to the offensive.
* The Tet Offensive had a significant impact on the North Vietnamese government, which was unable to effectively defend against the attacks and was forced to withdraw from several key cities.
* The Tet Offensive had a significant impact on the South Vietnamese government, which was unable to effectively defend against the attacks and was forced to withdraw from several key cities.
* The Tet Offensive had a significant impact on the U.S. public, as it demonstrated the capabilities of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong and led to increased support for the war.
* The Tet Offensive had a significant impact on the U.S. government, as it led to increased pressure on President Lyndon B. Johnson to increase U.S. support for the war.
* The Tet Offensive had a significant impact on the U.S. military, as it led to increased support for a more aggressive military strategy and a shift towards a more aggressive approach to the war.",True,https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/tet,"

U.S. Involvement in the Vietnam War: The Tet Offensive, 1968

In late January, 1968, during the lunar new year (or “Tet”) holiday, North
                    Vietnamese and communist Viet Cong forces launched a coordinated attack against
                    a number of targets in South Vietnam. The U.S. and South
                    Vietnamese militaries sustained heavy losses before finally repelling the
                    communist assault. The Tet Offensive played an important role in weakening U.S.
                    public support for the war in Vietnam. 


U.S. Captain Franklin Eller coordinates with military command during the
                        Tet Offensive

Ho Chi Minh and leaders in Hanoi planned the Tet Offensive
                    in the hopes of achieving a decisive victory that would end the grinding
                    conflict that frustrated military leaders on both sides. A successful attack on
                    major cities might force the United States to negotiate or perhaps even to
                    withdraw. At the very least, the North Vietnamese hoped it would serve to stop
                    the ongoing escalation of guerilla attacks and bombing in the North. Hanoi
                    selected the Tet holiday to strike because it was traditionally a time of truce,
                    and because Vietnamese traveling to spend the festival with their relatives
                    provided cover for the movement of South Vietnamese National Liberation
                        Forces (NLF) who supported the communist forces.
The first phase of the assault began on January 30 and 31, when NLF forces
                    simultaneously attacked a number of targets, mostly populated areas and places
                    with heavy U.S. troop presence. The strikes on the major cities of
                        Huế and Saigon had a strong
                    psychological impact, as they showed that the NLF troops were not as weak as the
                        Johnson Administration had previously claimed. The NLF
                    even managed to breach the outer walls of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. Although
                    the first phase of the offensive became the most famous, a second phase also
                    launched simultaneous assaults on smaller cities and towns on May 4 and
                    stretched into June. A third phase began in August and lasted six weeks. In the
                    months that followed, U.S. and South Vietnamese forces retook the towns that the
                    NLF had secured over the course of the offensive, but they incurred heavy
                    military and civilian casualties in the process.
At the end of the Tet Offensive, both sides had endured losses, and both sides
                    claimed victory. The U.S. and South Vietnamese military response almost
                    completely eliminated the NLF forces and regained all of the lost territory. At
                    the same time, the Tet Offensive weakened domestic support for the Johnson
                    Administration as the vivid reporting on the Tet Offensive by the U.S. media
                    made clear to the American public that an overall victory in Vietnam was not
                    imminent. 
The aftermath of Tet brought public discussions about de-escalation, but not
                    before U.S. generals asked for additional troops for a wide-scale “accelerated
                    pacification program.” Believing that the U.S. was in a position to defeat the
                    North, these military leaders sought to press for a U.S.-South Vietnam
                    offensive. Johnson and others, however, read the situation differently. Johnson
                    announced that the bombing of North Vietnam would cease
                    above the 20th parallel and placed a limit on U.S. troops in South
                        Vietnam. Johnson also attempted to set parameters for peace
                    talks, but it would be several more years before these came to fruition. Within
                    the United States, protests against continued involvement in Vietnam
                    intensified. On March 31, 1968, Johnson announced that he would not seek a
                    second term as president. The job of finding a way out of Vietnam was left to
                    the next U.S. president, Richard Nixon.

What is the Sloan Great Wall?,"The Sloan Great Wall is a large and complex structure that was discovered by astronomers in 2015. It is a set of interconnected filaments that stretch across the sky and connect galaxies at different distances. The structure is named after the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which first identified the wall.

The Sloan Great Wall is made up of thousands of individual filaments that are connected to form a large, interconnected structure. These filaments are made up of gas and dust that is pulled together by gravity, creating a network of clouds that stretch across the sky.

The Sloan Great Wall is located in a region of the universe known as the Local Void, which is a region of space that is devoid of large galaxy clusters. This region is filled with filaments that stretch across the sky and connect galaxies at different distances.

The Sloan Great Wall is a remarkable structure that is still being studied by astronomers. The filaments that make up the wall are made up of gas and dust that is pulled together by gravity, creating a network of clouds that stretch across the sky.

The Sloan Great Wall is an example of the intricate and complex structure of the universe, and it is a reminder of the power of gravity to pull together matter and create large, interconnected structures.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Great_Wall,"

Cosmic structure formed by a galaxy filament
Not to be confused with the CfA2 Great Wall.
The Sloan Great Wall in a DTFE reconstruction of the inner parts of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey
The Sloan Great Wall (SGW) is a cosmic structure formed by a giant wall of galaxies (a galaxy filament). Its discovery was announced from Princeton University on October 20, 2003, by J. Richard Gott III, Mario Jurić, and their colleagues, based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.[1]


Size[edit]
The wall measures 1.37 billion light-years (1.30×1025 m) in length, located approximately one billion light-years away. In the sky, it is located within the region of the constellations Corvus, Hydra and Centaurus. It is approximately 1/60 of the diameter of the observable universe, making it the sixth largest known object after the large quasar groups Clowes-Campusano LQG, U1.11, Huge-LQG, the Giant GRB Ring and the galaxy filament Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall (Her-CrB GW), respectively.
The Sloan Great Wall is between 1.8–2.7 times longer than the CfA2 Great Wall of galaxies (discovered by Margaret Geller and John Huchra of Harvard University in 1989).[2] It also contains several galactic superclusters, the largest and richest of which is named SCl 126. This is located in the highest density region of the structure.[3][4]
In 2011, it was suggested that the SGW is a chance alignment of three structures, and not a structure in itself.[5]

Assessing China's Digital Silk Road InitiativeA Transformative Approach to Technology Financing or a Danger to Freedoms?



































As part of China’s massive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the biggest infrastructure undertaking in the world, Beijing has launched the Digital Silk Road (DSR). Announced in 2015 with a loose mandate, the DSR has become a significant part of Beijing’s overall BRI strategy, under which China provides aid, political support, and other assistance to recipient states. DSR also provides support to Chinese exporters, including many well-known Chinese technology companies, such as Huawei. The DSR assistance goes toward improving recipients’ telecommunications networks, artificial intelligence capabilities, cloud computing, e-commerce and mobile payment systems, surveillance technology, smart cities, and other high-tech areas. 







China has already signed agreements on DSR cooperation with, or provided DSR-related investment to, at least sixteen countries [PDF]. But the true number of agreements and investments is likely much larger, because many of these go unreported: memoranda of understanding (MOUs) do not necessarily show whether China and another country have embarked upon close cooperation in the digital sphere. Some estimates suggest that one-third of the countries participating in BRI—138 at this point—are cooperating on DSR projects. In Africa, for instance, China already provides more financing for information and communications technology than all multilateral agencies and leading democracies combined do across the continent.

Leaders of many developing countries, as well as some developed ones such as South Korea, have signed DSR agreements. Although these MOUs are not legally binding, they show the scope of global interest in the DSR. Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia desperately need inexpensive, high-quality technology to expand wireless phone networks and broadband internet coverage. Overall, the world’s infrastructure financing gap is projected to reach nearly $15 trillion by 2040. DSR-related investments can help fill that gap and spark growth by providing or helping finance this critical infrastructure. Chinese firms are bringing additional benefits to developing countries by establishing training centers and research and development programs to boost cooperation between scientists and engineers in these countries and their Chinese counterparts, and to transfer technical knowledge in areas such as smart cities, artificial intelligence and robotics, and clean energy, among others. 







Still, some democracies have raised serious concerns about the Digital Silk Road. They worry that, at a time when Beijing is becoming more assertive on the global stage, China will use the DSR to enable recipient countries to adopt its model of technology-enabled authoritarianism, which would be detrimental to personal freedoms and sovereignty in those countries. Chinese technology companies have already helped governments in other countries develop surveillance capabilities that could be used against opposition groups, and Beijing has provided training for interested DSR recipient countries on how to monitor and censor the internet in real time. Although some of these Chinese companies are nominally private, even the private firms have drawn global scrutiny for state links as they are required by Chinese cybersecurity legislation to store data on servers in China and submit to checks from authorities. 







Moreover, allowing Chinese firms to build countries’ fifth-generation (5G) networks and other infrastructure, and to set technology standards that could become the norm in many countries, could risk espionage and coercion of other states’ politics if Beijing used data breaches to blackmail political elites in those states. The DSR could also help recipient countries better control their internets through filtering, content moderation, data localization, and surveillance. Doing so would accelerate a fracturing of the global internet, as some countries pursue these policies of internet control while others remain committed to internet freedoms.

Conclusion
The existing Digital Silk Road deals are just the start. Beijing is making the DSR a bigger foreign policy priority [PDF], as an increasing number of developed countries, including the United States, Australia, Japan, and some European states ban Chinese tech firms from their 5G infrastructure; launch broader strategies to limit Chinese tech giants’ expansion; and try to prevent Beijing from setting standards for the internet, 5G networking, and other areas. Chinese technology firms therefore need even greater growth in developing markets as they are excluded from wealthier states.The coronavirus pandemic, which has led many governments to monitor their populations, has only added [PDF] to the demand in developing states for Chinese telecommunications and surveillance tools. In response, Beijing has linked the DSR to the Health Silk Road, a subset of the BRI that supports health infrastructure.But as the DSR expands, concerns about its influence on recipient states will likely mount as well. Some developing countries, such as India, have expressed similar qualms as the United States and Europe have about China’s tech offensive. And policymakers in states such as Myanmar and Malaysia, another country involved in DSR projects, have expressed growing concerns over sovereignty and excessive debt. Beijing’s increasingly brittle and nationalist diplomacy is also undermining its efforts to assuage policymakers in developing states—even longtime close partners like Malaysia—about the potential downsides of DSR and BRI more generally.

To be sure, China is not the only country whose major tech companies have participated in surveillance, cooperation with their countries’ militaries, and espionage abroad. Some U.S. tech giants have also used their networks to facilitate surveillance, espionage, and defense operations. U.S. companies such as Gatekeeper Systems also have sold facial recognition technology to authoritarian states such as Saudi Arabia. And, regardless of China’s actions, many governments have clear demands for surveillance and artificial intelligence infrastructure, as well as other technologies that raise serious concerns about privacy.Despite concerns raised by developed states and some developing countries about aspects of DSR, Beijing will keep pushing forward. China has already spent an estimated $79 billion [PDF] on DSR-related projects, and its DSR assistance will likely grow substantially throughout the 2020s. At major China-sponsored international summits such as the World Internet Conference and the Belt and Road Forum, Beijing has promoted [PDF] DSR as a top Chinese priority.As the Digital Silk Road expands, the conflicts around it—between countries signing up for DSR and those concerned about its downsides and between groups within countries worried about its detrimental effects and some governments that stand to benefit—will only intensify. 








MethodologyThe interactive map lists states known to be participating in the Digital Silk Road. The list of states was compiled from news reports, studies of DSR and Chinese digital assistance to other countries, and DSR signing agreements. It does not include every country to which China provides some digital aid, financing or investment, as many of these aid and investment deals remain opaque.

"
What is the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus?,"The Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) virus is a zoonotic disease that can cause severe illness and even death in humans and animals. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, which feed on animals that are infected with the virus.

The virus was first identified in 1956 in Crimea, Ukraine, and it is also known as the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever. The virus was named after the regions where it was first identified.

The disease is endemic in several countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, including Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and others.

The symptoms of CCHF include fever, headache, muscle pain, and a rash. The disease progresses to a severe phase, characterized by bleeding from the nose, mouth, and other mucous membranes, abdominal pain, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, the disease can cause organ failure and death.

In 2017, a major outbreak of CCHF occurred in the eastern regions of Ukraine, affecting more than 1,000 people and causing 90 deaths. The outbreak was caused by the spread of the virus from infected ticks that had fed on wild animals, such as roe deer, badgers, and foxes, which had been infected with the virus.

The disease has also been reported in other countries, including Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. In 2012, a major outbreak of CCHF occurred in the Republic of Dagestan in Russia, affecting more than 1,000 people and causing 80 deaths.

The virus is not highly contagious and can be prevented by avoiding contact with infected animals, using insect repellent, and following good hygiene practices. There is no specific treatment for CCHF, but supportive care can help to manage the symptoms and prevent complications.

In conclusion, the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus is a zoonotic disease that can cause severe illness and even death in humans and animals. The virus is transmitted through the bite of infected ticks, and it is endemic in several countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. The disease can be prevented by avoiding contact with infected animals, using insect repellent, and following good hygiene practices, and there is no specific treatment for CCHF, but supportive care can help to manage the symptoms and prevent complications.",True,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever,"

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
















Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever

23 May 2022
















Key facts

The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks.
CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40%.
The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.
CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north.
There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.



OverviewCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10–40%. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north – the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in animals and ticksThe hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas, where they have been at the origin of human cases. For example, a former outbreak occurred at an ostrich abattoir in South Africa. There is no apparent disease in these animals.Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus Hyalomma are the principal vector.Transmission The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.Signs and symptomsThe length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to three days, with a maximum of nine days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena. There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness. The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness. Diagnosis CCHF virus infection can be diagnosed by several different laboratory tests:enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ;antigen detection;serum neutralization;reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay; andvirus isolation by cell culture.Patients with fatal disease, as well as in patients in the first few days of illness, do not usually develop a measurable antibody response and so diagnosis in these individuals is achieved by virus or RNA detection in blood or tissue samples. Tests on patient samples present an extreme biohazard risk and should only be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. However, if samples have been inactivated (e.g. with virucides, gamma rays, formaldehyde, heat, etc.), they can be manipulated in a basic biosafety environment. TreatmentGeneral supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCHF in people. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective. Prevention and control Controlling CCHF in animals and ticksTicks of the genus Hyalomma are the principal vector of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. Photo: Robert Swanepoel/NICD South AfricaIt is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities. For example, following an outbreak at an ostrich abattoir in South Africa (noted above), measures were taken to ensure that ostriches remained tick free for 14 days in a quarantine station before slaughter. This decreased the risk for the animal to be infected during its slaughtering and prevented human infection for those in contact with the livestock.There are no vaccines available for use in animals.Reducing the risk of infection in people Although an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.Public health advice should focus on several aspects.Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission: wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; andavoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active. Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission: wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides two weeks prior to slaughter.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community: avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.Controlling infection in health-care settingsHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices. As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions. Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.Recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever.WHO responseWHO is working with partners to support CCHF surveillance, diagnostic capacity and outbreak response activities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.WHO also provides documentation to help disease investigation and control, and has created an aide–memoire on standard precautions in health care, which is intended to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne and other pathogens.

What is Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease?,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. It is caused by abnormal proteins called prions, which are abnormal versions of a normal protein called prion protein.

CJD typically affects people over the age of 50, although it can occur at any age. The disease is most commonly found in people who are older, but it can also occur in younger people.

The symptoms of CJD can vary widely, but they typically include:

* Rapid and progressive changes in behavior and personality
* Changes in vision and hearing
* Difficulty walking and speaking
* Loss of coordination and balance
* Seizures and convulsions
* Loss of muscle control and tremors

CJD is usually fatal within a few months to a few years of the onset of symptoms.

There are two types of CJD: sporadic CJD and inherited CJD. Sporadic CJD is the most common type and occurs when there is no known risk factor for the disease. Inherited CJD is caused by a genetic mutation and is passed down through families.

There have been several high-profile cases of CJD in recent years, including the deaths of athletes such as Olympic wrestler Kurt Angle and former NFL player Dave Duerson. In addition, there have been several high-profile cases of CJD in the United Kingdom, including the deaths of several celebrities such as actor MichaelTagMode, and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, John Major.

CJD is a rare disease, but it is important to be aware of the symptoms and risk factors to ensure that it is properly diagnosed and treated. If you or someone you know has symptoms that may be consistent with CJD, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.",True,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20371226,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - Symptoms & causes - Mayo Clinic

It belongs to a group of human and animal diseases known as prion disorders. Symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. But Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually gets worse much faster and leads to death.Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) received public attention in the 1990s when some people in the United Kingdom became sick with a form of the disease. They developed variant CJ, known as vCJD, after eating meat from diseased cattle. However, most cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease haven't been linked to eating beef.All types of CJD are serious but are very rare. About 1 to 2 cases of CJD are diagnosed per million people around the world each year. The disease most often affects older adults.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital EditionSymptomsCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease is marked by changes in mental abilities. Symptoms get worse quickly, usually within several weeks to a few months. Early symptoms include:
Personality changes.
Memory loss.
Impaired thinking.
Blurry vision or blindness.
Insomnia.
Problems with coordination.
Trouble speaking.
Trouble swallowing.
Sudden, jerky movements.
Death usually occurs within a year. People with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually die of medical issues associated with the disease. They might include having trouble swallowing, falls, heart issues, lung failure, or pneumonia or other infections.In people with variant CJD, changes in mental abilities may be more apparent in the beginning of the disease. In many cases, dementia develops later in the illness. Symptoms of dementia include the loss of the ability to think, reason and remember.Variant CJD affects people at a younger age than CJD. Variant CJD appears to last 12 to 14 months.Another rare form of prion disease is called variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr). It can mimic other forms of dementia. It causes changes in mental abilities and problems with speech and thinking. The course of the disease is longer than other prion diseases — about 24 months. Request an appointmentCausesCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease and related conditions appear to be caused by changes to a type of protein called a prion. These proteins are typically produced in the body. But when they encounter infectious prions, they fold and become another shape that's not typical. They can spread and affect processes in the body.How prions fold
        Prions are proteins that occur naturally in the brains of animals and people. Normally, the proteins are harmless, but when they're misshapen, they can cause devastating illnesses such as  disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.
        How Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease developsThe risk of getting CJD is low. The disease can't be spread through coughing or sneezing. It also can't be spread by touching or sexual contact. CJD can develop in three ways:
Sporadically. Most people with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease develop the disease for no apparent reason. This type, called spontaneous CJD or sporadic CJD, accounts for most cases.
 By inheritance. Fewer than 15% of people with CJD have a family history. They may test positive for genetic changes associated with the disease. This type is referred to as familial CJD. Changes in a gene called PRNP that makes prion protein cause the genetic forms of the disease. Rare genetic forms also include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome. This syndrome causes problems with movement and cognition. It often affects people in their 40s. Another rare genetic form includes fatal familial insomnia. This causes an inability to sleep and changes in memory and thinking. 
 By contamination. A small number of people have developed CJD as a result of medical procedures. These procedures included injections of pituitary human growth hormone from an infected source. They also included cornea and skin transplants from people who had CJD. Medical centers have changed their procedures to eliminate these risks. Also, a few people have developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after brain surgery with contaminated instruments. This happened because standard cleaning methods don't destroy the prions that cause the disease. Today instruments that may have been contaminated with CJD are destroyed. Cases related to medical procedures are referred to as iatrogenic CJD. A small number of people have developed variant CJD from eating contaminated beef. Variant CJD is linked to eating beef from cattle infected with mad cow disease. Mad cow disease is known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). 
Risk factorsMost cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occur for unknown reasons. So risk factors can't be identified. But a few factors seem to be associated with different kinds of CJD.
Age. Sporadic CJD tends to develop later in life, usually around age 60. Onset of familial CJD occurs slightly earlier. And variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has affected people at a much younger age, usually in their late 20s.
Genetics. People with familial CJD have genetic changes that cause the disease. To develop this form of the disease, a child must have one copy of the gene that causes CJD. The gene can be passed down from either parent. If you have the gene, the chance of passing it on to your children is 50%.
Exposure to contaminated tissue. People who've received infected human growth hormone may be at risk of iatrogenic CJD. Receiving a transplant of tissue that covers the brain, called dura mater, from someone with CJD also can put a person at risk of iatrogenic CJD.The risk of getting vCJD from eating contaminated beef is very low. In countries that have implemented effective public health measures, the risk is virtually nonexistent. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, reindeer and moose. It has been found in some areas of North America. To date, no documented cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) have caused disease in humans.
Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
        In an autosomal dominant disorder, the changed gene, also called a mutation, is a dominant gene. It's located on one of the nonsex chromosomes, called autosomes. You need only one changed gene to be affected by this type of disorder. A person with an autosomal dominant disorder — in this example, the father — has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one changed gene. The person has a 50% chance of having an unaffected child.
        ComplicationsCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease has serious effects on the brain and body. The disease usually progresses quickly. Over time, people with CJD withdraw from friends and family. They also lose the ability to care for themselves. Many slip into a coma. The disease is always fatal.PreventionThere's no known way to prevent sporadic CJD. If you have a family history of neurological disease, you may benefit from talking with a genetics counselor. A counselor can help you sort through your risks.Preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease related to medical proceduresHospitals and other medical institutions follow clear policies to prevent CJD related to medical procedures, known as iatrogenic CJD. These measures have included:
Using only human-made human growth hormone. This is used instead of taking the hormone from human pituitary glands.
Destroying surgical instruments that may have been exposed to CJD. This includes instruments used in procedures that involve the brain or nervous tissue of someone with known or suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Single-use kits for spinal taps, also known as lumbar punctures.
To help ensure the safety of the blood supply, people with a risk of exposure to CJD or vCJD aren't eligible to donate blood in the United States. This includes people who:
Have a blood relative who has been diagnosed with familial CJD. Blood relatives include parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins.
Have received a dura mater brain graft. Dura mater is the tissue that covers the brain.
Have received human growth hormone from cadavers.
The United Kingdom (U.K.) and certain other countries also have specific restrictions regarding blood donations from people with a risk of exposure to CJD or vCJD.Preventing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseThe risk of getting vCJD in the United States remains very low. Only four cases have been reported in the U.S. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), strong evidence suggests that these cases were acquired in other countries outside of the U.S.In the United Kingdom (U.K.), where the majority of vCJD cases have occurred, fewer than 200 cases have been reported. CJD incidence peaked in the U.K. between 1999 and 2000 and has been declining since. A very small number of other vCJD cases also have been reported in other countries worldwide.To date, there is no evidence that people can develop Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from consuming the meat of animals infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD). However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that hunters strongly consider taking precautions. The CDC recommends having deer and elk tested before eating the meat in areas where CWD is known to be present. Hunters also should avoid shooting or handling meat from deer or elk that appear sick or are found dead.Regulating potential sources of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseMost countries have taken steps to prevent meat infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from entering the food supply. Steps include:
Tight restrictions on importing cattle from countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is common.
Restrictions on animal feed.
Strict procedures for dealing with sick animals.
Surveillance and testing methods for tracking cattle health.
Restrictions on which parts of cattle can be processed for food.

What is the Eta Carinae star system?,"Eta Carinae is a binary star system located in the constellation Carina. The system consists of a pair of massive stars, known as Eta Carinae A and Eta Carinae B, which are located about 10,000 light-years away from Earth.

Eta Carinae A is a luminous blue variable star, which means that its brightness can vary over a period of several years. It is also known as the ""Luminous Blue Variable"" or LBV. Eta Carinae B is a smaller, cooler star that orbits around Eta Carinae A.

Eta Carinae is a famous supernova candidate, which means that it is considered to be one of the most likely candidates to explode as a supernova in the future. However, the explosion of Eta Carinae is still uncertain, and it may not occur for several hundred years.

The discovery of Eta Carinae was made by the astronomer William Herschel in 1782. The system was later studied in detail by the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis in the early 20th century.

In 2003, the Eta Carinae Nebula, which is a large, diffuse nebula located near the stars, was observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The nebula is a remnant of the explosion that will eventually occur in Eta Carinae.

Eta Carinae is a fascinating star system that continues to be studied by astronomers to this day. It is a reminder of the incredible power of the universe and the potential for massive explosions to occur in our galaxy.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae,"

η Carinae (Eta Carinae, abbreviated to η Car), formerly known as η Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity greater than five million times that of the Sun, located around 7,500 light-years (2,300 parsecs) distant in the constellation Carina. Previously a 4th-magnitude star, it brightened in 1837 to become brighter than Rigel, marking the start of its so-called ""Great Eruption"". It became the second-brightest star in the sky between 11–14 March 1843 before fading well below naked-eye visibility after 1856. In a smaller eruption, it reached 6th magnitude in 1892 before fading again. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, becoming brighter than magnitude 4.5 by 2014.
At declination −59° 41′ 04.26″, η Carinae is circumpolar from locations on Earth south of latitude 30°S (for reference, the latitude of Johannesburg is 26°12′S), and is not visible north of about latitude 30°N, just south of Cairo (which is at a latitude of 30°02′N).
The two main stars of the η Carinae system have an eccentric orbit with a period of 5.54 years. The primary is an extremely unusual star, similar to a luminous blue variable (LBV). It was initially 150–250 M☉, of which it has already lost at least 30 M☉, and it is expected to explode as a supernova in the astronomically near future. This is the only star known to produce ultraviolet laser emission. The secondary star is hot and also highly luminous, probably of spectral class O, around 30–80 times as massive as the Sun. The system is heavily obscured by the Homunculus Nebula, which consists of material ejected from the primary during the Great Eruption. It is a member of the Trumpler 16 open cluster, itself embedded in the much larger Carina Nebula.
Although unrelated to the star and nebula, the weak Eta Carinids meteor shower has a radiant very close to η Carinae.


Observational history[edit]
η Carinae was first recorded as a fourth-magnitude star in the 16th or 17th century. It became the second-brightest star in the sky in the mid-19th century, before fading below naked-eye visibility. During the second half of the 20th century, it slowly brightened to again become visible to the naked eye, and by 2014 was again a fourth-magnitude star.

Discovery and naming[edit]
There is no reliable evidence of η Carinae being observed or recorded before the 17th century, although Dutch navigator Pieter Keyser described a fourth-magnitude star at approximately the correct position around 1595–1596, which was copied onto the celestial globes of Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and the 1603 Uranometria of Johann Bayer. Frederick de Houtman's independent star catalogue from 1603 does not include η Carinae among the other 4th magnitude stars in the region. The earliest firm record was made by Edmond Halley in 1677 when he recorded the star simply as Sequens (i.e. ""following"" relative to another star) within a new constellation Robur Carolinum. His Catalogus Stellarum Australium was published in 1679.[25] The star was also known by the Bayer designations η Roboris Caroli, η Argus, or η Navis.[2] In 1751 Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave the stars of Argo Navis and Robur Carolinum a single set of Greek letter Bayer designations within his constellation Argo, and designated three areas within Argo for the purposes of using Latin letter designations three times over. The letter η fell within the keel portion of the ship which was later to become the constellation Carina.[26] It was not generally known as η Carinae until 1879, when the stars of Argo Navis were finally given the epithets of the daughter constellations in the Uranometria Argentina of Gould.[27]
η Carinae is too far south to be part of the mansion-based traditional Chinese astronomy, but it was mapped when the Southern Asterisms were created at the start of the 17th century. Together with s Carinae, λ Centauri and λ Muscae, η Carinae forms the asterism 海山 (Sea and Mountain).[28] η Carinae has the names Tseen She (from the Chinese 天社 [Mandarin: tiānshè] ""Heaven's altar"") and Foramen. It is also known as 海山二 (Hǎi Shān èr, English: the Second Star of Sea and Mountain).[29]
Halley gave an approximate apparent magnitude 4 at the time of discovery, which has been calculated as magnitude 3.3 on the modern scale. The handful of possible earlier sightings suggest that η Carinae was not significantly brighter than this for much of the 17th century.[2] Further sporadic observations over the next 70 years show that η Carinae was probably around 3rd magnitude or fainter, until Lacaille reliably recorded it at 2nd magnitude in 1751.[2] It is unclear whether η Carinae varied significantly in brightness over the next 50 years; there are occasional observations such as William Burchell's at 4th magnitude in 1815, but it is uncertain whether these are just re-recordings of earlier observations.[2]

Great Eruption[edit]
The lightcurve of η Carinae from some of the earliest observations to the current day
In 1827, Burchell specifically noted η Carinae's unusual brightness at 1st magnitude, and was the first to suspect that it varied in brightness.[2] John Herschel, who was in South Africa at the time, made a detailed series of accurate measurements in the 1830s showing that η Carinae consistently shone around magnitude 1.4 until November 1837. On the evening of 16 December 1837, Herschel was astonished to see that it had brightened to slightly outshine Rigel.[30] This event marked the beginning of a roughly 18-year period known as the Great Eruption.[2]
η Carinae was brighter still on 27 January 1838, equivalent to Alpha Centauri, before fading slightly over the following three months. Herschel did not observe the star after this, but received correspondence from the Reverend W.S. Mackay in Calcutta, who wrote in 1843, ""To my great surprise I observed this March last (1843), that the star η Argus had become a star of the first magnitude fully as bright as Canopus, and in colour and size very like Arcturus."" Observations at the Cape of Good Hope indicated it peaked in brightness, surpassing Canopus, from 11 to 14 March 1843, then began to fade, then brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri and Canopus between 24 and 28 March before fading once again.[30] For much of 1844 the brightness was midway between Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri, around magnitude +0.2, before brightening again at the end of the year. At its brightest in 1843 it likely reached an apparent magnitude of −0.8, then −1.0 in 1845.[12] The peaks in 1827, 1838 and 1843 are likely to have occurred at the periastron passage—the point the two stars are closest together—of the binary orbit.[9] From 1845 to 1856, the brightness decreased by around 0.1 magnitudes per year, but with possible rapid and large fluctuations.[12]
In their oral traditions, the Boorong clan of the Wergaia people of Lake Tyrrell, north-western Victoria, Australia, told of a reddish star they knew as Collowgullouric War /ˈkɒləɡʌlərɪk ˈwɑːr/ ""Old Woman Crow"", the wife of War ""Crow"" (Canopus).[31] In 2010, astronomers Duane Hamacher and David Frew from Macquarie University in Sydney showed that this was η Carinae during its Great Eruption in the 1840s.[32] From 1857, the brightness decreased rapidly until it faded below naked-eye visibility by 1886. This has been calculated to be due to the condensation of dust in the ejected material surrounding the star, rather than to an intrinsic change in luminosity.[33]

Lesser Eruption[edit]
A new brightening started in 1887, peaked at about magnitude 6.2 in 1892, then at the end of March 1895 faded rapidly to about magnitude 7.5.[2] Although there are only visual records of the 1890 eruption, it has been calculated that η Carinae was suffering 4.3 magnitudes of visual extinction due to the gas and dust ejected in the Great Eruption. An unobscured brightness would have been magnitude 1.5–1.9, significantly brighter than the historical magnitude. Despite this, it was similar to the first one, even almost matching its brightness, but not the amount of material expelled.[34][35][36]

Twentieth century[edit]
Between 1900 and at least 1940, η Carinae appeared to have settled at a constant brightness of around magnitude 7.6,[2] but in 1953 it was noted to have brightened again to magnitude 6.5.[37] The brightening continued steadily, but with fairly regular variations of a few tenths of a magnitude.[9]

Light curve for η Carinae between 1972 and 2019
In 1996, the variations were first identified as having a 5.52 year period,[9] later measured more accurately at 5.54 years, leading to the idea of a binary system. The binary theory was confirmed by observations of radio, optical and near-infrared radial velocity and line profile changes, referred to collectively as a spectroscopic event, at the predicted time of periastron passage in late 1997 and early 1998.[38] At the same time there was a complete collapse of the X-ray emission presumed to originate in a colliding wind zone.[39] The confirmation of a luminous binary companion greatly modified the understanding of the physical properties of the η Carinae system and its variability.[6]
A sudden doubling of brightness was observed in 1998–99 bringing it back to naked-eye visibility. During the 2014 spectroscopic event, the apparent visual magnitude became brighter than magnitude 4.5.[40] The brightness does not always vary consistently at different wavelengths, and does not always exactly follow the 5.5 year cycle.[41][42] Radio, infrared and space-based observations have expanded coverage of η Carinae across all wavelengths and revealed ongoing changes in the spectral energy distribution.[43]
In July 2018, η Carinae was reported to have the strongest colliding wind shock in the solar neighbourhood. Observations with the NuSTAR satellite gave much higher resolution data than the earlier Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Using direct focussing observations of the non-thermal source in the extremely hard X-ray band that is spatially coincident with the star, they showed that the source of non-thermal X-rays varies with the orbital phase of the binary star system and that the photon index of the emission is similar to that derived through analysis of the γ-ray (gamma) spectrum.[44][45]

Visibility[edit]

Position of η Carinae (top left) compared to PP Carinae (bottom right)
As a fourth-magnitude star, η Carinae is comfortably visible to the naked eye in all but the most light-polluted skies in inner-city areas according to the Bortle scale.[46] Its brightness has varied over a wide range, from the second-brightest star in the sky for a few days in the 19th century, to well below naked-eye visibility. Its location at around 60°S in the far southern celestial hemisphere means it cannot be seen by observers in Europe and much of North America.
Located between Canopus and the Southern Cross,[47] η Carinae is easily pinpointed as the brightest star within the large naked-eye Carina Nebula. In a telescope the ""star"" is framed within the dark ""V"" dust lane of the nebula and appears distinctly orange and clearly non-stellar.[48] High magnification will show the two orange lobes of a surrounding reflection nebula known as the Homunculus Nebula on either side of a bright central core. Variable star observers can compare its brightness with several 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars closely surrounding the nebula.
Discovered in 1961, the weak Eta Carinids meteor shower has a radiant very close to η Carinae. Occurring from 14 to 28 January, the shower peaks around 21 January. Meteor showers are not associated with bodies outside the Solar System, making the proximity to η Carinae merely a coincidence.[49]

Visual spectrum[edit]

The strength and profile of the lines in the η Carinae spectrum are highly variable, but there are a number of consistent distinctive features. The spectrum is dominated by emission lines, usually broad although the higher excitation lines are overlaid by a narrow central component from dense ionised nebulosity, especially the Weigelt Blobs. Most lines show a P Cygni profile but with the absorption wing much weaker than the emission. The broad P Cygni lines are typical of strong stellar winds, with very weak absorption in this case because the central star is so heavily obscured. Electron scattering wings are present but relatively weak, indicating a clumpy wind. Hydrogen lines are present and strong, showing that η Carinae still retains much of its hydrogen envelope.
HeI[c] lines are much weaker than the hydrogen lines, and the absence of HeII lines provides an upper limit to the possible temperature of the primary star. NII lines can be identified but are not strong, while carbon lines cannot be detected and oxygen lines are at best very weak, indicating core hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle with some mixing to the surface. Perhaps the most striking feature is the rich FeII emission in both permitted and forbidden lines, with the forbidden lines arising from excitation of low density nebulosity around the star.[18][50]
The earliest analyses of the star's spectrum are descriptions of visual observations from 1869, of prominent emission lines ""C, D, b, F and the principal green nitrogen line"". Absorption lines are explicitly described as not being visible.[51] The letters refer to Fraunhofer's spectral notation and correspond to Hα, HeI,[d] FeII, and Hβ.
It is assumed that the final line is from FeII very close to the green nebulium line now known to be from OIII.[52]
Photographic spectra from 1893 were described as similar to an F5 star, but with a few weak emission lines. Analysis to modern spectral standards suggests an early F spectral type. By 1895 the spectrum again consisted mostly of strong emission lines, with the absorption lines present but largely obscured by emission. This spectral transition from F supergiant to strong emission is characteristic of novae, where ejected material initially radiates like a pseudo-photosphere and then the emission spectrum develops as it expands and thins.[52]
The emission line spectrum associated with dense stellar winds has persisted ever since the late 19th century. Individual lines show widely varying widths, profiles and Doppler shifts, often multiple velocity components within the same line. The spectral lines also show variation over time, most strongly with a 5.5-year period but also less dramatic changes over shorter and longer periods, as well as ongoing secular development of the entire spectrum.[53][54] The spectrum of light reflected from the Weigelt Blobs, and assumed to originate mainly with the primary, is similar to the extreme P Cygni-type star HDE 316285 which has a spectral type of B0Ieq.[17]

Direct spectral observations did not begin until after the Great Eruption, but light echoes from the eruption reflected from other parts of the Carina Nebula were detected using the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory's Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Analysis of the reflected spectra indicated the light was emitted when η Carinae had the appearance of a 5,000 K G2-to-G5 supergiant, some 2,000 K cooler than expected from other supernova impostor events.[55] Further light echo observations show that following the peak brightness of the Great Eruption the spectrum developed prominent P Cygni profiles and CN molecular bands, although this is likely from the material being ejected which may have been colliding with circumstellar material in a similar way to a type IIn supernova.[56]
In the second half of the 20th century, much higher-resolution visual spectra became available. The spectrum continued to show complex and baffling features, with much of the energy from the central star being recycled into the infrared by surrounding dust, some reflection of light from the star from dense localised objects in the circumstellar material, but with obvious high-ionisation features indicative of very high temperatures. The line profiles are complex and variable, indicating a number of absorption and emission features at various velocities relative to the central star.[57][58]
The 5.5-year orbital cycle produces strong spectral changes at periastron that are known as spectroscopic events. Certain wavelengths of radiation suffer eclipses, either due to actual occultation by one of the stars or due to passage within opaque portions of the complex stellar winds. Despite being ascribed to orbital rotation, these events vary significantly from cycle to cycle. These changes have become stronger since 2003 and it is generally believed that long-term secular changes in the stellar winds or previously ejected material may be the culmination of a return to the state of the star before its Great Eruption.[42][43][59]

Ultraviolet[edit]
Ultraviolet image of Homunculus Nebula taken by ESA / Hubble 
The ultraviolet spectrum of the η Carinae system shows many emission lines of ionised metals such as FeII and CrII, as well as Lymanα (Lyα) and a continuum from a hot central source. The ionisation levels and continuum require the existence of a source with a temperature at least 37,000 K.[60]
Certain FeII UV lines are unusually strong. These originate in the Weigelt Blobs and are caused by a low-gain lasing effect. Ionised hydrogen between a blob and the central star generates intense Lyα emission which penetrates the blob. The blob contains atomic hydrogen with a small admixture of other elements, including iron photo-ionised by radiation from the central stars. An accidental resonance (where emission coincidentally has a suitable energy to pump the excited state) allows the Lyα emission to pump the Fe+ ions to certain pseudo-metastable states,[61] creating a population inversion that allows the stimulated emission to take place.[62] This effect is similar to the maser emission from dense pockets surrounding many cool supergiant stars, but the latter effect is much weaker at optical and UV wavelengths and η Carinae is the only clear instance detected of an ultraviolet astrophysical laser. A similar effect from pumping of metastable OI states by Lyβ emission has also been confirmed as an astrophysical UV laser.[63]

Infrared[edit]
Stars similar to η Carinae in nearby galaxies
Infrared observations of η Carinae have become increasingly important. The vast majority of the electromagnetic radiation from the central stars is absorbed by surrounding dust, then emitted as mid- and far infrared appropriate to the temperature of the dust. This allows almost the entire energy output of the system to be observed at wavelengths that are not strongly affected by interstellar extinction, leading to estimates of the luminosity that are more accurate than for other extremely luminous stars. η Carinae is the brightest source in the night sky at mid-infrared wavelengths.[64]
Far infrared observations show a large mass of dust at 100–150 K, suggesting a total mass for the Homunculus of 20 solar masses (M☉) or more. This is much larger than previous estimates, and is all thought to have been ejected in a few years during the Great Eruption.[8]
Near-infrared observations can penetrate the dust at high resolution to observe features that are completely obscured at visual wavelengths, although not the central stars themselves. The central region of the Homunculus contains a smaller Little Homunculus from the 1890 eruption, a butterfly of separate clumps and filaments from the two eruptions, and an elongated stellar wind region.[65]

High energy radiation[edit]
X-rays around η Carinae (red is low energy, blue higher)
Several X-ray and gamma ray sources have been detected around η Carinae, for example 4U 1037–60 in the 4th Uhuru catalogue and 1044–59 in the HEAO-2 catalog. The earliest detection of X-rays in the η Carinae region was from the Terrier-Sandhawk rocket,[66] followed by Ariel 5,[67] OSO 8,[68] and Uhuru[69] sightings.
More detailed observations were made with the Einstein Observatory,[70] ROSAT X-ray telescope,[71] Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA),[72] and Chandra X-ray Observatory. There are multiple sources at various wavelengths right across the high energy electromagnetic spectrum: hard X-rays and gamma rays within 1 light-month of the η Carinae; hard X-rays from a central region about 3 light-months wide; a distinct partial ring ""horse-shoe"" structure in low-energy X-rays 0.67 parsec (2.2 light-years) across corresponding to the main shockfront from the Great Eruption; diffuse X-ray emission across the whole area of the Homunculus; and numerous condensations and arcs outside the main ring.[73][74][75][76]
All the high-energy emission associated with η Carinae varies during the orbital cycle. A spectroscopic minimum, or X-ray eclipse, occurred in July and August 2003, and similar events in 2009 and 2014 have been intensively observed.[77] The highest-energy gamma rays above 100 MeV detected by AGILE show strong variability, while lower-energy gamma rays observed by Fermi show little variability.[73][78]

Radio emission[edit]
Radio emissions have been observed from η Carinae across the microwave band. It has been detected in the 21 cm HI line, but has been particularly closely studied in the millimetre and centimetre bands. Masing hydrogen recombination lines (from the combining of an electron and proton to form a hydrogen atom) have been detected in this range. The emission is concentrated in a small non-point source less than 4 arcseconds across and appears to be mainly free-free emission (thermal bremsstrahlung) from ionised gas, consistent with a compact HII region at around 10,000 K.[79] High resolution imaging shows the radio frequencies originating from a disk a few arcseconds in diameter, 10,000 astronomical units (AU) wide at the distance of η Carinae.[80]
The radio emission from η Carinae shows continuous variation in strength and distribution over a 5.5 year cycle. The HII and recombination lines vary very strongly, with continuum emission (electromagnetic radiation across a broad band of wavelengths) less affected. This shows a dramatic reduction in the ionisation level of the hydrogen for a short period in each cycle, coinciding with the spectroscopic events at other wavelengths.[80][81]

Surroundings[edit]
Main article: Carina Nebula
Annotated image of Carina Nebula
η Carinae is found within the Carina Nebula, a giant star-forming region in the Carina–Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way. The nebula is a prominent naked-eye object in the southern skies showing a complex mix of emission, reflection and dark nebulosity. η Carinae is known to be at the same distance as the Carina Nebula and its spectrum can be seen reflected off various star clouds in the nebula.[82] The appearance of the Carina Nebula, and particularly of the Keyhole region, has changed significantly since it was described by John Herschel over 160 years ago.[52] This is thought to be due to the reduction in ionising radiation from Eta Carinae since the Great Eruption.[83] Prior to the Great Eruption the η Carinae system contributed up to 20% of the total ionising flux for the whole Carina Nebula, but that is now mostly blocked by the surrounding gas and dust.[82]

Trumpler 16[edit]
Main article: Trumpler 16
η Carinae lies within the scattered stars of the Trumpler 16 open cluster. All the other members are well below naked eye visibility, although WR 25 is another extremely massive luminous star.[84] Trumpler 16 and its neighbour Trumpler 14 are the two dominant star clusters of the Carina OB1 association, an extended grouping of young luminous stars with a common motion through space.[85]

Homunculus[edit]
Main article: Homunculus Nebula
A 3D model of the Homunculus Nebula
η Carinae is enclosed by, and lights up, the Homunculus Nebula,[86] a small emission and reflection nebula composed mainly of gas ejected during the Great Eruption event in the mid-19th century, as well as dust that condensed from the debris. The nebula consists of two polar lobes aligned with the rotation axis of the star, plus an equatorial ""skirt"", the whole being around 18″ long.[87] Closer studies show many fine details: a Little Homunculus within the main nebula, probably formed by the 1890 eruption; a jet; fine streams and knots of material, especially noticeable in the skirt region; and three Weigelt Blobs—dense gas condensations very close to the star itself.[63][88]
The lobes of the Homunculus are considered to be formed almost entirely due to the initial eruption, rather than shaped by or including previously ejected or interstellar material, although the scarcity of material near the equatorial plane allows some later stellar wind and ejected material to mix. Therefore, the mass of the lobes gives an accurate measure of the scale of the Great Eruption, with estimates ranging from 12–15 M☉ up to as high as 45 M☉.[8][20][89] The results show that the material from the Great Eruption is strongly concentrated towards the poles; 75% of the mass and 90% of the kinetic energy were released above latitude 45°.[90]
A unique feature of the Homunculus is the ability to measure the spectrum of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane.[91] By implication the outer envelope of η Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with η Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.[92]

Distance[edit]
The distance to η Carinae has been determined by several different methods, resulting in a widely accepted value of 2,330 parsecs (7,600 light-years), with a margin of error around 100 parsecs (330 light-years).[93] The distance to η Carinae itself cannot be measured using parallax due to its surrounding nebulosity, but other stars in the Trumpler 16 cluster are expected to be at a similar distance and are accessible to parallax. Gaia Data Release 2 has provided the parallax for many stars considered to be members of Trumpler 16, finding that the four hottest O-class stars in the region have very similar parallaxes with a mean value of 0.383±0.017 milliarcseconds (mas), which translates to a distance of 2,600±100 parsecs. This implies that η Carinae may be more distant than previously thought, and also more luminous, although it is still possible that it is not at the same distance as the cluster or that the parallax measurements have large systematic errors.[94]
The distances to star clusters can be estimated by using a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or colour–colour diagram to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of the stars, for example fitting the main sequence or identifying features such as a horizontal branch, and hence their distance from Earth. It is also necessary to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula.[95] A distance of 7,330 light-years (2,250 parsecs) has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16.[96] After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at 9,500±1,000 light-years (2,900±300 parsecs).[97]
The known expansion rate of the Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the projection of the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250, and 2,300 parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and η Carinae is clearly at the same distance.[93]

Properties[edit]
X-ray, optical and infrared images of η Carinae (26 August 2014)
The η Carinae star system is currently one of the most massive stars that can be studied in great detail. Until recently η Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996[9] and confirmed in 2005.[98] Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from η Carinae A, and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed when dust from the great eruption finally clears.[99]

Orbit[edit]
Eta Carinae orbit
The binary nature of η Carinae is clearly established, although the components have not been directly observed and cannot even be clearly resolved spectroscopically due to scattering and re-excitation in the surrounding nebulosity. Periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations prompted the search for a companion, and modelling of the colliding winds and partial ""eclipses"" of some spectroscopic features have constrained the possible orbits.[14]
The period of the orbit is accurately known at 5.539 years, although this has changed over time due to mass loss and accretion. Between the Great Eruption and the smaller 1890 eruption, the orbital period was apparently 5.52 years, while before the Great Eruption it may have been lower still, possibly between 4.8 and 5.4 years.[16] The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a semi-major axis of 15–16 AU. The orbit is highly eccentric,   e = 0.9 . This means that the separation of the stars varies from around 1.6 AU, similar to the distance of Mars from the Sun, to 30 AU, similar to the distance of Neptune.[14]
Perhaps the most valuable use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of η Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.[14]

Classification[edit]
η Carinae A is classified as a luminous blue variable (LBV) due to the distinctive spectral and brightness variations. This type of variable star is characterised by irregular changes from a high temperature quiescent state to a low temperature outburst state at roughly constant luminosity. LBVs in the quiescent state lie on a narrow S Doradus instability strip, with more luminous stars being hotter. In outburst all LBVs have about the same temperature, which is near 8,000 K. LBVs in a normal outburst are visually brighter than when quiescent although the bolometric luminosity is unchanged.
An event similar to η Carinae A's Great Eruption has been observed in only one other star in the Milky Way — P Cygni — and in a handful of other possible LBVs in other galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as η Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.[8]
η Carinae A is not a typical LBV. It is more luminous than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although it is unclear what the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst, with a middle-G spectral type. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and it has been estimated that the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind, forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000–10,000 K.[18][21][33]
η Carinae B is a massive luminous hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral lines that ought not to be produced by the primary, η Carinae B is thought to be a young O-type star. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.[98]

Mass[edit]
The masses of stars are difficult to measure except by determination of a binary orbit. η Carinae is a binary system, but certain key information about the orbit is not known accurately. The mass can be strongly constrained to be greater than 90 M☉, due to the high luminosity.[18] Standard models of the system assume masses of 100–120 M☉[16][100][101] and 30–60 M☉[16] for the primary and secondary, respectively. Higher masses have been suggested, to model the energy output and mass transfer of the Great Eruption, with a combined system mass of over 250 M☉ before the Great Eruption.[16] η Carinae A has clearly lost a great deal of mass since it formed, and it is thought that it was initially 150–250 M☉, although it may have formed through binary merger.[102][103] Masses of 200 M☉ for the primary and 90 M☉ for the secondary best-fit one-mass-transfer model of the Great Eruption event.[16]

Mass loss[edit]
The Carina Nebula. η Carinae is the brightest star, on the left side.
Mass loss is one of the most intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, calculated mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution do not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. η Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around 10−3 M☉/year, and is an obvious candidate for study.[104]
η Carinae A is losing a lot of mass due to its extreme luminosity and relatively low surface gravity. Its stellar wind is entirely opaque and appears as a pseudo-photosphere; this optically dense surface hides any true physical surface of the star that may be present. (At extreme rates of radiative mass loss, the density gradient of lofted material may become continuous enough that a meaningfully discrete physical surface may not exist.) During the Great Eruption the mass loss rate was a thousand times higher, around 1 M☉/year sustained for ten years or more. The total mass loss during the eruption was at least 10–20 M☉ with much of it now forming the Homunculus Nebula. The smaller 1890 eruption produced the Little Homunculus Nebula, much smaller and only about 0.1 M☉.[17] The bulk of the mass loss occurs in a wind with a terminal velocity of about 420 km/s, but some material is seen at higher velocities, up to 3,200 km/s, possibly material blown from the accretion disk by the secondary star.[105]
η Carinae B is presumably also losing mass via a thin, fast stellar wind, but this cannot be detected directly. Models of the radiation observed from interactions between the winds of the two stars show a mass loss rate of the order of 10−5 M☉/year at speeds of 3,000 km/s, typical of a hot O-class star.[75] For a portion of the highly eccentric orbit, it may actually gain material from the primary via an accretion disk. During the Great Eruption of the primary, the secondary could have accreted several M☉, producing strong jets which formed the bipolar shape of the Homunculus Nebula.[104]

Luminosity[edit]
The stars of the η Carinae system are completely obscured by dust and opaque stellar winds, with much of the ultraviolet and visual radiation shifted to infrared. The total electromagnetic radiation across all wavelengths for both stars combined is several million solar luminosities (L☉).[21] The best estimate for the luminosity of the primary is 5 million L☉ making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. The luminosity of η Carinae B is particularly uncertain, probably several hundred thousand L☉ and almost certainly no more than 1 million L☉.
The most notable feature of η Carinae is its giant eruption or supernova impostor event, which originated in the primary star and was observed around 1843. In a few years, it produced almost as much visible light as a faint supernova explosion, but the star survived. It is estimated that at peak brightness the luminosity was as high as 50 million L☉.[8] Other supernova impostors have been seen in other galaxies, for example the possible false supernova SN 1961V in NGC 1058[106] and SN 2006jc's pre-explosion outburst in UGC 4904.[107]
Following the Great Eruption, η Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, resulting in dramatic reddening. This has been estimated at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified.[108] η Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening is considered to be largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.[99]

Temperature[edit]
Hubble image of the Homunculus Nebula; inset is a VLT NACO infrared image of η Carinae.
Until late in the 20th century, the temperature of η Carinae was assumed to be over 30,000 K because of the presence of high-excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this.[109] It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.
The powerful stellar winds from the two stars collide in a roughly conical WWC zone and produce temperatures as high as 100 MK at the apex between the two stars. This zone is the source of the hard X-rays and gamma rays close to the stars. Near periastron, as the secondary ploughs through ever denser regions of the primary wind, the colliding wind zone becomes distorted into a spiral trailing behind η Carinae B.[110]
The wind-wind collision cone separates the winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from η Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that are unlikely to be produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000 K and 41,000 K.[6]
In all other directions on the other side of the wind-wind collision zone, there is the wind from η Carinae A, cooler and around 100 times denser than η Carinae B's wind. It is also optically dense, completely obscuring anything resembling a true photosphere and rendering any definition of its temperature moot. The observable radiation originates from a pseudo-photosphere where the optical density of the wind drops to near zero, typically measured at a particular Rossland opacity value such as 2⁄3. This pseudo-photosphere is observed to be elongated and hotter along the presumed axis of rotation.[111]
η Carinae A is likely to have appeared as an early B hypergiant with a temperature of between 20,000 K and 25,000 K at the time of its discovery by Halley. An effective temperature determined for the surface of a spherical optically thick wind at several hundred R☉ would be 9,400–15,000 K, while the temperature of a theoretical 60 R☉ hydrostatic ""core"" at optical depth 150 would be 35,200 K.[21][43][99][112] The effective temperature of the visible outer edge of the opaque primary wind is generally treated as being 15,000–25,000 K on the basis of visual and ultraviolet spectral features assumed to be directly from the wind or reflected via the Weigelt Blobs.[8][17] During the great eruption, η Carinae A was much cooler at around 5,000 K.[55]
The Homunculus contains dust at temperatures varying from 150 K to 400 K. This is the source of almost all the infrared radiation that makes η Carinae such a bright object at those wavelengths.[8]
Further out, expanding gases from the Great Eruption collide with interstellar material and are heated to around 5 MK, producing less energetic X-rays seen in a horseshoe or ring shape.[113][114]

Size[edit]
The size of the two main stars in the η Carinae system is difficult to determine precisely, for neither star can be seen directly. η Carinae B is likely to have a well-defined photosphere, and its radius can be estimated from the assumed type of star. An O supergiant of 933,000 L☉ with a temperature of 37,200 K has an effective radius of 23.6 R☉.[5]
The size of η Carinae A is not even well defined. It has an optically dense stellar wind, so the typical definition of a star's surface being approximately where it becomes opaque gives a very different result to where a more traditional definition of a surface might be. One study calculated a radius of 60 R☉ for a hot ""core"" of 35,000 K at optical depth 150, near the sonic point or very approximately what might be called a physical surface. At optical depth 0.67 the radius would be over 800 R☉, indicating an extended optically thick stellar wind.[18] At the peak of the Great Eruption the radius, so far as such a thing is meaningful during such a violent expulsion of material, would have been around 1,400 R☉, comparable to the largest-known red supergiants, including VY Canis Majoris.[115]
The stellar sizes should be compared with their orbital separation, which is only around 250 R☉ at periastron. The accretion radius of the secondary is around 60 R☉, suggesting strong accretion near periastron leading to a collapse of the secondary wind.[16] It has been proposed that the initial brightening from 4th magnitude to 1st at relatively constant bolometric luminosity was a normal LBV outburst, albeit from an extreme example of the class. Then the companion star passing through the expanded photosphere of the primary at periastron triggered the further brightening, increase in luminosity, and extreme mass loss of the Great Eruption.[115]

Rotation[edit]
Rotation rates of massive stars have a critical influence on their evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the η Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single massive stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both η Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.[92]

Eruptions[edit]
Hubble Space Telescope image showing the bipolar Homunculus Nebula which surrounds Eta Carinae
Two eruptions have been observed from η Carinae, the Great Eruption of the mid-19th century and the Lesser Eruption of 1890. In addition, studies of outlying nebulosity suggest at least one earlier eruption around 1250 CE. A further eruption may have occurred around 1550 CE, although it is possible that the material indicating this eruption is actually from the Great Eruption slowed down by colliding with older nebulosity.[116] The mechanism producing these eruptions is unknown. It is not even clear whether the eruptions involve explosive events or so-called super-Eddington winds, an extreme form of stellar wind involving very high mass loss induced by an increase in the luminosity of the star. The energy source for the explosions or luminosity increase is also unknown.[117]
Theories about the various eruptions must account for: repeating events, at least three eruptions of various sizes; ejecting 20 M☉ or more without destroying the star; the highly unusual shape and expansion rates of the ejected material; and the light curve during the eruptions involving a brightness increases of several magnitudes over a period of decades. The best-studied event is the Great Eruption. As well as photometry during the 19th century, light echoes observed in the 21st century give further information about the progression of the eruption, showing a brightening with multiple peaks for approximately 20 years, followed by a plateau period in the 1850s. The light echoes show that the outflow of material during the plateau phase was much higher than before the peak of the eruption.[117] Possible explanations for the eruptions include: a binary merger in what was then a triple system;[118] mass transfer from η Carinae B during periastron passages;[16] or a pulsational pair-instability explosion.[117]

Evolution[edit]
The recent light curve of η Carinae, with observations at standard wavelengths marked
η Carinae is a unique object, with no very close analogues currently known in any galaxy. Therefore, its future evolution is highly uncertain, but almost certainly involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova.[119]
η Carinae A would have begun life as an extremely hot star on the main sequence, already a highly luminous object over a million L☉. The exact properties would depend on the initial mass, which is expected to have been at least 150 M☉ and possibly much higher. A typical spectrum when first formed would be O2If and the star would be mostly or fully convective due to CNO cycle fusion at the very high core temperatures. Sufficiently massive or differentially rotating stars undergo such strong mixing that they remain chemically homogeneous during core hydrogen burning.[82]
As core hydrogen burning progresses, a very massive star would slowly expand and become more luminous, becoming a blue hypergiant and eventually an LBV while still fusing hydrogen in the core. When hydrogen at the core is depleted after 2–2.5 million years, hydrogen shell burning continues with further increases in size and luminosity, although hydrogen shell burning in chemically homogeneous stars may be very brief or absent since the entire star would become depleted of hydrogen. In the late stages of hydrogen burning, mass loss is extremely high due to the high luminosity and enhanced surface abundances of helium and nitrogen. As hydrogen burning ends and core helium burning begins, massive stars transition very rapidly to the Wolf–Rayet stage with little or no hydrogen, increased temperatures and decreased luminosity. They are likely to have lost over half their initial mass at this point.[120]
It is unclear whether triple-alpha helium fusion has started at the core of η Carinae A. The elemental abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% hydrogen and 40% helium, with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels. This is indicative of ongoing CNO cycle hydrogen fusion.[121]
Models of the evolution and death of single very massive stars predict an increase in temperature during helium core burning, with the outer layers of the star being lost. It becomes a Wolf–Rayet star on the nitrogen sequence, moving from WNL to WNE as more of the outer layers are lost, possibly reaching the WC or WO spectral class as carbon and oxygen from the triple alpha process reach the surface. This process would continue with heavier elements being fused until an iron core develops, at which point the core collapses and the star is destroyed. Subtle differences in initial conditions, in the models themselves, and most especially in the rates of mass loss, produce different predictions for the final state of the most massive stars. They may survive to become a helium-stripped star or they may collapse at an earlier stage while they retain more of their outer layers.[122][123][124] The lack of sufficiently luminous WN stars and the discovery of apparent LBV supernova progenitors has also prompted the suggestion that certain types of LBVs explode as a supernova without evolving further.[125]
η Carinae is a close binary and this complicates the evolution of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars much more quickly than would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary.[126] In the case of η Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.

Potential supernova[edit]
Supernovae types depending on initial mass and metallicity
The overwhelming probability is that the next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even visible to the naked eye.[127] Nevertheless, the prospect of a supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well studied as η Carinae arouses great interest.[128]
As a single star, a star originally around 150 times as massive as the Sun would typically reach core collapse as a Wolf–Rayet star within 3 million years.[122] At low metallicity, many massive stars will collapse directly to a black hole with no visible explosion or a sub-luminous supernova, and a small fraction will produce a pair-instability supernova, but at solar metallicity and above, there is expected to be sufficient mass loss before collapse to allow a visible supernova of type Ib or Ic.[129] If there is still a large amount of expelled material close to the star, the shock formed by the supernova explosion impacting the circumstellar material can efficiently convert kinetic energy to radiation, resulting in a superluminous supernova (SLSN) or hypernova, several times more luminous than a typical core collapse supernova and much longer-lasting. Highly massive progenitors may also eject sufficient nickel to cause a SLSN simply from the radioactive decay.[130] The resulting remnant would be a black hole, for it is highly unlikely such a massive star could ever lose sufficient mass for its core not to exceed the limit for a neutron star.[131]
The existence of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If η Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, it might be a less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova due to the lack of hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma-ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.[122][126][132]
Several unusual supernovae and impostors have been compared to η Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to η Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 which is likely to have been a true supernova.[133] SN 2006jc, some 77 million light-years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. η Carinae has also been compared to other possible supernova impostors such as SN 1961V and iPTF14hls, and to superluminous supernovae such as SN 2006gy.

Possible effects on Earth[edit]
One theory of η Carinae's ultimate fate is collapsing to form a black hole—energy released as jets along the axis of rotation forms gamma-ray bursts.
A typical core collapse supernova at the distance of η Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star it is unlikely to directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites and any astronauts in space.
At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a nearby supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun, but this would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than η Carinae.[134] Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than η Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.[135]
η Carinae is not expected to produce a gamma-ray burst, and its axis is not currently aimed near Earth.[135] The Earth's atmosphere protects its inhabitants from all the radiation apart from UV light (it is opaque to gamma rays, which have to be observed using space telescopes). The main effect would result from damage to the ozone layer. η Carinae is too far away to do that even if it did produce a gamma-ray burst.[136][137]
