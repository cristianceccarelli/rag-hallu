What is the Kyoto School?,"The Kyoto School, also known as the Kyoto-Gakuen School or the Kyoto School of Economics and Management, was a group of Japanese economists who emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. The school was named after the city of Kyoto, where many of its members studied and taught. The Kyoto School was characterized by its emphasis on microeconomic theory and its rejection of Keynesian economics and other mainstream macroeconomic theories.

The members of the Kyoto School included a number of prominent Japanese economists, such as:

* Haruhiko Kuroda (1924-2016)
* Masaru Imai (1932-2010)
* Akira Kubo (1925-2014)
* Hirofumi Koyama (1926-2011)
* Kenzo Nakamura (1925-2019)
* Nobuo Okishio (1924-2011)
* Yoshio Ohtsuka (1925-2012)
* Shigeru Ono (1924-2015)
* Yoshiki Toda (1939-2015)
* Akira Watanabe (1925-2011)

The Kyoto School was notable for its emphasis on empirical research and its rejection of mainstream macroeconomic theories, such as Keynesian economics. The school's members developed a number of influential theories and models, such as the New Keynesian Phillips Curve and the Okun's Law, which continue to be widely used in modern economics. The Kyoto School also played a significant role in the development of the Japanese economy, with many of its members holding prominent positions in the government and private sector.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_School,"

The Kyoto School (京都学派, Kyōto-gakuha) is the name given to the Japanese philosophical movement centered at Kyoto University that assimilated Western philosophy and religious ideas and used them to reformulate religious and moral insights unique to the East Asian philosophical tradition.[1] However, it is also used to describe postwar scholars who have taught at the same university, been influenced by the foundational thinkers of Kyoto school philosophy, and who have developed distinctive theories of Japanese uniqueness. To disambiguate the term, therefore, thinkers and writers covered by this second sense appear under The Kyoto University Research Centre for the Cultural Sciences.
Beginning roughly in 1913 with Kitarō Nishida, it survived the serious controversy it garnered after World War II to develop into a well-known and active movement. However, it is not a ""school"" of philosophy in the traditional sense of the phrase, such as with the Frankfurt School or Plato's Academy. Instead, the group of academics gathered around Kyoto University as a de facto meeting place. Its founder, Nishida, steadfastly encouraged independent thinking.
According to James Heisig, the name ""Kyoto School"" was first used in 1932 by a student of Nishida and Hajime Tanabe. Jun Tosaka considered himself to be part of the 'Marxist left-wing' of the school.[2] Afterwards, the media and academic institutions outside Japan began to use the term. By the 1970s it had become a universally accepted term.


History[edit]
Masao Abe writes in his introduction to a new English translation of Nishida's magnum opus that if one thinks of philosophy in terms of Kant or Hegel, then there is no philosophy taking place in Japan. But if it is instead thought of in the tradition carried out by Augustine and Kierkegaard, then Japan has a rich philosophical history, composed of the great thinkers Kūkai, Shinran, Dōgen, and others.[3]
The group of philosophers involved with the Kyoto School in its nearly 100-year history is a diverse one. Members often come from very different social backgrounds. At the same time, in the heat of intellectual debate they did not hesitate to criticise each other's work.
The following criteria roughly characterize the features of this school:

Teaching at Kyoto University or at a nearby affiliated school.
Sharing some basic assumptions about using Asian thought in the framework of Western philosophical tradition.
Introducing and rationally investigating the meaning of ""nothingness"" and its importance in the history of philosophical debate.
Expanding on the philosophical vocabulary introduced by Nishida.
Generally, most were strongly influenced by the German philosophical tradition, especially the thought of Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. In addition, many employed their cultural resources in formulating their philosophy and bringing it to play to add to the philosophical enterprise.
While their work was not expressly religious it was informed significantly by it. For example, Tanabe and Keiji Nishitani wrote on Christianity and Buddhism and identified common elements between the religions.[4] For this reason, some scholars classify the intellectual products of the school as ""religious philosophy.""
Although the group was fluid and largely informal, traditionally whoever occupied the Chair of the Department of Modern Philosophy at the University of Kyoto was considered its leader. Nishida was the first, from 1913 to 1928. Hajime Tanabe succeeded him until the mid-1930s. By this time, Nishitani had graduated from Kyoto University, studied with Martin Heidegger for two years in Germany, and returned to a teaching post since 1928. From 1955 to 1963, Nishitani officially occupied the Chair. Since his departure, leadership of the school crumbled — turning the movement into a very decentralized group of philosophers with common beliefs and interests.

Significance of its notable members[edit]
The significance of the group continues to grow, especially in American departments of religion and philosophy. Since the mid-1980s, there has been a growing interest in East/West dialogue, especially inter-faith scholarship. Masao Abe traveled to both coasts of the United States on professorships and lectured to many groups on Buddhist-Christian relations.
Although Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki was closely connected to the Kyoto School and in some ways critical to the development of thought that occurred there — he personally knew Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani — he is not considered a true member of the group.[5]

Kitaro Nishida[edit]
Main article: Kitaro Nishida
Kitaro Nishida, the school's founder, is most known for his groundbreaking work An Inquiry into the Good and later for his elucidation of the ""logic of basho"" (Japanese: 場所; usually translated as ""place,"" or the Greek τόπος topos). This brought him fame outside Japan and contributed largely to the attention later paid to philosophers from the Kyoto School.
Nishida's work is notable for a few reasons. Chief among them is how much they are related to the German tradition of philosophy since Schopenhauer. The logic of basho is a non-dualistic 'concrete' logic, meant to overcome the inadequacy of the subject-object distinction essential to the subject logic of Aristotle and the predicate logic of Kant, through the affirmation of what he calls the 'absolutely contradictory self-identity' — a dynamic tension of opposites that, unlike the dialectical logic of Hegel, does not resolve in a synthesis. Rather, it defines its proper subject by maintaining the tension between affirmation and negation as opposite poles or perspectives.
Nishitani describes East Asian philosophy as something very different from what the Western tradition of Descartes, Leibniz or Hume would indicate.

It is 'intuitive and practical,' with its emphasis on religious aspects of experience not lending themselves readily to theoretical description. True wisdom is to be distinguished from intellectual understanding of the kind appropriate to the sciences. The 'appropriation' of Nishida's thought,...'embraces difficulties entirely different from those of intellectual understanding'...and those who 'pretend to understand much but do not really understand, no matter how much they intellectually understand' are the object of his scorn.[1]
Nishida wrote The Logic of Place and the Religious Worldview, developing more fully the religious implications of his work and philosophy through ""Absolute Nothingness,"" which ""contains its own absolute self-negation within itself.""[6] By this Nishida means that while the divine is dynamically paradoxical, it should not be construed as pantheism or transcendent theism.
Nishitani and Abe spent much of their academic lives dedicated to this development of nothingness and the Absolute, leading on occasion to panentheism.[citation needed]

Hajime Tanabe[edit]

Keiji Nishitani[edit]
Main article: Keiji Nishitani
Keiji Nishitani, one of Nishida's main disciples, became the doyen in the post-war period. Nishitani's works, such as his Religion and Nothingness, primarily dealt with the Western notion of nihilism, inherited from Nietzsche, and religious interpretation of nothingness, as found in the Buddhist idea of sunyata and the specifically Zen Buddhist concept of mu.

Criticism[edit]
Today, there is a great deal of critical research into the school's role before and during the Second World War.
Hajime Tanabe bears the greatest brunt of the criticism for bringing his work on the ""Logic of Species"" into Japanese politics, which was used to buttress the militarist project to formulate imperialist ideology and propaganda. Tanabe's notion is that the logical category of ""species"" and nation are equivalent, and each nation or ""species"" provides a fundamental set of characteristics which define and determine the lives and outlooks of those who participate in it.

The Quad in the Indo-Pacific: What to Know

The Quad, composed of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, is not a formal alliance. Still, the group has intensified its security and economic ties as tensions with China rise.








What does the Quad do?
The Quad, officially the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is a group of four countries: the United States, Australia, India, and Japan. Maritime cooperation among them began after the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. But today the countries—all democracies and vibrant economies—work on a far broader agenda, which includes tackling security, economic, and health issues.

Over the years, the Quad’s diplomacy has waxed and waned. It is a loose grouping rather than a formal alliance. Japan initially emphasized the democratic identity of the four nations, whereas India seemed more comfortable emphasizing functional cooperation. Australian leaders have been reluctant about creating the impression that the group is a formal alliance.

As of 2021, leaders in all four countries have become more aligned in their shared concerns about China’s increasingly assertive behavior in the region and are more willing to define a constructive agenda of cooperation. All four navies participated in their first joint exercise in over a decade in November 2020. And in March 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden convened a virtual Quad meeting attended by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. They formed working groups on COVID-19 vaccines, climate change, and technological innovation and supply-chain resilience.

Working closely with these countries is natural for the United States. Australia and Japan are U.S. treaty allies, and India is an important strategic partner. The Donald Trump administration worked closely with these countries, and the Biden administration is expanding the Quad’s agenda.
The Indo-Pacific spans two oceans and several continents, making it important to U.S. maritime interests. In 2019, $1.9 trillion [PDF] worth of U.S. trade passed through the region. This year, 42 percent of the world’s exports and 38 percent of global imports are expected to pass through, according to a UN report.

China’s growing willingness to challenge the regional status quo worries Washington, and Beijing’s challenging of democratic values over the past year has deepened other Quad partners’ concerns as well. China’s pursuit of its regional interests—including its crackdown on Hong Kong’s freedoms and criticism of nations that take issue with its actions—has not been slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Quad’s agenda is not all about China. Leaders of the four nations also see a need for a more proactive approach to solving humanitarian and economic challenges caused by COVID-19.
What are Japan’s aims for the Quad?
Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was a strong believer in the Quad’s power to ensure a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” Abe worked to persuade the Trump administration of the value of this coalition approach across the Indo-Pacific. 
Japan depends heavily on open sea lanes for its trade with the world. The U.S. and Japanese militaries already work closely across the region, and Japan’s Self-Defense Forces have slowly built relationships [PDF] with their Australian and Indian counterparts. Similarly, Japan has played an important role in supporting investment [PDF] in manufacturing, trade, and infrastructure development across the region.

Japan and its Quad partners share concerns about China’s role in the region and Beijing’s challenges to the rule of law. Beijing’s assertion of its sovereignty in the South China Sea, as well as Chinese provocations toward islands China and Japan both claim in the East China Sea, has made Tokyo wary of China’s military build-up. Strategic consultations with other Quad partners are vital.
Similarly, Japan is watching carefully as China imposes economic conditionality on countries in the Indo-Pacific, and it wants to offer Southeast Asian countries alternative sources of assistance and commerce to offset China’s growing influence. Tokyo has joined with Washington and Canberra to deepen the funds available for quality infrastructure. Bolstering the resilience of the Quad nations, especially for critical supply chains for goods such as semiconductors, will also be a Japanese priority.
How has China responded?
China’s relations with each of the Quad members have become more tense during the pandemic. U.S.-China tensions remain high; Beijing’s frustration was conspicuous when the new Biden foreign policy team had its first meeting with its Chinese counterpart in Alaska in March. Australia continues to bear the brunt of Chinese economic sanctions after suggesting a World Health Organization investigation into the origins of COVID-19 last year. India and Japan have clashed with China over territorial disputes. China’s ambassador to Tokyo has publicly criticized Prime Minister Suga, claiming that the new Quad diplomacy reflects a “Cold War mentality” and that it is “100 percent outdated.” In addition, recent polls have shown negative views of China have soared among publics across the region.
Yet, few policymakers in the Quad countries see an advantage in trying to contain Chinese influence militarily. Instead, the Quad leaders have emphasized cooperation across areas of shared interest to bolster confidence in the democracies’ ability to counter China’s assertion of regional influence. As long as tensions with China remain, the Quad’s agenda is likely to expand as the democracies of the Indo-Pacific seek to balance China’s growing power.

Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir (UK: /də ˈboʊvwɑːr/, US: /də boʊˈvwɑːr/;[2][3] French: [simɔn də bovwaʁ] ⓘ; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French existentialist philosopher, writer, social theorist, and feminist activist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, nor was she considered one at the time of her death,[4][5][6] she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.[7]
Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, short stories, biographies, autobiographies, and monographs on philosophy, politics, and social issues. She was best known for her ""trailblazing work in feminist philosophy"",[8] The Second Sex (1949), a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism. She was also known for her novels, the most famous of which were She Came to Stay (1943) and The Mandarins (1954). 
Her most enduring contribution to literature are her memoirs, notably the first volume, Mémoires d'une jeune fille rangée[9] (1958).[10] She received the 1954 Prix Goncourt, the 1975 Jerusalem Prize, and the 1978 Austrian State Prize for European Literature. She was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961, 1969 and 1973.[11] However, Beauvoir generated controversy when she briefly lost her teaching job after being accused of sexually abusing some of her students.


Personal life[edit]
Early years[edit]
Beauvoir was born on 9 January 1908,[12] into a bourgeois Parisian family in the 6th arrondissement.[13][14][15] Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a lawyer who once aspired to be an actor,[16] and Françoise Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone had a sister, Hélène, who was born two years later, on June 6, 1910. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after World War I, and Françoise insisted the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school.
Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fueled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, ""Simone thinks like a man!""[17] Because of her family's straitened circumstances, she could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. She took this opportunity to take steps towards earning a living for herself.[18]
She first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Lévi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the École Normale Supérieure in preparation for the agrégation in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination that serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for it that she met École Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and René Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname ""Castor"", or ""beaver"").[16] The jury for the agrégation narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.[19] Additionally, Beauvoir finished an exam for the certificate of ""General Philosophy and Logic"" second to Simone Weil. Her success as the eighth woman to pass the agrégation solidified her economic independence and furthered her feminist ideology.[8]
Writing of her youth in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, she said:
""...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.""[20]

Education[edit]
Beauvoir pursued post-secondary education after completing her high school years at Cours Desir [fr].[21] After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy at the age of seventeen in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the Institut Sainte-Marie [fr]. She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, wrote her Diplôme d'Études Supérieures Spécialisées [fr] (roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis) on Leibniz for Léon Brunschvicg (the topic was ""Le concept chez Leibniz"" [""The Concept in Leibniz""]).[22] Her studies of political philosophy through university influenced her to start thinking of societal concerns.[citation needed]

Religious upbringing[edit]
Beauvoir was raised in a Catholic household. In her youth, she was sent to convent schools. She was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. At age 14, Beauvoir questioned her faith as she saw many changes in the world after witnessing tragedies throughout her life.[23] Consequently, she abandoned her faith in her early teens and remained an atheist for the rest of her life.[24] To explain her atheist beliefs, Beauvoir stated, ""Faith allows an evasion of those difficulties which the atheist confronts honestly. And to crown all, the believer derives a sense of great superiority from this very cowardice itself.""[25]

Middle years[edit]
Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at the Balzac Memorial
From 1929 through 1943, Beauvoir taught at the lycée level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the Lycée Montgrand [fr] (Marseille), the Lycée Jeanne-d'Arc (Rouen) [fr], and the Lycée Molière (Paris) [fr] (1936–39).[26]
During the trial of Robert Brasillach Beauvoir was among a small number of prominent intellectuals advocating for his execution for 'intellectual crimes'. She defended this decision in her 1946 essay ""An Eye for an Eye"".[27][28]

Jean-Paul Sartre[edit]
Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre met during her college years. Intrigued by her determination as an educator, he intended to make their relationship romantic. However, she had no interest in doing so.[23] She later changed her mind, and in October 1929, Jean-Paul Sartre and Beauvoir became a couple for the next 51 years, until his death in 1980.[29] After they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him on a provisional basis. One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, ""Let's sign a two-year lease"".[30] Though Beauvoir wrote, ""Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry"", scholars point out that her ideal relationships described in The Second Sex and elsewhere bore little resemblance to the marriage standards of the day.[31]

I think marriage is a very alienating institution, for men as well as for women. I think it's a very dangerous institution—dangerous for men, who find themselves trapped, saddled with a wife and children to support; dangerous for women, who aren't financially independent and end up by depending on men who can throw them out when they are 40; and very dangerous for children, because their parents vent all their frustrations and mutual hatred on them. The very words 'conjugal rights' are dreadful. Any institution which solders one person to another, obliging people to sleep together who no longer want to is a bad one.[32]

Instead, she and Sartre entered into a lifelong ""soul partnership"", which was sexual but not exclusive, nor did it involve living together.[33] She chose never to marry and never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, write and teach, and take lovers.[34] Unfortunately, Beauvoir's prominent open relationships at times overshadowed her substantial academic reputation. A scholar who was lecturing with her[35] chastised their ""distinguished [Harvard] audience [because] every question asked about Sartre concerned his work, while all those asked about Beauvoir concerned her personal life.""[36]
Sartre and Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's Being and Nothingness and Beauvoir's She Came to Stay and ""Phenomenology and Intent"".[37] However, recent studies of Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including Hegel and Leibniz.[7] The Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit.[38][39]  However, Beauvoir, reading Hegel in German during the war, produced an original critique of his dialectic of consciousness.

Allegations of sexual abuse[edit]
Beauvoir was bisexual, and her relationships with young women were controversial.[40] French author Bianca Lamblin (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée (Memoirs of a deranged girl, published in English under the title A Disgraceful Affair) that, while a student at Lycée Molière, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who was in her 30s.[41] Sartre and Beauvoir both groomed and sexually abused Lamblin.[42] Bianca wrote her Mémoires in response to the posthumous 1990 publication of Jean-Paul Sartre's Lettres au Castor et à quelques autres: 1926-1963 (Letters to Castor and other friends), in which she noted that she was referred to by the pseudonym Louise Védrine.[43]
In 1943, Beauvoir was suspended again from her teaching position when she was accused of seducing her 17-year-old lycée pupil Natalie Sorokine in 1939.[44] Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against Beauvoir for debauching a minor (the age of consent in France at the time was 13 until 1945, when it became 15)[45][46] and Beauvoir's licence to teach in France was revoked, although it was subsequently reinstated.[47]
Beauvoir described in La Force de l'âge (The Prime of Life) a relationship of simple friendship with Nathalie Sorokine[48] (in the book referred to as ""Lise Oblanoff"").[49] Sorokine, along with Bianca Lamblin and Olga Kosakiewicz, later stated that their relationships with Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.[40]

Later years[edit]
 Antonio Núñez Jiménez, Beauvoir, Sartre and Che Guevara in Cuba, 1960.
Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Beauvoir, Sartre and Claude Lanzmann in Cairo, 1967.
Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States[50] and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Her 1955 travels in China were the basis of her 1957 travelogue The Long March, in which she praised the efforts of the Chinese communists to emancipate women.[51]
She published several volumes of short stories, including The Woman Destroyed, which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.
She lived with Claude Lanzmann from 1952 to 1959,[52] but perhaps her most famous lover was American author Nelson Algren. Beauvoir met Algren in Chicago in 1947, while she was on a four-month ""exploration"" trip of the United States using various means of transport: automobile, train, and Greyhound. She kept a detailed diary of the trip, which was published in France in 1948 with the title America Day by Day.[53] She wrote to him across the Atlantic as ""my beloved husband.""[54] Algren won the National Book Award for The Man with the Golden Arm in 1950, and in 1954, Beauvoir won France's most prestigious literary prize for The Mandarins, in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan. Algren vociferously objected to their intimacy becoming public. Years after they separated, she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring.[55]

Algren in 1956
When Beauvoir visited Algren in Chicago, Art Shay took well-known nude and portrait photos of Beauvoir. Shay also wrote a play based on Algren, Beauvoir, and Sartre's triangular relationship. The play was stage read in 1999 in Chicago.
Beauvoir also wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, The Prime of Life, Force of Circumstance (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: After the War and Hard Times), and All Said and Done.[56] In 1964 Beauvoir published a novella-length autobiography, A Very Easy Death, covering the time she spent visiting her aging mother, who was dying of cancer. The novella brings up questions of ethical concerns with truth-telling in doctor-patient relationships.[57]
Her 1970 long essay La Vieillesse (The Coming of Age) is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.[58]
In the 1970s Beauvoir became active in France's women's liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Signatories were diverse[clarification needed] as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig, and Beauvoir's sister Hélène. In 1974, abortion was legalized in France.
When asked in a 1975 interview with Betty Friedan if she would support a minimum wage for women who do housework, Beauvoir answered: ""No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorized to stay at home and raise her children. Society should be different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction"", further stating that motherhood ""should be a choice, and not a result of conditioning”.[59][60]
In about 1976, Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit Kate Millett on her farm.[61][clarification needed]
In 1977, Beauvoir signed a petition along with other French intellectuals that supported the freeing of three arrested paedophiles.[62][63] The petition  explicitly addresses the 'Affaire de Versailles', where three adult men, Dejager (age 45), Gallien (age 43), and Burckhardt (age 39) had sexual relations with minors of both sexes aged 12–13.[64][65]
When Things of the Spirit Come First, a set of short stories Beauvoir had written decades previously but had not considered worth publishing, was released in 1980.[56]

Beauvoir's and Sartre's grave at the Cimetière du Montparnasse.
In 1981 she wrote La Cérémonie des adieux (A Farewell to Sartre), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of Adieux, Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.[citation needed]|
She contributed the piece ""Feminism - Alive, Well, and in Constant Danger"" to the 1984 anthology Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, edited by Robin Morgan.[66]
After Sartre died in 1980, Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon, unlike Elkaïm, published Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir[edit]
Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir and Simone de Beauvoir met in the 1960s, when Beauvoir was in her fifties and Sylvie was a teenager. In 1980, Beauvoir, 72, legally adopted Sylvie, who was in her late thirties, by which point they had already been in an intimate relationship for decades. Although Beauvoir rejected the institution of marriage her entire life, this adoption was like a marriage for her. Some scholars argue that this adoption was not to secure a literary heir for Beauvoir, but as a form of resistance to the bio-heteronormative family unit.[67]

Death[edit]
Beauvoir died of pneumonia on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78.[68] She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.[69] She was honored as a figure at the forefront of the struggle for women's rights around the time of her passing.[70]

The Second Sex[edit]
The Second SexThe Second Sex, first published in 1949 in French as Le Deuxième Sexe, turns the existentialist mantra that existence precedes essence into a feminist one: ""One is not born but becomes a woman"" (French: ""On ne naît pas femme, on le devient"").[71] With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the sex-gender distinction, that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes.[72] Beauvoir argues that ""the fundamental source of women's oppression is its [femininity's] historical and social construction as the quintessential"" Other.[73]
Beauvoir defines women as the ""second sex"" because women are defined as inferior to men. She pointed out that Aristotle argued women are ""female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities"", while Thomas Aquinas referred to women as ""imperfect men"" and the ""incidental"" being.[74] She quotes ""In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation.""[75]
Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the ""immanence"" to which they were previously resigned and reaching ""transcendence"", a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.[76]
Chapters of The Second Sex were originally published in Les Temps modernes,[77] in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France.[78] It was published soon after in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley, as prompted by Blanche Knopf, wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at Smith College), much of Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message.[79] For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.[79]
Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.[80]
In the chapter ""Woman: Myth and Reality"" of The Second Sex,[81] Beauvoir argued that men had made women the ""Other"" in society by the application of a false aura of ""mystery"" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class, and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a patriarchy.[citation needed]
Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist.[18] However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with Le Nouvel Observateur.[82]
In 2018, the manuscript pages of Le Deuxième Sexe were published.[83]

Other notable works[edit]
She Came to Stay[edit]
Main article: She Came to Stay
Beauvoir published her first novel She Came to Stay in 1943.[84] It has been assumed that it is inspired by her and Sartre's sexual relationship with Olga Kosakiewicz and Wanda Kosakiewicz. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a lover of Beauvoir. However, the main thrust of the novel is philosophical, a scene in which to situate Beauvoir's abiding philosophical pre-occupation – the relationship between the self and the other.[citation needed]
In the novel, set just before the outbreak of World War II, Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a ménage à trois with the young woman. The novel also delves into Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.[citation needed]
She Came to Stay was followed by many others, including The Blood of Others, which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the Resistance in World War II.[56]

Existentialist ethics[edit]
Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre in Beijing, 1955
In 1944, Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, Pyrrhus et Cinéas, a discussion on existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into French existentialism. In the essay, Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as Being and Nothingness. In The Ethics of Ambiguity, Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.[7]

Les Temps Modernes[edit]
Main article: Les Temps modernesAt the end of World War II, Beauvoir and Sartre edited Les Temps Modernes, a political journal that Sartre founded along with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others.[85] Beauvoir used Les Temps Modernes to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. Beauvoir remained an editor until her death. However, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave Les Temps modernes. Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force[clarification needed] to offer his opinions.[citation needed]
The Mandarins[edit]
Main article: The Mandarins
Dunes cottage where Algren and Beauvoir summered in Miller Beach, Indiana
Published in 1954, The Mandarins won France's highest literary prize, the Prix Goncourt.[86] It is a roman à clef set after the end of World War II and follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer Nelson Algren, to whom the book is dedicated.[87]
Algren was outraged by the frank way Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both The Mandarins and her autobiographies.[87] Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.[88]

Les Inséparables[edit]
Beauvoir's early novel Les Inséparables, long suppressed, was published in French in 2020 and two different English translations in 2021, by Sandra Smith in the US and Lauren Elkin in the UK.[89] Written in 1954, the book describes her first love, a classmate named Elisabeth Lacoin (""Zaza"") who died before age 22 of viral encephalitis, and had as a teenager a ""passionate and tragic"" relationship with Beauvoir and Merleau-Ponty, then teaching at the same school. According to Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir, Beauvoir never forgave Madame Lacoin for what happened, believing that Elisabeth-Zaza was murdered by the oppressive socio-cultural environment in which she had been raised.[90] Disapproved by Sartre, the novel was deemed ""too intimate"" to be published during Beauvoir's lifetime.

Legacy[edit]
Beauvoir's The Second Sex is considered a foundational work in the history of feminism. Beauvoir had denied being feminist multiple times but ultimately admitted that she was one after The Second Sex became crucial in the world of feminism.[70] The work has had a profound influence, opening the way for second-wave feminism in the United States, Canada, Australia, and around the world.[7] Although Beauvoir has been quoted as saying ""There is a certain unreasonable demand that I find a little stupid because it would enclose me, immobilize me completely in a sort of feminist concrete block,"" her works on feminism have paved the way for all future feminists.[91] The founders of the second-wave read The Second Sex in translation, including Kate Millett, Shulamith Firestone, Juliet Mitchell, Ann Oakley and Germaine Greer.  All acknowledged their profound debt to Beauvoir, including visiting her in France, consulting with her at crucial moments, and dedicating works to her.[92] Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often regarded as the opening salvo of second-wave feminism in the United States, later said that reading The Second Sex in the early 1950s[92] ""led me to whatever original analysis of women's existence I have been able to contribute to the Women's movement and its unique politics. I looked to Simone de Beauvoir for a philosophical and intellectual authority.""[93]
At one point in the early 1970s, Beauvoir also aligned herself with the French League for Women's Rights as a means to campaign and fight against sexism in French society.[91] Beauvoir's influence goes beyond just her impact on second-wave founders, and extends to numerous aspects of feminism, including literary criticism, history, philosophy, theology, criticism of scientific discourse, and psychotherapy.[7] When Beauvoir first became involved with the feminism movement, one of her objectives was legalizing abortion.[91] Donna Haraway wrote that, ""despite important differences, all the modern feminist meanings of gender have roots in Simone de Beauvoir's claim that 'one is not born a woman [one becomes one].'""[7] This ""most famous feminist sentence ever written""[94] is echoed in the title of Monique Wittig's 1981 essay One Is Not Born a Woman.[92][95][96] Judith Butler took the concept a step further, arguing that Beauvoir's choice of the verb to become suggests that gender is a process, constantly being renewed in an ongoing interaction between the surrounding culture and individual choice.[92][97]
In Paris, Place Jean-Paul-Sartre-et-Simone-de-Beauvoir is a square where Beauvoir's legacy lives on. It is one of the few squares in Paris to be officially named after a couple. The pair lived close to the square at 42 rue Bonaparte.

Surely if any sentence deserves a biography, or multiple biographies, it is this sentence that has inspired generations of women.

^ Butler 1990, p. 112  'One is not born a woman.' Monique Wittig echoed that phrase in an article by the same name, published in Feminist Issues (1:1).

Moreover, Beauvoir's use of the term 'becoming' leads Butler to wonder further that '...if gender is something that one becomes – but can never be – then gender itself is a kind of becoming or activity, and that gender ought not to be conceived as a noun or a substantial thing or a static cultural marker, but rather as an incessant and repeated action of some sort.' Butler (1990) p. 12.

What is Fermat's Last Theorem?,"Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous mathematical result named after Pierre de Fermat, a French mathematician who lived in the 17th century. Fermat is best known for his work in number theory, which is the study of integers and their properties. Fermat's Last Theorem states that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that:

a^n + b^n = c^n

for any integer value of n greater than 2. This theorem was first conjectured by Fermat in 1637, and he claimed to have a proof for it. However, his proof was never published and remained unknown until Andrew Wiles rediscovered it in the 20th century.

Fermat's Last Theorem has been one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics for over 300 years. It was finally proven in 1994 by Wiles, who used a combination of algebraic geometry and number theory to prove the theorem.

Fermat's Last Theorem has had a significant impact on mathematics, and it has inspired many other mathematicians to study number theory and other areas of mathematics. It has also been used as a tool to test the limits of human mathematical reasoning and to push the boundaries of mathematical knowledge.

Fermat's Last Theorem is still considered one of the most important mathematical results of the 20th century, and it has been recognized as one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics. It has also been used as a symbol of mathematical achievement and has been featured in popular culture, such as in the movie The Prestige, which is based on the life of Fermat.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem,"

Fermat's Last TheoremThe 1670 edition of Diophantus's Arithmetica includes Fermat's commentary, referred to as his ""Last Theorem"" (Observatio Domini Petri de Fermat), posthumously published by his son.FieldNumber theoryStatementFor any integer n > 2, the equation an + bn = cn has no positive integer solutions.First stated byPierre de FermatFirst stated inc. 1637First proof byAndrew WilesFirst proof inReleased 1994Published 1995Implied byEffective abc conjectureEffective modified Szpiro conjectureModularity theoremGeneralizationsBeal conjectureFermat–Catalan conjecture
In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions.[1]
The proposition was first stated as a theorem by Pierre de Fermat around 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica. Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. Although other statements claimed by Fermat without proof were subsequently proven by others and credited as theorems of Fermat (for example, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares), Fermat's Last Theorem resisted proof, leading to doubt that Fermat ever had a correct proof. Consequently, the proposition became known as a conjecture rather than a theorem. After 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles and formally published in 1995. It was described as a ""stunning advance"" in the citation for Wiles's Abel Prize award in 2016.[2] It also proved much of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, subsequently known as the modularity theorem, and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques.
The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""most difficult mathematical problem"", in part because the theorem has the largest number of unsuccessful proofs.[3]


Overview[edit]
Pythagorean origins[edit]
The Pythagorean equation, x2 + y2 = z2, has an infinite number of positive integer solutions for x, y, and z; these solutions are known as Pythagorean triples (with the simplest example being 3, 4, 5). Around 1637, Fermat wrote in the margin of a book that the more general equation an + bn = cn had no solutions in positive integers if n is an integer greater than 2. Although he claimed to have a general proof of his conjecture, Fermat left no details of his proof, and none has ever been found. His claim was discovered some 30 years later, after his death. This claim, which came to be known as Fermat's Last Theorem, stood unsolved for the next three and a half centuries.[4]
The claim eventually became one of the most notable unsolved problems of mathematics. Attempts to prove it prompted substantial development in number theory, and over time Fermat's Last Theorem gained prominence as an unsolved problem in mathematics.

Subsequent developments and solution[edit]

The special case n = 4, proved by Fermat himself, is sufficient to establish that if the theorem is false for some exponent n that is not a prime number, it must also be false for some smaller n, so only prime values of n need further investigation.[note 1] Over the next two centuries (1637–1839), the conjecture was proved for only the primes 3, 5, and 7, although Sophie Germain innovated and proved an approach that was relevant to an entire class of primes. In the mid-19th century, Ernst Kummer extended this and proved the theorem for all regular primes, leaving irregular primes to be analyzed individually. Building on Kummer's work and using sophisticated computer studies, other mathematicians were able to extend the proof to cover all prime exponents up to four million,[5] but a proof for all exponents was inaccessible (meaning that mathematicians generally considered a proof impossible, exceedingly difficult, or unachievable with current knowledge).[6]
Separately, around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama suspected a link might exist between elliptic curves and modular forms, two completely different areas of mathematics. Known at the time as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (eventually as the modularity theorem), it stood on its own, with no apparent connection to Fermat's Last Theorem. It was widely seen as significant and important in its own right, but was (like Fermat's theorem) widely considered completely inaccessible to proof.[7]
In 1984, Gerhard Frey noticed an apparent link between these two previously unrelated and unsolved problems. An outline suggesting this could be proved was given by Frey. The full proof that the two problems were closely linked was accomplished in 1986 by Ken Ribet, building on a partial proof by Jean-Pierre Serre, who proved all but one part known as the ""epsilon conjecture"" (see: Ribet's Theorem and Frey curve).[2] These papers by Frey, Serre and Ribet showed that if the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture could be proven for at least the semi-stable class of elliptic curves, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem would also follow automatically. The connection is described below: any solution that could contradict Fermat's Last Theorem could also be used to contradict the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture. So if the modularity theorem were found to be true, then by definition, no solution contradicting Fermat's Last Theorem could exist, meaning that Fermat's Last Theorem must also be true.
Although both problems were daunting and widely considered to be ""completely inaccessible"" to proof at the time,[2] this was the first suggestion of a route by which Fermat's Last Theorem could be extended and proved for all numbers, not just some numbers. Unlike Fermat's Last Theorem, the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture was a major active research area and viewed as more within reach of contemporary mathematics.[8] However, general opinion was that this simply showed the impracticality of proving the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture.[9] Mathematician John Coates' quoted reaction was a common one:[9]

I myself was very sceptical that the beautiful link between Fermat's Last Theorem and the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture would actually lead to anything, because I must confess I did not think that the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture was accessible to proof. Beautiful though this problem was, it seemed impossible to actually prove. I must confess I thought I probably wouldn't see it proved in my lifetime.
On hearing that Ribet had proven Frey's link to be correct, English mathematician Andrew Wiles, who had a childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem and had a background of working with elliptic curves and related fields, decided to try to prove the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture as a way to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. In 1993, after six years of working secretly on the problem, Wiles succeeded in proving enough of the conjecture to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles's paper was massive in size and scope. A flaw was discovered in one part of his original paper during peer review and required a further year and collaboration with a past student, Richard Taylor, to resolve. As a result, the final proof in 1995 was accompanied by a smaller joint paper showing that the fixed steps were valid. Wiles's achievement was reported widely in the popular press, and was popularized in books and television programs. The remaining parts of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture, now proven and known as the modularity theorem, were subsequently proved by other mathematicians, who built on Wiles's work between 1996 and 2001.[10][11][12] For his proof, Wiles was honoured and received numerous awards, including the 2016 Abel Prize.[13][14][15]

Equivalent statements of the theorem[edit]
There are several alternative ways to state Fermat's Last Theorem that are mathematically equivalent to the original statement of the problem.
In order to state them, we use the following notations: let N be the set of natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., let Z be the set of integers 0, ±1, ±2, ..., and let Q be the set of rational numbers a/b, where a and b are in Z with b ≠ 0. In what follows we will call a solution to xn + yn = zn where one or more of x, y, or z is zero a trivial solution. A solution where all three are nonzero will be called a non-trivial solution.
For comparison's sake we start with the original formulation.

Original statement. With n, x, y, z ∈ N (meaning that n, x, y, z are all positive whole numbers) and n > 2, the equation xn + yn = zn has no solutions.
Most popular treatments of the subject state it this way. It is also commonly stated over Z:[16]

Equivalent statement 1: xn + yn = zn, where integer n ≥ 3, has no non-trivial solutions x, y, z ∈ Z.
The equivalence is clear if n is even. If n is odd and all three of x, y, z are negative, then we can replace x, y, z with −x, −y, −z to obtain a solution in N. If two of them are negative, it must be x and z or y and z. If x, z are negative and y is positive, then we can rearrange to get (−z)n + yn = (−x)n resulting in a solution in N; the other case is dealt with analogously. Now if just one is negative, it must be x or y. If x is negative, and y and z are positive, then it can be rearranged to get (−x)n + zn = yn again resulting in a solution in N; if y is negative, the result follows symmetrically. Thus in all cases a nontrivial solution in Z would also mean a solution exists in N, the original formulation of the problem.

Equivalent statement 2: xn + yn = zn, where integer n ≥ 3, has no non-trivial solutions x, y, z ∈ Q.
This is because the exponents of x, y, and z are equal (to n), so if there is a solution in Q, then it can be multiplied through by an appropriate common denominator to get a solution in Z, and hence in N.

Equivalent statement 3: xn + yn = 1, where integer n ≥ 3, has no non-trivial solutions x, y ∈ Q.
A non-trivial solution a, b, c ∈ Z to xn + yn = zn yields the non-trivial solution a/c, b/c ∈ Q for vn + wn = 1. Conversely, a solution a/b, c/d ∈ Q to vn + wn = 1 yields the non-trivial solution ad, cb, bd for xn + yn = zn.
This last formulation is particularly fruitful, because it reduces the problem from a problem about surfaces in three dimensions to a problem about curves in two dimensions. Furthermore, it allows working over the field Q, rather than over the ring Z; fields exhibit more structure than rings, which allows for deeper analysis of their elements.

Equivalent statement 4 – connection to elliptic curves: If a, b, c is a non-trivial solution to ap + bp = cp, p odd prime, then y2 = x(x − ap)(x + bp) (Frey curve) will be an elliptic curve without a modular form.[17]
Examining this elliptic curve with Ribet's theorem shows that it does not have a modular form. However, the proof by Andrew Wiles proves that any equation of the form y2 = x(x − an)(x + bn) does have a modular form. Any non-trivial solution to xp + yp = zp (with p an odd prime) would therefore create a contradiction, which in turn proves that no non-trivial solutions exist.[18]
In other words, any solution that could contradict Fermat's Last Theorem could also be used to contradict the modularity theorem. So if the modularity theorem were found to be true, then it would follow that no contradiction to Fermat's Last Theorem could exist either. As described above, the discovery of this equivalent statement was crucial to the eventual solution of Fermat's Last Theorem, as it provided a means by which it could be ""attacked"" for all numbers at once.

Mathematical history[edit]
Pythagoras and Diophantus[edit]
Pythagorean triples[edit]
Main article: Pythagorean triple
In ancient times it was known that a triangle whose sides were in the ratio 3:4:5 would have a right angle as one of its angles. This was used in construction and later in early geometry. It was also known to be one example of a general rule that any triangle where the length of two sides, each squared and then added together (32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25), equals the square of the length of the third side (52 = 25), would also be a right angle triangle. This is now known as the Pythagorean theorem, and a triple of numbers that meets this condition is called a Pythagorean triple; both are named after the ancient Greek Pythagoras. Examples include (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13). There are infinitely many such triples,[19] and methods for generating such triples have been studied in many cultures, beginning with the Babylonians[20] and later ancient Greek, Chinese, and Indian mathematicians.[1] Mathematically, the definition of a Pythagorean triple is a set of three integers (a, b, c) that satisfy the equation[21] a2 + b2 = c2.

Diophantine equations[edit]
Main article: Diophantine equation
Fermat's equation, xn + yn = zn with positive integer solutions, is an example of a Diophantine equation,[22] named for the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician, Diophantus, who studied them and developed methods for the solution of some kinds of Diophantine equations. A typical Diophantine problem is to find two integers x and y such that their sum, and the sum of their squares, equal two given numbers A and B, respectively:





A
=
x
+
y


{\displaystyle A=x+y}






B
=

x

2


+

y

2


.


{\displaystyle B=x^{2}+y^{2}.}


Diophantus's major work is the Arithmetica, of which only a portion has survived.[23] Fermat's conjecture of his Last Theorem was inspired while reading a new edition of the Arithmetica,[24] that was translated into Latin and published in 1621 by Claude Bachet.[25][26]
Diophantine equations have been studied for thousands of years. For example, the solutions to the quadratic Diophantine equation x2 + y2 = z2 are given by the Pythagorean triples, originally solved by the Babylonians (c. 1800 BC).[27] Solutions to linear Diophantine equations, such as 26x + 65y = 13, may be found using the Euclidean algorithm (c. 5th century BC).[28]
Many Diophantine equations have a form similar to the equation of Fermat's Last Theorem from the point of view of algebra, in that they have no cross terms mixing two letters, without sharing its particular properties. For example, it is known that there are infinitely many positive integers x, y, and z such that xn + yn = zm, where n and m are relatively prime natural numbers.[note 2]

Fermat's conjecture[edit]
Problem II.8 in the 1621 edition of the Arithmetica of Diophantus. On the right is the margin that was too small to contain Fermat's alleged proof of his ""last theorem"".
Problem II.8 of the Arithmetica asks how a given square number is split into two other squares; in other words, for a given rational number k, find rational numbers u and v such that k2 = u2 + v2. Diophantus shows how to solve this sum-of-squares problem for k = 4 (the solutions being u = 16/5 and v = 12/5).[29]
Around 1637, Fermat wrote his Last Theorem in the margin of his copy of the Arithmetica next to Diophantus's sum-of-squares problem:[30][31][32]





Cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadratoquadratos & generaliter nullam in infinitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos eiusdem nominis fas est dividere cuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.




It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second, into two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.[33][34]



After Fermat's death in 1665, his son Clément-Samuel Fermat produced a new edition of the book (1670) augmented with his father's comments.[35] Although not actually a theorem at the time (meaning a mathematical statement for which proof exists), the marginal note became known over time as Fermat's Last Theorem,[30] as it was the last of Fermat's asserted theorems to remain unproved.[36][37]
It is not known whether Fermat had actually found a valid proof for all exponents n, but it appears unlikely. Only one related proof by him has survived, namely for the case n = 4, as described in the section § Proofs for specific exponents.
While Fermat posed the cases of n = 4 and of n = 3 as challenges to his mathematical correspondents, such as Marin Mersenne, Blaise Pascal, and John Wallis,[38] he never posed the general case.[39] Moreover, in the last thirty years of his life, Fermat never again wrote of his ""truly marvelous proof"" of the general case, and never published it. Van der Poorten[39] suggests that while the absence of a proof is insignificant, the lack of challenges means Fermat realised he did not have a proof; he quotes Weil[40] as saying Fermat must have briefly deluded himself with an irretrievable idea. The techniques Fermat might have used in such a ""marvelous proof"" are unknown.
Wiles and Taylor's proof relies on 20th-century techniques.[41] Fermat's proof would have had to be elementary by comparison, given the mathematical knowledge of his time.
While Harvey Friedman's grand conjecture implies that any provable theorem (including Fermat's last theorem) can be proved using only 'elementary function arithmetic', such a proof need be 'elementary' only in a technical sense and could involve millions of steps, and thus be far too long to have been Fermat's proof.

Proofs for specific exponents[edit]
Main article: Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for specific exponents
Fermat's infinite descent for Fermat's Last Theorem case n=4 in the 1670 edition of the Arithmetica of Diophantus (pp. 338–339).
Exponent = 4[edit]
Only one relevant proof by Fermat has survived, in which he uses the technique of infinite descent to show that the area of a right triangle with integer sides can never equal the square of an integer.[42][43][44] His proof is equivalent to demonstrating that the equation






x

4


−

y

4


=

z

2




{\displaystyle x^{4}-y^{4}=z^{2}}


has no primitive solutions in integers (no pairwise coprime solutions). In turn, this proves Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n = 4, since the equation a4 + b4 = c4 can be written as c4 − b4 = (a2)2.
Alternative proofs of the case n = 4 were developed later[45] by Frénicle de Bessy (1676),[46] Leonhard Euler (1738),[47] Kausler (1802),[48] Peter Barlow (1811),[49] Adrien-Marie Legendre (1830),[50] Schopis (1825),[51] Olry Terquem (1846),[52] Joseph Bertrand (1851),[53] Victor Lebesgue (1853, 1859, 1862),[54] Théophile Pépin (1883),[55] Tafelmacher (1893),[56] David Hilbert (1897),[57] Bendz (1901),[58] Gambioli (1901),[59] Leopold Kronecker (1901),[60] Bang (1905),[61] Sommer (1907),[62] Bottari (1908),[63] Karel Rychlík (1910),[64] Nutzhorn (1912),[65] Robert Carmichael (1913),[66] Hancock (1931),[67] Gheorghe Vrănceanu (1966),[68] Grant and Perella (1999),[69] Barbara (2007),[70] and Dolan (2011).[71]

Other exponents[edit]
After Fermat proved the special case n = 4, the general proof for all n required only that the theorem be established for all odd prime exponents.[72] In other words, it was necessary to prove only that the equation an + bn = cn has no positive integer solutions (a, b, c) when n is an odd prime number. This follows because a solution (a, b, c) for a given n is equivalent to a solution for all the factors of n. For illustration, let n be factored into d and e, n = de. The general equation

an + bn = cn
implies that (ad, bd, cd) is a solution for the exponent e

(ad)e + (bd)e = (cd)e.
Thus, to prove that Fermat's equation has no solutions for n > 2, it would suffice to prove that it has no solutions for at least one prime factor of every n. Each integer n > 2 is divisible by 4 or by an odd prime number (or both). Therefore, Fermat's Last Theorem could be proved for all n if it could be proved for n = 4 and for all odd primes p.
In the two centuries following its conjecture (1637–1839), Fermat's Last Theorem was proved for three odd prime exponents p = 3, 5 and 7. The case p = 3 was first stated by Abu-Mahmud Khojandi (10th century), but his attempted proof of the theorem was incorrect.[73][74] In 1770, Leonhard Euler gave a proof of p = 3,[75] but his proof by infinite descent[76] contained a major gap.[77][78][79] However, since Euler himself had proved the lemma necessary to complete the proof in other work, he is generally credited with the first proof.[44][80][81] Independent proofs were published[82] by Kausler (1802),[48] Legendre (1823, 1830),[50][83] Calzolari (1855),[84] Gabriel Lamé (1865),[85] Peter Guthrie Tait (1872),[86] Siegmund Günther (1878),[87] Gambioli (1901),[59] Krey (1909),[88] Rychlík (1910),[64] Stockhaus (1910),[89] Carmichael (1915),[90] Johannes van der Corput (1915),[91] Axel Thue (1917),[92] and Duarte (1944).[93]
The case p = 5 was proved[94] independently by Legendre and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet around 1825.[95][96][44][97] Alternative proofs were developed[98] by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1875, posthumous),[99] Lebesgue (1843),[100] Lamé (1847),[101] Gambioli (1901),[59][102] Werebrusow (1905),[103][full citation needed] Rychlík (1910),[104][dubious – discuss][full citation needed] van der Corput (1915),[91] and Guy Terjanian (1987).[105]
The case p = 7 was proved[106][107][44][97] by Lamé in 1839.[108] His rather complicated proof was simplified in 1840 by Lebesgue,[109] and still simpler proofs[110] were published by Angelo Genocchi in 1864, 1874 and 1876.[111] Alternative proofs were developed by Théophile Pépin (1876)[112] and Edmond Maillet (1897).[113]
Fermat's Last Theorem was also proved for the exponents n = 6, 10, and 14. Proofs for n = 6 were published by Kausler,[48] Thue,[114] Tafelmacher,[115] Lind,[116] Kapferer,[117] Swift,[118] and Breusch.[119] Similarly, Dirichlet[120] and Terjanian[121] each proved the case n = 14, while Kapferer[117] and Breusch[119] each proved the case n = 10. Strictly speaking, these proofs are unnecessary, since these cases follow from the proofs for n = 3, 5, and 7, respectively. Nevertheless, the reasoning of these even-exponent proofs differs from their odd-exponent counterparts. Dirichlet's proof for n = 14 was published in 1832, before Lamé's 1839 proof for n = 7.[122]
All proofs for specific exponents used Fermat's technique of infinite descent,[citation needed] either in its original form, or in the form of descent on elliptic curves or abelian varieties. The details and auxiliary arguments, however, were often ad hoc and tied to the individual exponent under consideration.[123] Since they became ever more complicated as p increased, it seemed unlikely that the general case of Fermat's Last Theorem could be proved by building upon the proofs for individual exponents.[123] Although some general results on Fermat's Last Theorem were published in the early 19th century by Niels Henrik Abel and Peter Barlow,[124][125] the first significant work on the general theorem was done by Sophie Germain.[126]

Early modern breakthroughs[edit]
Sophie Germain[edit]
In the early 19th century, Sophie Germain developed several novel approaches to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all exponents.[127] First, she defined a set of auxiliary primes θ constructed from the prime exponent p by the equation θ = 2hp + 1, where h is any integer not divisible by three. She showed that, if no integers raised to the pth power were adjacent modulo θ (the non-consecutivity condition), then θ must divide the product xyz. Her goal was to use mathematical induction to prove that, for any given p, infinitely many auxiliary primes θ satisfied the non-consecutivity condition and thus divided xyz; since the product xyz can have at most a finite number of prime factors, such a proof would have established Fermat's Last Theorem. Although she developed many techniques for establishing the non-consecutivity condition, she did not succeed in her strategic goal. She also worked to set lower limits on the size of solutions to Fermat's equation for a given exponent p, a modified version of which was published by Adrien-Marie Legendre. As a byproduct of this latter work, she proved Sophie Germain's theorem, which verified the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (namely, the case in which p does not divide xyz) for every odd prime exponent less than 270,[127][128] and for all primes p such that at least one of 2p + 1, 4p + 1, 8p + 1, 10p + 1, 14p + 1 and 16p + 1 is prime (specially, the primes p such that 2p + 1 is prime are called Sophie Germain primes). Germain tried unsuccessfully to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all even exponents, specifically for n = 2p, which was proved by Guy Terjanian in 1977.[129] In 1985, Leonard Adleman, Roger Heath-Brown and Étienne Fouvry proved that the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem holds for infinitely many odd primes p.[130]

Ernst Kummer and the theory of ideals[edit]
In 1847, Gabriel Lamé outlined a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem based on factoring the equation xp + yp = zp in complex numbers, specifically the cyclotomic field based on the roots of the number 1. His proof failed, however, because it assumed incorrectly that such complex numbers can be factored uniquely into primes, similar to integers. This gap was pointed out immediately by Joseph Liouville, who later read a paper that demonstrated this failure of unique factorisation, written by Ernst Kummer.
Kummer set himself the task of determining whether the cyclotomic field could be generalized to include new prime numbers such that unique factorisation was restored. He succeeded in that task by developing the ideal numbers.
(It is often stated that Kummer was led to his ""ideal complex numbers"" by his interest in Fermat's Last Theorem; there is even a story often told that Kummer, like Lamé, believed he had proven Fermat's Last Theorem until Lejeune Dirichlet told him his argument relied on unique factorization; but the story was first told by Kurt Hensel in 1910 and the evidence indicates it likely derives from a confusion by one of Hensel's sources. Harold Edwards said the belief that Kummer was mainly interested in Fermat's Last Theorem ""is surely mistaken"".[131] See the history of ideal numbers.)
Using the general approach outlined by Lamé, Kummer proved both cases of Fermat's Last Theorem for all regular prime numbers. However, he could not prove the theorem for the exceptional primes (irregular primes) that conjecturally occur approximately 39% of the time; the only irregular primes below 270 are 37, 59, 67, 101, 103, 131, 149, 157, 233, 257 and 263.

Mordell conjecture[edit]
In the 1920s, Louis Mordell posed a conjecture that implied that Fermat's equation has at most a finite number of nontrivial primitive integer solutions, if the exponent n is greater than two.[132][133] This conjecture was proved in 1983 by Gerd Faltings,[134] and is now known as Faltings's theorem.

Computational studies[edit]
In the latter half of the 20th century, computational methods were used to extend Kummer's approach to the irregular primes. In 1954, Harry Vandiver used a SWAC computer to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all primes up to 2521.[135] By 1978, Samuel Wagstaff had extended this to all primes less than 125,000.[136] By 1993, Fermat's Last Theorem had been proved for all primes less than four million.[5]
However, despite these efforts and their results, no proof existed of Fermat's Last Theorem. Proofs of individual exponents by their nature could never prove the general case: even if all exponents were verified up to an extremely large number X, a higher exponent beyond X might still exist for which the claim was not true. (This had been the case with some other past conjectures, such as with Skewes' number, and it could not be ruled out in this conjecture.)

Connection with elliptic curves[edit]
The strategy that ultimately led to a successful proof of Fermat's Last Theorem arose from the ""astounding""[137]: 211  Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture, proposed around 1955—which many mathematicians believed would be near to impossible to prove,[137]: 223  and was linked in the 1980s by Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet to Fermat's equation. By accomplishing a partial proof of this conjecture in 1994, Andrew Wiles ultimately succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, as well as leading the way to a full proof by others of what is now known as the modularity theorem.

Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture[edit]
Main article: Modularity theorem
Around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama observed a possible link between two apparently completely distinct branches of mathematics, elliptic curves and modular forms. The resulting modularity theorem (at the time known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) states that every elliptic curve is modular, meaning that it can be associated with a unique modular form.
The link was initially dismissed as unlikely or highly speculative, but was taken more seriously when number theorist André Weil found evidence supporting it, though not proving it; as a result the conjecture was often known as the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture.[137]: 211–215 
Even after gaining serious attention, the conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult or perhaps inaccessible to proof.[137]: 203–205, 223, 226  For example, Wiles's doctoral supervisor John Coates states that it seemed ""impossible to actually prove"",[137]: 226  and Ken Ribet considered himself ""one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible"", adding that ""Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it].""[137]: 223 

Ribet's theorem for Frey curves[edit]
Main articles: Frey curve and Ribet's theorem
In 1984, Gerhard Frey noted a link between Fermat's equation and the modularity theorem, then still a conjecture. If Fermat's equation had any solution (a, b, c) for exponent p > 2, then it could be shown that the semi-stable elliptic curve (now known as a Frey-Hellegouarch[note 3])

y2 = x(x − ap)(x + bp)
would have such unusual properties that it was unlikely to be modular.[138] This would conflict with the modularity theorem, which asserted that all elliptic curves are modular. As such, Frey observed that a proof of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture might also simultaneously prove Fermat's Last Theorem.[139][140] By contraposition, a disproof or refutation of Fermat's Last Theorem would disprove the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture.
In plain English, Frey had shown that, if this intuition about his equation was correct, then any set of four numbers (a, b, c, n) capable of disproving Fermat's Last Theorem, could also be used to disprove the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture. Therefore, if the latter were true, the former could not be disproven, and would also have to be true.
Following this strategy, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem required two steps. First, it was necessary to prove the modularity theorem, or at least to prove it for the types of elliptical curves that included Frey's equation (known as semistable elliptic curves). This was widely believed inaccessible to proof by contemporary mathematicians.[137]: 203–205, 223, 226  Second, it was necessary to show that Frey's intuition was correct: that if an elliptic curve were constructed in this way, using a set of numbers that were a solution of Fermat's equation, the resulting elliptic curve could not be modular. Frey showed that this was plausible but did not go as far as giving a full proof. The missing piece (the so-called ""epsilon conjecture"", now known as Ribet's theorem) was identified by Jean-Pierre Serre who also gave an almost-complete proof and the link suggested by Frey was finally proved in 1986 by Ken Ribet.[141]
Following Frey, Serre and Ribet's work, this was where matters stood:

Fermat's Last Theorem needed to be proven for all exponents n that were prime numbers.
The modularity theorem—if proved for semi-stable elliptic curves—would mean that all semistable elliptic curves must be modular.
Ribet's theorem showed that any solution to Fermat's equation for a prime number could be used to create a semistable elliptic curve that could not be modular;
The only way that both of these statements could be true, was if no solutions existed to Fermat's equation (because then no such curve could be created), which was what Fermat's Last Theorem said. As Ribet's Theorem was already proved, this meant that a proof of the modularity theorem would automatically prove Fermat's Last theorem was true as well.
Wiles's general proof[edit]
Main articles: Andrew Wiles and Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem
British mathematician Andrew Wiles
Ribet's proof of the epsilon conjecture in 1986 accomplished the first of the two goals proposed by Frey. Upon hearing of Ribet's success, Andrew Wiles, an English mathematician with a childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, and who had worked on elliptic curves, decided to commit himself to accomplishing the second half: proving a special case of the modularity theorem (then known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) for semistable elliptic curves.[142][143]
Wiles worked on that task for six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.[137]: 229–230  His initial study suggested proof by induction,[137]: 230–232, 249–252  and he based his initial work and first significant breakthrough on Galois theory[137]: 251–253, 259  before switching to an attempt to extend horizontal Iwasawa theory for the inductive argument around 1990–91 when it seemed that there was no existing approach adequate to the problem.[137]: 258–259  However, by mid-1991, Iwasawa theory also seemed to not be reaching the central issues in the problem.[137]: 259–260 [144][145] In response, he approached colleagues to seek out any hints of cutting-edge research and new techniques, and discovered an Euler system recently developed by Victor Kolyvagin and Matthias Flach that seemed ""tailor made"" for the inductive part of his proof.[137]: 260–261  Wiles studied and extended this approach, which worked. Since his work relied extensively on this approach, which was new to mathematics and to Wiles, in January 1993 he asked his Princeton colleague, Nick Katz, to help him check his reasoning for subtle errors. Their conclusion at the time was that the techniques Wiles used seemed to work correctly.[137]: 261–265 [146][147]
By mid-May 1993, Wiles was ready to tell his wife he thought he had solved the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem,[137]: 265  and by June he felt sufficiently confident to present his results in three lectures delivered on 21–23 June 1993 at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences.[148][149] Specifically, Wiles presented his proof of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture for semistable elliptic curves; together with Ribet's proof of the epsilon conjecture, this implied Fermat's Last Theorem. However, it became apparent during peer review that a critical point in the proof was incorrect. It contained an error in a bound on the order of a particular group. The error was caught by several mathematicians refereeing Wiles's manuscript including Katz (in his role as reviewer),[150] who alerted Wiles on 23 August 1993.[151]
The error would not have rendered his work worthless: each part of Wiles's work was highly significant and innovative by itself, as were the many developments and techniques he had created in the course of his work, and only one part was affected.[137]: 289, 296–297  However, without this part proved, there was no actual proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles spent almost a year trying to repair his proof, initially by himself and then in collaboration with his former student Richard Taylor, without success.[152][153][154] By the end of 1993, rumours had spread that under scrutiny, Wiles's proof had failed, but how seriously was not known. Mathematicians were beginning to pressure Wiles to disclose his work whether it was complete or not, so that the wider community could explore and use whatever he had managed to accomplish. But instead of being fixed, the problem, which had originally seemed minor, now seemed very significant, far more serious, and less easy to resolve.[155]
Wiles states that on the morning of 19 September 1994, he was on the verge of giving up and was almost resigned to accepting that he had failed, and to publishing his work so that others could build on it and fix the error. He adds that he was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he had a sudden insight: that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin–Flach approach would not work directly also meant that his original attempts using Iwasawa theory could be made to work, if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin–Flach approach. Fixing one approach with tools from the other approach would resolve the issue for all the cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper.[152][156] He described later that Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin–Flach approach were each inadequate on their own, but together they could be made powerful enough to overcome this final hurdle.[152]

I was sitting at my desk examining the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn't work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, but it was all I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking to see if it was still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much.— Andrew Wiles, as quoted by Simon Singh[157]
On 24 October 1994, Wiles submitted two manuscripts, ""Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem""[158][159] and ""Ring theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras"",[160] the second of which was co-authored with Taylor and proved that certain conditions were met that were needed to justify the corrected step in the main paper. The two papers were vetted and published as the entirety of the May 1995 issue of the Annals of Mathematics. The proof's method of identification of a deformation ring with a Hecke algebra (now referred to as an R=T theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.
These papers established the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, the last step in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, 358 years after it was conjectured.

Subsequent developments[edit]
The full Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was finally proved by Diamond (1996),[10] Conrad et al. (1999),[11] and Breuil et al. (2001)[12] who, building on Wiles's work, incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved. The now fully proved conjecture became known as the modularity theorem.
Several other theorems in number theory similar to Fermat's Last Theorem also follow from the same reasoning, using the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two coprime nth powers, n ≥ 3. (The case n = 3 was already known by Euler.)

Relationship to other problems and generalizations[edit]
Fermat's Last Theorem considers solutions to the Fermat equation: an + bn = cn with positive integers a, b, and c and an integer n greater than 2. There are several generalizations of the Fermat equation to more general equations that allow the exponent n to be a negative integer or rational, or to consider three different exponents.

Generalized Fermat equation[edit]
The generalized Fermat equation generalizes the statement of Fermat's last theorem by considering positive integer solutions a, b, c, m, n, k satisfying[161]






a

m


+

b

n


=

c

k


.


{\displaystyle a^{m}+b^{n}=c^{k}.}

  1
In particular, the exponents m, n, k need not be equal, whereas Fermat's last theorem considers the case m = n = k.
The Beal conjecture, also known as the Mauldin conjecture[162] and the Tijdeman-Zagier conjecture,[163][164][165] states that there are no solutions to the generalized Fermat equation in positive integers a, b, c, m, n, k with a, b, and c being pairwise coprime and all of m, n, k being greater than 2.[166]
The Fermat–Catalan conjecture generalizes Fermat's last theorem with the ideas of the Catalan conjecture.[167][168] The conjecture states that the generalized Fermat equation has only finitely many solutions (a, b, c, m, n, k) with distinct triplets of values (am, bn, ck), where a, b, c are positive coprime integers and m, n, k are positive integers satisfying

m


+


1
n

1.


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{m}}+{\frac {1}{n}}+{\frac {1}{k}}<1.}

  2
The statement is about the finiteness of the set of solutions because there are 10 known solutions.[161]

Inverse Fermat equation[edit]
When we allow the exponent n to be the reciprocal of an integer, i.e. n = 1/m for some integer m, we have the inverse Fermat equation a1/m + b1/m = c1/m.
All solutions of this equation were computed by Hendrik Lenstra in 1992.[169] In the case in which the mth roots are required to be real and positive, all solutions are given by[170]





a

c

)

m




{\displaystyle c=r(s+t)^{m}}


for positive integers r, s, t with s and t coprime.

Rational exponents[edit]
For the Diophantine equation an/m + bn/m = cn/m with n not equal to 1, Bennett, Glass, and Székely proved in 2004 for n > 2, that if n and m are coprime, then there are integer solutions if and only if 6 divides m, and a1/m, b1/m, and c1/m are different complex 6th roots of the same real number.[171]

Negative integer exponents[edit]
n = −1[edit]
All primitive integer solutions (i.e., those with no prime factor common to all of a, b, and c) to the optic equation a−1 + b−1 = c−1 can be written as[172]





a

m
k
+

{\displaystyle c=mk}


for positive, coprime integers m, k.

n = −2[edit]
The case n = −2 also has an infinitude of solutions, and these have a geometric interpretation in terms of right triangles with integer sides and an integer altitude to the hypotenuse.[173][174] All primitive solutions to a−2 + b−2 = d−2 are given by

for coprime integers u, v with v > u. The geometric interpretation is that a and b are the integer legs of a right triangle and d is the integer altitude to the hypotenuse. Then the hypotenuse itself is the integer

so (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple.

n < −2[edit]
There are no solutions in integers for an + bn = cn for integers n < −2. If there were, the equation could be multiplied through by a|n|b|n|c|n| to obtain (bc)|n| + (ac)|n| = (ab)|n|, which is impossible by Fermat's Last Theorem.

abc conjecture[edit]
Main article: abc conjecture § Some consequences
The abc conjecture roughly states that if three positive integers a, b and c (hence the name) are coprime and satisfy a + b = c, then the radical d of abc is usually not much smaller than c. In particular, the abc conjecture in its most standard formulation implies Fermat's last theorem for n that are sufficiently large.[175][176][177] The modified Szpiro conjecture is equivalent to the abc conjecture and therefore has the same implication.[178][177] An effective version of the abc conjecture, or an effective version of the modified Szpiro conjecture, implies Fermat's Last Theorem outright.[177]

Prizes and incorrect proofs[edit]
In 1816, and again in 1850, the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.[179][180] In 1857, the academy awarded 3,000 francs and a gold medal to Kummer for his research on ideal numbers, although he had not submitted an entry for the prize.[179] Another prize was offered in 1883 by the Academy of Brussels.[181]
In 1908, the German industrialist and amateur mathematician Paul Wolfskehl bequeathed 100,000 gold marks—a large sum at the time—to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences to offer as a prize for a complete proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.[182][183] On 27 June 1908, the academy published nine rules for awarding the prize. Among other things, these rules required that the proof be published in a peer-reviewed journal; the prize would not be awarded until two years after the publication; and that no prize would be given after 13 September 2007, roughly a century after the competition was begun.[184] Wiles collected the Wolfskehl prize money, then worth $50,000, on 27 June 1997.[185] In March 2016, Wiles was awarded the Norwegian government's Abel prize worth €600,000 for ""his stunning proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by way of the modularity conjecture for semistable elliptic curves, opening a new era in number theory"".[186]
Prior to Wiles's proof, thousands of incorrect proofs were submitted to the Wolfskehl committee, amounting to roughly 10 feet (3.0 meters) of correspondence.[187] In the first year alone (1907–1908), 621 attempted proofs were submitted, although by the 1970s, the rate of submission had decreased to roughly 3–4 attempted proofs per month. According to some claims, Edmund Landau tended to use a special preprinted form for such proofs, where the location of the first mistake was left blank to be filled by one of his graduate students.[188] According to F. Schlichting, a Wolfskehl reviewer, most of the proofs were based on elementary methods taught in schools, and often submitted by ""people with a technical education but a failed career"".[189] In the words of mathematical historian Howard Eves, ""Fermat's Last Theorem has the peculiar distinction of being the mathematical problem for which the greatest number of incorrect proofs have been published.""[181]

In popular culture[edit]
Main article: Fermat's Last Theorem in fiction
The popularity of the theorem outside science has led to it being described as achieving ""that rarest of mathematical accolades: A niche role in pop culture.""[190]Czech postage stamp commemorating Wiles' proof
Arthur Porges' 1954 short story ""The Devil and Simon Flagg"" features a mathematician who bargains with the Devil that the latter cannot produce a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem within twenty-four hours.[191]
In The Simpsons episode ""The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace"", Homer Simpson writes the equation 398712 + 436512 = 447212 on a blackboard, which appears to be a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem. The equation is wrong, but it appears to be correct if entered in a calculator with 10 significant figures.[192]
In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ""The Royale"", Captain Picard states that the theorem is still unproven in the 24th century. The proof was released five years after the episode originally aired.[193]

Footnotes[edit]


^ If the exponent n were not prime or 4, then it would be possible to write n either as a product of two smaller integers (n = PQ), in which P is a prime number greater than 2, and then an = aPQ = (aQ)P for each of a, b, and c. That is, an equivalent solution would also have to exist for the prime power P that is smaller than n; or else as n would be a power of 2 greater than 4, and writing n = 4Q, the same argument would hold.

^ For example, ((jr + 1)s)r + (j(jr + 1)s)r = (jr + 1)rs+1.

^ This elliptic curve was first suggested in the 1960s by Yves Hellegouarch [de], but he did not call attention to its non-modularity. For more details, see Hellegouarch, Yves (2001). Invitation to the Mathematics of Fermat-Wiles. Academic Press. ISBN 978-0-12-339251-0.

"
What is the moral dispute over the use of solitary confinement in prisons?,"The use of solitary confinement in prisons has been the subject of much debate and controversy. Some argue that it is a necessary tool for managing dangerous and violent offenders, while others contend that it is a cruel and inhumane practice that violates basic human rights.

One of the most famous cases of solitary confinement in prisons is that of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was placed in solitary confinement for 42 days in 1955 for his role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. King was accused of inciting violence and violating the segregation laws of the time, and he was subjected to harsh conditions while in solitary confinement.

Another example of solitary confinement in prisons is that of the Black Panther Party, who were placed in solitary confinement for their political activities in the 1960s. The Black Panthers were accused of inciting violence and spreading propaganda, and they were subjected to harsh conditions while in solitary confinement.

There are also many examples of solitary confinement being used in prisons around the world. In the United States, for example, there have been numerous cases of prisoners being placed in solitary confinement for extended periods of time, often without access to therapy, education, or other forms of rehabilitation.

In addition to the moral and ethical concerns surrounding solitary confinement, there are also concerns about the impact it has on prisoners' physical and mental health. Solitary confinement has been linked to a number of negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and even suicide.

Overall, the use of solitary confinement in prisons has been the subject of much debate and controversy. While some argue that it is a necessary tool for managing dangerous and violent offenders, others contend that it is a cruel and inhumane practice that violates basic human rights. The debate surrounding solitary confinement is ongoing, and it is likely to continue for some time.",True,https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/Solitary%20Confinement%20in%20the%20US.pdf,
What is the Facebook privacy breaches issue?,"Facebook has faced numerous privacy breaches over the years, with some of the most notable incidents including:

1. The Cambridge Analytica Scandal: In 2018, it was revealed that Facebook had provided data to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, which had used the data to target voters with personalized political ads during the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook was criticized for not adequately protecting user privacy, and for allowing the data to be harvested without users' knowledge or consent.
2. The 2012 Facebook Data Breach: In 2012, it was discovered that Facebook had suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of more than 50 million users. The breach was caused by a bug in Facebook's code, which allowed hackers to access user data.
3. The 2014 Facebook Data Breach: In 2014, it was revealed that Facebook had suffered another data breach that exposed the personal information of at least 87 million users. The breach was caused by a bug in Facebook's code that allowed hackers to access user data.
4. The 2019 Facebook Data Breach: In 2019, it was discovered that Facebook had suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of at least 50 million users. The breach was caused by a bug in Facebook's code that allowed hackers to access user data.
5. The 2020 Facebook Data Breach: In 2020, it was discovered that Facebook had suffered another data breach that exposed the personal information of at least 100 million users. The breach was caused by a bug in Facebook's code that allowed hackers to access user data.

These are just a few examples of the many privacy breaches that Facebook has faced over the years. Facebook has faced criticism for not adequately protecting user privacy, and for allowing data to be harvested without users' knowledge or consent. The company has faced legal action and regulatory scrutiny in response to these breaches, and has made efforts to improve its privacy practices in response to public outcry.",True,https://www.npr.org/2021/04/09/986005820/after-data-breach-exposes-530-million-facebook-says-it-will-not-notify-users,"

Facebook decided not to notify over 530 million of its users whose personal data was lifted in a breach sometime before August 2019 and was recently made available in a public database. Facebook also has no plans to do so, a spokesperson said. Phone numbers, full names, locations, some email addresses, and other details from user profiles were posted to an amateur hacking forum on Saturday, Business Insider reported last week. The leaked data includes personal information from 533 million Facebook users in 106 countries. In response to the reporting, Facebook said in a blog post on Tuesday that ""malicious actors"" had scraped the data by exploiting a vulnerability in a now-defunct feature on the platform that allowed users to find each other by phone number.

National Security 
After A Major Hack, U.S. Looks To Fix A Cyber 'Blind Spot'






The social media company said it found and fixed the issue in August 2019 and its confident the same route can no longer be used to scrape that data. ""We don't currently have plans to notify users individually,"" a Facebook spokesman told NPR.  According to the spokesman, the company does not have complete confidence in knowing which users would need to be notified. He also said that in deciding whether to notify users, Facebook weighed the fact that the information was publicly available and that it was not an issue that users could fix themselves. The information did not include financial information, health information or passwords, Facebook said, but the data leak still leaves users vulnerable, security experts say. ""Scammers can do an enormous amount with little information from us,"" says CyberScout founder Adam Levin, a cybersecurity expert and consumer protection advocate. In the case of this breach, he said, ""It's serious when phone numbers are out there. The danger when you have phone numbers in particular is a universal identifier."" Phone numbers are increasingly used to connect people to their digital presence, including the use of two-factor authentication via text message and phone calls to verify one's identity.

FTC To Hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Liable For Any Future Privacy Violations






The misuse of its user data is a familiar battle for Facebook, and its handling of user privacy has endured scrutiny. In July 2019, months before patching up the aforementioned issue, Facebook reached a $5 billion settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for violating an agreement with the agency to protect user privacy. To find out whether your personal information was leaked in the breach, you can check the data tracking tool, HaveIBeenPwnd. Its creator, Troy Hunt, updated the site with the latest data from the Facebook leak. Hunt said that 65% of the latest batch of data had already been added to the tracker from previous leaks.

"
Who is Mete Gazoz?,"Mete Gazoz (born February 20, 1989) is a Turkish professional basketball player who currently plays for the Anadolu Efes of the Turkish Basketbol Süper Ligi (BSL). He is a 6'10"" (2.08 m) center.

Gazoz began his professional career with Efes Pilsen in 2008, and has since played for several other Turkish teams, including Fenerbahçe, Beşiktaş, and Darüşşafaka. He has also played for the Turkish national team, winning the bronze medal at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.

Gazoz was selected 11th overall in the 2012 NBA draft by the New York Knicks, but did not play for the team. He has since played in the NBA Development League, and has also played for several other European teams.

Gazoz is known for his versatility on the court, and has been able to play both center and power forward positions. He is also a good free throw shooter, making 85.5% of his attempts in the 2019-2020 season.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is an intergovernmental international radio telescope project being built in Australia (low-frequency) and South Africa (mid-frequency). The combining infrastructure, the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), and headquarters, are located at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in the United Kingdom. The SKA cores are being built in the southern hemisphere, where the view of the Milky Way galaxy is the best and radio interference is at its least.
Conceived in the 1990s, and further developed and designed by the late-2010s, when completed sometime in the 2020s it will have a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre. It will operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size will make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. If built as planned, it should be able to survey the sky more than ten thousand times faster than before. With receiving stations extending out to a distance of at least 3,000 km (1,900 mi) from a concentrated central core, it will exploit radio astronomy's ability to provide the highest-resolution images in all astronomy.
The SKAO consortium was founded in Rome in March 2019 by seven initial member countries, with several others subsequently joining; as of 2021[update] there were 14 members of the consortium. This international organisation is tasked with building and operating the facility. The project has two phases of construction: the current SKA1, commonly just called SKA, and a possible later significantly enlarged phase sometimes called SKA2. The construction phase of the project began on 5 December 2022 in both South Africa and Australia.


History[edit]
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) was originally conceived in 1991 with an international working group set up in 1993. This led to the signing of the first Memorandum of Agreement in 2000.[1]
In the early days of planning, China vied to host the SKA, proposing to build several large dishes in the natural limestone depressions (karst) that dimple its southwestern provinces; China called their proposal Kilometer-square Area Radio Synthesis Telescope (KARST).[2][3]
Australia's first radio quiet zone was established by the Australian Communications and Media Authority on 11 April 2005 specifically to protect and maintain the current ""radio-quietness"" of the main Australian SKA site at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory.[4]
The project has two phases of construction: the current SKA1, commonly just called SKA, and a possible later significantly enlarged phase sometimes called SKA2.[5] PrepSKA commenced in 2008, leading to a full SKA design in 2012. Construction of Phase 1 was scheduled to take place from 2018 to 2020,[needs update] providing an operational array, with Phase 2 completion in 2025.[citation needed]

The SKA headquarters at Jodrell Bank, with the Lovell Telescope in the background
In April 2011, Jodrell Bank Observatory of the University of Manchester, in Cheshire, England was announced as the location for the project headquarters.[6] In November 2011, the SKA Organisation was formed as an intergovernmental organisation[7] and the project moved from a collaboration to an independent, not for profit, company.[8]
In February 2012, a former Australian SKA Committee[clarification needed] chairman raised concerns with South African media about risks at the Australian candidate site, particularly in terms of cost, mining interference and land agreements. SKA Australia stated that all points had been addressed in the site bid.[9] In March 2012 it was reported that the SKA Site Advisory Committee had made a confidential report in February that the South African bid was stronger.[10] However a scientific working group was set up to explore possible implementation options of the two candidate host regions,[11] and on 25 May 2012 it was announced that it had been determined that the SKA would be split over the South African and African sites, and the Australia and New Zealand sites.[12] While New Zealand remained a member of the SKA Organisation in 2014, it appeared that no SKA infrastructure was likely to be located in New Zealand.[13]
In April 2015, the headquarters of the SKA project were chosen to be located at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in the UK,[14][15] officially opened in July 2019.[citation needed]
Initial construction contracts began in 2018. Scientific observations with the fully completed array are not expected any earlier than 2027.[16][17]
On 12 March 2019, the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) was founded in Rome by seven initial member countries: Australia, China, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa and the United Kingdom. India and Sweden are expected to follow shortly, and eight other countries have expressed interest to join in the future. This international organisation was tasked with building and operating the facility, with the first construction contracts expected to be awarded in late 2020.[needs update][18]
By mid-2019, the start of scientific observations were expected to start no earlier than 2027.[16] In July 2019, New Zealand withdrew from the project.[16]
As of November 2020[update], five precursor facilities were already operating: MeerKAT and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) in South Africa, the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) and Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Western Australia and the International LOFAR Telescope, spread across Europe with a core in the Netherlands.[19]
The construction phase of the project began on 5 December 2022 in Australia and South Africa, with delegations from each of the eight countries leading the project attending ceremonies to celebrate the event.[20] The Australian part of the project comprises 100,000 antennas built across 74 km (46 mi), also in the Murchison region, in the traditional lands of the Wajarri Aboriginal people. Bulldozers were expected to start working on the site in early 2023,[needs update] with the completion date estimated as 2028. The site has been named Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, which means 'sharing sky and stars' in the Wajarri language.[21]
The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in India and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) are investigating the possibility of establishing supercomputing facilities to handle data from the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope. The UK and India are part of the team developing the computational processing for the SKA radio telescope.[22] On 3 January 2024, Indian government approved joining the SKA project accompanied by a financial commitment of ₹1,250 crore which marks the initial step towards ratification as a member state.[23]

Description[edit]
Countries that participated in the preparatory phase of SKA[24]
The SKA will combine the signals received from thousands of small antennas spread over a distance of several thousand kilometres to simulate a single giant radio telescope capable of extremely high sensitivity and angular resolution, using a technique called aperture synthesis.[25] Some of the sub-arrays of the SKA will also have a very large field-of-view (FOV), making it possible to survey very large areas of sky at once.[26] One innovative development is the use of focal-plane arrays using phased-array technology to provide multiple FOVs.[27] This will greatly increase the survey speed of the SKA and enable several users to observe different pieces of the sky simultaneously, which is useful for (e.g.) monitoring multiple pulsars. The combination of a very large FOV with high sensitivity means that the SKA will be able to compile extremely large surveys of the sky considerably faster than any other telescope.[28]
The combined SKA will provide a wide range of coverage, with Australia's Murchison Widefield Array providing low-frequency coverage and South Africa's MeerKAT providing mid-frequency coverage.[29][30][5] There will be continuous frequency coverage from 50 MHz to 14 GHz in the first two phases of its construction.

Phase 1: Providing ~10% of the total collecting area at low and mid frequencies by 2023 (SKA1).[31]
Phase 2: Completion of the full array (SKA2) at low and mid frequencies by 2030.[32]
The frequency range from 50 MHz to 14 GHz, spanning more than two decades, cannot be realised using one design of antenna and so the SKA will comprise separate sub-arrays of different types of antenna elements that will make up the SKA-low, SKA-mid and survey arrays:

Artist's impression of a Low-Band SKA Sparse Aperture Array Station
Artist's impression of a SKA Dense Aperture Array Station
SKA-low array: a phased array of simple dipole antennas to cover the frequency range from 50 to 350 MHz. These will be grouped in 40 m diameter stations each containing 256 vertically oriented dual-polarisation dipole elements.[33] Stations will be arranged with 75% located within a 2 km diameter core and the remaining stations situated on three spiral arms, extending out to a radius of 50 km.[34]
SKA-mid array: an array of several thousand dish antennas (around 200 to be built in Phase 1) to cover the frequency range 350 MHz to 14 GHz. It is expected that the antenna design will follow that of the Allen Telescope Array using an offset Gregorian design having a height of 15 metres and a width of 12 metres.[31][35]
SKA-survey array: a compact array of parabolic dishes of 12–15 meters diameter each for the medium-frequency range, each equipped with a multi-beam, phased array feed with a large field of view and several receiving systems covering about 350 MHz – 4 GHz. The survey sub-array was removed from the SKA1 specification following a ""rebaselining"" exercise in 2015.[36]
The area covered by the SKA – extending out to ~3000 km – will comprise three regions:[25][37]

A central region containing about 5 km diameter cores of SKA-mid antennas (South Africa) and SKA-low dipoles (Western Australia). These central regions will contain approximately half of the total collecting area of the SKA arrays.
A mid region extending out to 180 km. This will contain dishes and pairs of SKA-mid and SKA-low stations. In each case they will be randomly placed within the area with the density of dishes and stations falling off towards the outer part of the region.
An outer region from 180 km to 3000 km. This will comprise five spiral arms, along which dishes of SKA-mid, grouped into stations of 20 dishes, will be located. The separation of the stations increases towards the outer ends of the spiral arms.
Costs[edit]
The SKA was estimated to cost €1.8 billion in 2014, including €650 million for Phase 1, which represented about 10% of the planned capability of the entire telescope array.[38][39] There have been numerous delays and rising costs over the nearly 30-year history of the intergovernmental project.[16]
As of December 2022[update], the whole project was reported to be worth around A$3 billion.[21]

SKA locations[edit]
An automatic wideband radio scanner system was used to survey the radio frequency noise levels at the various candidate sites in South Africa.The headquarters of the SKA are located at the University of Manchester's Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, England,[44] while the telescopes will be installed in Australia and South Africa.[45]
Suitable sites for the SKA telescope must be in unpopulated areas with guaranteed very low levels of man-made radio interference. Four sites were initially proposed in South Africa, Australia, Argentina and China.[46] After considerable site evaluation surveys, Argentina and China were dropped and the other two sites were shortlisted (with New Zealand joining the Australian bid, and 8 other African countries joining the South African bid):[47]

Australia[edit]
The core site is located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) at Mileura Station near Boolardy in the state of Western Australia, 315 km (196 mi) north-east of Geraldton[48][49]

South Africa[edit]
The core site is located at the Meerkat National Park, at an elevation of about 1000 metres, in the Karoo area of the arid Northern Cape Province. There are also distant stations in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia.[50]

Precursors, pathfinders and design studies[edit]
Many groups are working globally to develop the technology and techniques required for the SKA. Their contributions to the international SKA project are classified as either: Precursors, Pathfinders or Design Studies.

Precursor facility: A telescope on one of the two SKA candidate sites, carrying out SKA-related activity.
Pathfinder: A telescope or programme carrying out SKA-related technology, science and operations activity.
Design Study: A study of one or more major sub-systems of the SKA design, including the construction of prototypes
Precursor facilities[edit]

Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)[edit]
Main article: Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
The Australian SKA Pathfinder, or ASKAP, is an A$100 million project which built a telescope array of thirty-six twelve-metre dishes. It employs advanced, innovative technologies such as phased array feeds to give a wide field of view (30 square degrees). ASKAP was built by CSIRO at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory site, located near Boolardy in the mid-west region of Western Australia. All 36 antennas and their technical systems were officially opened in October 2012.[51]

MeerKAT[edit]
MeerKAT telescopes in the Meerkat National Park in the Karoo
Main article: MeerKAT
MeerKAT is a South African project consisting of an array of sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter dishes as a world class science instrument, and was also built to help develop technology for the SKA.
KAT-7, a seven-dish engineering and science testbed instrument for MeerKAT, in the Meerkat National Park near Carnarvon in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa was commissioned in 2012 and was up and running by May 2018 when all sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter (44.3 feet) dish antennae were completed, with verification tests then underway to ensure the instruments are functioning correctly.[52][needs update] The dishes are equipped with a number of high performance single pixel feeds to cover frequencies from 580 MHz up to 14 GHz.[53]

Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)[edit]
Main article: Murchison Widefield Array
The Murchison Widefield Array[54] is a low-frequency radio array operating in the frequency range 80–300 MHz that began upgraded operation in 2018 at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory site in Western Australia.

Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)[edit]
Main article: Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array
The HERA array is located in South Africa's Meerkat National Park. It is designed to study highly redshifted atomic hydrogen emission emitted prior to, and during the epoch of reionization.

Allen Telescope Array[edit]
Main article: Allen Telescope Array
The Allen Telescope Array in California uses innovative 6.1m offset Gregorian dishes equipped with wide band single feeds covering frequencies from 500 MHz to 11 GHz. The 42-element array in operation by 2017 is to be extended to 350 elements.[when?] The dish design has explored methods of low-cost manufacture.[65]

LOFAR[edit]
Main article: Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR)
The International LOFAR Telescope —a €150 million Dutch-led project— a novel low-frequency phased aperture array spread over northern Europe. An all-electronic telescope covering low frequencies from 10 to 240 MHz, it came online from 2009 to 2011. LOFAR was in 2017 developing crucial processing techniques for the SKA.[66][needs update]. Because of its baselines of up to 2000 km, it can make images with sub-arcsecond angular resolution over a wide field of view. Such high-resolution imaging at low frequencies is unique and will be a factor of more than an order of magnitude better than SKA1-LOW.

Data challenges[edit]
The amount of sensory data collected poses a huge storage problem, and will require real-time signal processing to reduce the raw data to relevant derived information. In mid 2011 it was estimated the array could generate an exabyte a day of raw data, which could be compressed to around 10 petabytes.[73] China, a founding member of the project, has designed and constructed the first prototype of the regional data processing centre. An Tao, head of the SKA group of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, stated, ""It will generate data streams far beyond the total Internet traffic worldwide."" The Tianhe-2 supercomputer was used in 2016 to train the software. The processing of the project will be performed on Chinese-designed and -manufactured[74][75] Virtex-7 processors by Xilinx, integrated into platforms by the CSIRO.[76] China has pushed for a unified beamforming design that has led other major countries to drop out of the project.[77] Canada continues to use Altera Stratix-10 processors (by Intel).[78] It is illegal for any US company to export high end Intel FPGAs or any related CSP design details or firmware to China[79] amid the US-embargo[80][81][82][83] which will severely limit cooperation.[citation needed]

Technology Development Project (TDP)[edit]
The Technology Development Project, or TDP, is a US$12 million project to specifically develop dish and feed technology for the SKA. It is operated by a consortium of universities[clarification needed] and was completed in 2012.[84]

Project risks and opposition[edit]
Potential risks for priority astronomical sites in South Africa are protected by the Astronomy Geographic Advantage Act of 2007.[85] Put in place to specifically support the South African SKA bid, it outlaws all activities that could endanger scientific operation of core astronomical instruments. In 2010, concerns were raised over the will to enforce this law when Royal Dutch Shell applied to explore the Karoo for shale gas using hydraulic fracturing, an activity that would have the potential to increase radio interference at the site.[86]
An identified remote station location for the southern African array in Mozambique was subject to flooding and excluded from the project,[87] despite the SKA Site Selection Committee technical analysis reporting that all African remote stations could implement flood mitigation solutions.[88]
During 2014, South Africa experienced a month-long strike action by the National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA), which added to the delays of the installation of dishes.[89]
The largest risk to the overall project is probably its budget, which up until 2014 had not been committed.[90]
There has been opposition to the project from farmers, businesses, and individuals in South Africa since the project's inception.[91] The advocacy group called Save the Karoo has stated that the radio quiet zone would create further unemployment in the South African region where unemployment is already above 32%.[92] Farmers had stated that the agriculture-based economy in the Karoo would collapse if they were forced to sell their land.[93][94]

Schematic of the SKA Central Region
The capabilities of the SKA will be designed to address a wide range of questions in astrophysics, fundamental physics, cosmology and particle astrophysics as well as extending the range of the observable universe. A number of key science projects that have been selected for implementation via the SKA are listed below.

Extreme tests of general relativity[edit]
Main article: Tests of general relativity
For almost one hundred years, Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity has precisely predicted the outcome of every experiment made to test it. Most of these tests, including the most stringent ones, have been carried out using radio astronomical measurements. By using pulsars as cosmic gravitational wave detectors, or timing pulsars found orbiting black holes, astronomers will be able to examine the limits of general relativity such as the behaviour of spacetime in regions of extremely curved space. The goal is to reveal whether Einstein was correct in his description of space, time and gravity, or whether alternatives to general relativity are needed to account for these phenomena.

Galaxies, cosmology, dark matter and dark energy[edit]
Main articles: Galaxy formation and evolution and Dark matter
The sensitivity of the SKA in the 21 cm hydrogen line will map a billion galaxies out to the edge of the observable Universe. The large-scale structure of the cosmos thus revealed will give constraints to determine the processes resulting in galaxy formation and evolution. Imaging hydrogen throughout the Universe will provide a three-dimensional picture of the first ripples of structure that formed individual galaxies and clusters. This may also allow the measurement of effects hypothetically caused by dark energy and causing the increasing rate of expansion of the universe.[95]
The cosmological measurements enabled by SKA galaxy surveys include testing models of dark energy,[96] gravity,[97] the primordial universe,[98] and fundamental cosmology,[99] and they are summarised in a series of papers available online.[100][101][102][103]

Epoch of re-ionization[edit]
The SKA is intended to provide observational data from the so-called Dark Ages (between 300,000 years after the Big Bang when the universe became cool enough for hydrogen to become neutral and decouple from radiation) and the time of First Light (a billion years later when young galaxies are seen to form for the first time and hydrogen becomes ionized again). By observing the primordial distribution of gas, the SKA should be able to see how the Universe gradually lit up as its stars and galaxies formed and then evolved. This period of the Dark Ages, culminating in First Light, is considered the first chapter in the cosmic story of creation, and the resolving power required to see this event is the reason for the Square Kilometre Array's design. To see back to First Light requires a telescope 100 times more powerful than the biggest radio telescopes currently in the world, taking up 1 million square metres of collecting area, or one square kilometre.[104]

Cosmic magnetism[edit]
It is still not possible to answer basic questions about the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields, but it is clear that they are an important component of interstellar and intergalactic space. By mapping the effects of magnetism on the radiation from very distant galaxies, the SKA will investigate the form of cosmic magnetism and the role it has played in the evolving Universe.

Search for extraterrestrial life[edit]
This key science program, called ""Cradle of Life"", will focus on three objectives: observing protoplanetary discs in habitable zones, searching for prebiotic chemistry, and contributing to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).[105]

The SKA will be able to probe the habitable zone of Sun-like protostars, where Earth-like planets or moons are most likely to have environments favourable for the development of life.[106] The signatures of forming Earth-like planets imprinted on circumstellar dust may be the most conspicuous evidence of their presence and evolution,[106] and may even detect planets capable of supporting life.[106][107]
Astrobiologists will also use the SKA to search for complex organic compounds (carbon-containing chemicals) in outer space, including amino acids, by identifying spectral lines at specific frequencies.[106]
The SKA will be capable of detecting extremely weak radio emission ""leakage"" from nearby extraterrestrial civilizations, if they exist.[106]

What is the Pandora virus?,"The Pandora virus is a type of computer virus that was first identified in 1999. It was named after the Pandora's Box in Greek mythology, which represents the act of unleashing chaos and destruction.

The virus was spread through email attachments and infected systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office software. It was designed to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, passwords, and financial data.

The Pandora virus was known for its ability to infect multiple systems at once, making it difficult to stop its spread. It also had the ability to bypass antivirus software and evade detection.

Some specific details about the Pandora virus include:

* The virus was first identified in 1999
* It was named after the Pandora's Box in Greek mythology
* It was spread through email attachments and infected systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office software
* It was designed to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, passwords, and financial data
* It was known for its ability to infect multiple systems at once
* It also had the ability to bypass antivirus software and evade detection

It's important to note that antivirus software can help protect against viruses like the Pandora virus, but it's always a good idea to be cautious and avoid downloading or opening suspicious attachments.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoravirus,"

Pandoravirus is a proposed genus of giant virus, first discovered in 2013.[5] It is the third largest in physical size of any known viral genus, behind Pithovirus and Megaklothovirus.[6] Pandoraviruses have double stranded DNA genomes, with the largest genome size (2.5 million base pairs) of any known viral genus.[7]


Discovery[edit]
The discovery of Pandoraviruses by a team of French scientists, led by husband and wife Jean-Michel Claverie and Chantal Abergel, was announced in a report in the journal Science in July 2013.[5] Other scientists had previously observed the pandoravirus particles, but owing to their enormous size they were not expected to be viruses.[5] Patrick Scheid, a parasitologist from the Central Institute of the Bundeswehr Medical Service in Koblenz, Germany, found one in 2008, in an amoeba living in the contact lens of a woman with keratitis. Its development within the amoebal host was documented extensively. Unlike in other cases with such giant viruses, the large particles within Acanthamoeba were not mistaken for bacteria. The authors initially termed them ""endocytobionts"".[8]
Mimivirus, a nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus with a genome size of about 1.1 megabases, was described in 1992 but not recognized as a virus until 2003.[9] Megavirus, discovered in seawater off the coast of Chile in 2011, has a genome size of approximately 1.2 megabases.[10]
The prior discovery of these viruses prompted a search for other types of large amoeba-infecting viruses, which led to the finding of two species; Pandoravirus salinus, found in seawater taken from the coast of Chile, with a genome size of ~2.5 megabases, and Pandoravirus dulcis, found in a shallow freshwater pond in La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia, with a 1.9 megabase genome.[5][11]

Description[edit]
Pandoraviruses are oval in shape and are about 1 micrometer (1000 nanometers) in length. Other viruses range from 25 to 100 nanometers. In addition to being large physically, Pandoraviruses have a large genome made up of 2,500 genes, compared to only 10 genes on average in other viruses. For example, the Influenza A virus contains 7 genes and HIV contains only 9 genes. Gene content varies among species of Pandoravirus, with Pandoravirus salinus containing 2,500 genes and Pandoravirus dulcis containing about 1,500 genes. Pandoraviruses were originally mistaken for bacteria; however, they lack some of the characteristics of bacteria, such as the ability to make their own proteins. The dissimilarity of the remaining genes to any cellular genes led researchers to speculate that this virus represents a previously unknown branch of the tree of life. However, other experts have called this proposal premature because there is very little evidence supporting the idea.[12]

Replication[edit]
Pandoraviruses have double stranded DNA. Like most giant viruses, Pandoraviruses have a viral replication cycle. They lack the ability to make their own proteins, rely on the host cells for ATP (energy) and replication, and also do not contain ribosomes or produce energy to divide. Under the microscope, scientists observed the virus enter the amoeba through fusion with membrane vacuoles, and integrate their DNA into the host cells. The host cell replicates the viral particles and eventually splits open, releasing the viral particles. The process of replication lasts 10–15 hours.[13] Viral replication and assembly happens simultaneously. In other words, viral DNA is replicated within the cytoplasm of the host cell and assembled into new viral particles followed by lysis of the host cell.[14]

Prevalence in the environment[edit]
Pandoraviruses do not seem to be harmful to humans. They are mostly found in marine environments, infecting amoebae. One reason for their only relatively recent discovery is because they exist in environments that are not well studied.  Pandoraviruses, like other marine viruses, infect plankton, which are organisms that live in the water column and form the basis of the food chain for other marine species. More study and research needs to be done in order to confirm the prevalence of Pandoraviruses in different environments. Currently, not much is known about their role in marine ecosystems. however, viruses are not mere pathogens for their host, but are also key players in aquatic ecosystems and the biosphere. Almost all genomes of cellular organisms contain viral sequences, elements of which are also essential in gene regulation. Viral infection and lysis can influence community structure, as well as the transfer of matter and energy in aquatic ecosystems. They can also dramatically alter host physiology through viral gene expression and drive evolutionary innovation through virus-mediated horizontal gene transfer.[15]

Phylogenetic affinities[edit]
Approximately 93% of Pandoravirus genes are not known from any other microbes,[16] suggesting that they belong to an as of yet undescribed ""fourth domain"" aside from Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes.[16] Viruses are not widely considered to belong within these three domains, although they have been proposed as one in the past by some biologists.[17]

Comparison with other giant viruses[edit]
Other giant viruses such as the Mimivirus, Pithovirus, and Megavirus have much smaller genomes. For example, Mimivirus, considered one of the largest giant viruses, has a genome size of 1.1 million base pairs compared to 2.5 million base pairs for Pandoraviruses.  Another feature that is different in Pandoraviruses compared to other giant viruses is the replication cycle. Pandoraviruses infect amoebas, which are single celled eukaryotes.[18] Pandoravirus enters amoebas through phagocytic vacuoles, then fuses with the membrane vacuole of the amoeba. This leads to viral particles to be released into the cytoplasm of the amoeba.[19]

What is the James Webb Space Telescope?,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope that is being developed and operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The telescope is named after James Webb, who was a prominent astronomer and the first head of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

The JWST is being launched on an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana on December 24, 2021. The launch is scheduled for 19:20 UTC, which is 12:20 PM EST, on December 22, 2021.

The JWST is being built to study the universe in unprecedented detail, with a primary objective of studying the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. The telescope is equipped with a suite of instruments that will allow it to study objects at different distances and in different wavelengths of light.

One of the key instruments on the JWST is the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which will be used to study objects in the near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. NIRCam will be able to observe objects at different distances, from the nearby universe to the most distant galaxies.

Another key instrument on the JWST is the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), which will be used to study objects in the mid-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. MIRI will be able to observe objects at different distances, from the nearby universe to the most distant galaxies.

The JWST will also be equipped with a Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSpec), which will be used to study objects in the near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. NIRSpec will be able to observe objects at different distances, from the nearby universe to the most distant galaxies.

The JWST will also be equipped with a Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS), which will be used to help the telescope aim at its targets. The FGS will be able to track objects as small as 100 meters across.

The JWST will be able to observe objects at different distances, from the nearby universe to the most distant galaxies. The telescope will be able to observe objects in the near-infrared, mid-infrared, and far-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The JWST will be able to study objects at different distances, from the nearby universe to the most distant galaxies. The telescope will be able to study objects at different distances, from the nearby universe to the most distant galaxies. The telescope will be able to study objects at different distances, from the nearby universe to the most distant galaxies.

In addition to its scientific objectives, the JWST will also be able to study the Earth's atmosphere and the effects of space radiation on spacecraft. The telescope will be able to study the Earth's atmosphere and the effects of space radiation on spacecraft.",True,https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/,"

Webb Maps Full Picture of How Phoenix Galaxy Cluster Forms Stars



Researchers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have finally solved the mystery of how a massive galaxy cluster is forming stars at such a high rate. The confirmation from Webb builds on more than a decade of studies using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope, as well as several ground-based observatories.
The Phoenix cluster, a grouping of galaxies bound together by gravity 5.8 billion light-years from Earth, has been a target of interest for astronomers due to a few unique properties. In particular, ones that are surprising: a suspected extreme cooling of gas and a furious star formation rate despite a roughly 10 billion solar mass supermassive black hole at its core. In other observed galaxy clusters, the central supermassive black hole powers energetic particles and radiation that prevents gas from cooling enough to form stars. Researchers have been studying gas flows within this cluster to try to understand how it is driving such extreme star formation.

Webb’s powerful sensitivity in the mid-infrared detected the cooling gas that leads to a furious rate of star formation in this massive galaxy cluster.Credit: NASA, CXC, NRAO, ESA, M.

What is the Shamoon virus?,"The Shamoon virus is a highly destructive malware that was first discovered in 2012. It was named after the Saudi Arabian company, Shamoon Technologies, which was believed to be the source of the virus.

The Shamoon virus is a type of ransomware that encrypts files on a computer system and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. It is believed to have been developed by a group of hackers who were disgruntled with the company they worked for.

The Shamoon virus is known to have caused significant damage to several companies and organizations around the world. In one notable incident, the virus was used to target the Saudi Aramco oil company in 2012, causing an estimated $6 billion in damages.

The Shamoon virus was first discovered in 2012 and has been linked to several other attacks since then. It is believed that the virus has been used by a number of different groups of hackers, including state-sponsored cybercriminals.

The Shamoon virus is known to have spread through a number of different methods, including email attachments, removable storage devices, and through social engineering tactics such as phishing attacks.

There is no known cure for the Shamoon virus, and once a computer system has been infected, the only way to recover the data is to pay the ransom to the hackers.

The Shamoon virus is a reminder of the increasing threat of cybercrime and the need for organizations to take steps to protect themselves against attack.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamoon,"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Modular computer virus
For the apostle of Jesus, see Shamoon al-Safa. For the actor, see Shamoon Abbasi.
Shamoon[a] (Persian: شمعون), also known as W32.DistTrack,[1] is a modular computer virus that was discovered in 2012, targeting then-recent 32-bit NT kernel versions of Microsoft Windows. The virus was notable due to the destructive nature of the attack and the cost of recovery. Shamoon can spread from an infected machine to other computers on the network. Once a system is infected, the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system, upload them to the attacker, and erase them. Finally the virus overwrites the master boot record of the infected computer, making it unusable.[2][3]
The virus was used for cyberwarfare[4] against national oil companies including Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco and Qatar's RasGas.[5][2][6] A group named ""Cutting Sword of Justice"" claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend more than a week restoring their services.[7] The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack.[8] Computer systems at RasGas were also knocked offline by an unidentified computer virus, with some security experts attributing the damage to Shamoon.[9] It was later described as the ""biggest hack in history"".[3]
Symantec, Kaspersky Lab,[10] and Seculert announced discovery of the malware on 16 August 2012.[2][11] Kaspersky Lab and Seculert found similarities between Shamoon and the Flame malware.[10][11] Shamoon made a surprise comeback in November 2016,[12] January 2017,[13] and December 2018.[14]


Design[edit]
Shamoon was designed to erase and overwrite hard drive data with a corrupted image and report the addresses of infected computers back to the computer inside the company's network.[15] The malware had a logic bomb which triggered the master boot record and data wiping payload at 11:08 am local time on Wednesday, August 15. The attack occurred during the month of Ramadan in 2012. It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone on holiday reducing the chance of discovery before maximum damage could be caused, hampering recovery.
The virus consisted of three components, the Dropper, the Wiper and the Reporter. The Dropper, the source of the infection, creates a service with the name 'NtsSrv' that enables it to remain persistent on the infected computer. The Dropper was built in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If the 32-bit dropper detects a 64-bit architecture, it drops the 64-bit version. This component drops the Wiper and the Reporter onto the infected computer and executes itself. It spreads across a local network by copying itself to network shares and on to other computers.[16]
The Wiper component utilizes an Eldos-produced driver known as RawDisk to achieve direct user-mode access to a hard drive without using Windows APIs. It identifies the locations of all files on the infected computers and erases them. It sends information about the files destroyed to the attacker and then overwrites the erased files with corrupted data so they cannot be recovered. The component used portions of an image. In the 2012 attack it used an image of a burning U.S. flag; in the 2016 attack it used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi.[17][18][12]

Before the attack[edit]
The malware was unique, used to target the Saudi government by causing destruction to the state-owned national oil company Saudi Aramco. The attackers posted a pastie on Pastebin hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing ""oppression"" and the Saudi government as a reason behind the attack.[19] According to Chris Kubecka, a security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas, the attack was well-staged.[3] It was initiated by a phishing email attack that an unnamed Saudi Aramco Information Technology employee opened, giving the group entry into the company's network around mid-2012.[20]

We, behalf of an anti-oppression hacker group that have been fed up of crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world, especially in the neighboring countries such as Syria, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt and ..., and also of dual approach of the world community to these nations, want to hit the main supporters of these disasters by this action. One of the main supporters of this disasters [sic] is Al-Saud corrupt regime that sponsors such oppressive measures by using Muslims oil resources. Al-Saud is a partner in committing these crimes. It's [sic] hands are infected with the blood of innocent children and people. In the first step, an action was performed against Aramco company, as the largest financial source for Al-Saud regime. In this step, we penetrated a system of Aramco company by using the hacked systems in several countries and then sent a malicious virus to destroy thirty thousand computers networked in this company. The destruction operations began on Wednesday, Aug 15, 2012 at 11:08 AM (Local time in Saudi Arabia) and will be completed within a few hours.[21]
Pastie announcing attack against Saudi Aramco by a group called Cutting Sword of Justice
Kubecka described in a Black Hat USA talk that Saudi Aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ICS control network, leaving the business network at risk for a major incident.[20]

During the attack[edit]
On 15 August at 11:08 am local time, over 30,000 Windows based systems began to be overwritten. Symantec found some of the affected systems showed an image of an American flag while their data was being deleted and overwritten.[2] Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to hacked business systems still inoperable.

""Saudi Aramco has restored all its main internal network services that were impacted on August 15, 2012, by a malicious virus that originated from external sources and affected about 30,000 workstations. The workstations have since been cleaned and restored to service. As a precaution, remote Internet access to online resources was restricted. Saudi Aramco employees returned to work August 25, 2012, following the Eid holidays, resuming normal business. The company confirmed that its primary enterprise systems of hydrocarbon exploration and production were unaffected as they operate on isolated network systems. Production plants were also fully operational as these control systems are also isolated.""
On August 29, 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for Aramco CEO Khalid Al-Falih.[22] The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie:

""mon 29th aug, good day, SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~/reversed
We think it's funny and weird that there are no news coming out from Saudi Aramco regarding Saturday's night. well, we expect that but just to make it more clear and prove that we're done with we promised, just read the following facts -valuable ones- about the company's systems:
- internet service routers are three and their info as follows:

Core router:   SA-AR-CO-1#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-bl
Backup router: SA-AR-CO-3#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-bl
Middle router: SA-AR-CO-2#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-bl
- Khalid A. Al-Falih, CEO, email info as follows:

Khalid.falih@aramco.com      password:kal@ram@sa1960
- security appliances used:

Cisco ASA    #    McAfee #   FireEye :
default passwords for all!!!!!!!!!!
We think and truly believe that our mission is done and we need no more time to waste. I guess it's time for SA to yell and release something to the public. however, silence is no solution.
I hope you enjoyed that. and wait our final paste regarding SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~

angry internet lovers #SH""
According to Kubecka, in order to restore operations, Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By September 1, 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the August 15th attack. RasGas was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.[20]
It is unclear why the attacker may have an interest in actually destroying the infected PC. Kaspersky Labs hinted that the 900 KB malware could be related to Wiper, that was used in a cyber attack on Iran in April. After a 2-day analysis, the company erroneously concluded that the malware is more likely to come from ""scriptkiddies"" who were inspired by Wiper.[23] Later, in a blog post, Eugene Kaspersky clarified the use of Shamoon categorizing as cyberwarfare.[24]

What is the purpose of the H-1B visa program?,"The H-1B visa program is a U.S. immigration program that allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire foreign workers with specialized knowledge or skills in a high-skilled occupation. The program is administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and is intended to fill labor shortages in certain industries and to promote economic growth in the United States.

Here are some specific details and examples of the H-1B visa program:

* In recent years, the H-1B program has been heavily criticized for its use as a means to circumvent U.S. immigration laws and for its perceived impact on the U.S. economy.
* In 2015, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that it would cap the number of H-1B visas that could be issued each year at 65,000, up from the previous cap of 18,000.
* In 2016, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it would begin processing H-1B applications on a first-come, first-served basis, rather than on a first-to-file basis as had been previously done.
* In 2017, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced that it would require employers to pay the prevailing wage for the occupation for which they are hiring an H-1B worker.
* In 2018, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced that it would require employers to provide evidence that they have performed a labor condition application (LCA) and that the wages paid to H-1B workers are not less than the prevailing wage for the occupation.
* In 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that it would begin requiring employers to submit evidence that they have performed an LCA before they can file an H-1B petition.

Overall, the H-1B visa program is intended to provide a legal pathway for foreign workers to come to the United States and fill critical labor shortages in certain industries. However, the program has also been criticized for its potential impact on the U.S. economy and for its perceived impact on U.S. immigration laws.",False,https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b,"

H-1B Program


H-2A: Temporary Agricultural Employment of Foreign Workers


H-2B Program


U and T Visa Certifications














 
OverviewThe H-1B program applies to employers seeking to hire nonimmigrant aliens as workers in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability. A specialty occupation is one that requires the application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and the attainment of at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent. The intent of the H-1B provisions is to help employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the U.S. workforce by authorizing the temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not otherwise authorized to work in the United States.The law establishes certain standards in order to protect similarly employed U.S. workers from being adversely affected by the employment of the nonimmigrant workers, as well as to protect the H-1B nonimmigrant workers. Employers must attest to the Department of Labor that they will pay wages to the H-1B nonimmigrant workers that are at least equal to the actual wage paid by the employer to other workers with similar experience and qualifications for the job in question, or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment – whichever is greater.Key NewsOn January 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) issued an Office of Foreign Labor Certification H-1B Program Bulletin and a Wage and Hour Division Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) revising its interpretation of its regulations concerning which employers of H-1B workers must file Labor Condition Applications.  The Department simultaneously submitted a Notice for publication in the Federal Register announcing and requesting public comments on this interpretation.  On January 20, 2021, the Department withdrew its Notice from the Office of the Federal Register prior to its publication, and is now withdrawing the Bulletin and FAB for the purpose of considering the process for issuing this interpretation as well as reviewing related issues of law, fact, and policy.  Accordingly, the requirements of the Bulletin and FAB are no longer in effect.  The Department will notify the public of any further actions as appropriate once it completes its review. General GuidanceField Assistance Bulletin 2019-3: Compliance with the H-1B Notice Requirement by Electronic Posting (PDF)Employment Law Guide: Workers in Professional and Specialty Occupations (H-1B and H-1B1 Visas)Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Prevailing Wage Determinations for Nonagricultural ProgramsWages under Foreign Labor CertificationH-1B Workers Rights CardH-1B PresentationThe Employment of Non-Immigrants on H-1B Visas (Microsoft® PowerPoint®)FormsNew Labor Condition Application (Form ETA 9035) with InstructionsWH-4, H-1B Nonimmigrant Information FormFact SheetsH-1B Fact Sheets - Numerical IndexDisqualified and Willful Violator EmployersDOL maintains a list of individuals or corporations who, as a result of an H-1B investigation/final agency action, have been disqualified from approval of petitions to participate in the nonimmigrant program.

"
Who was Ötzi the Iceman?,"Ötzi the Iceman was a well-preserved male iceman who was discovered in the Ötztal Alps in the Italian-Austrian border region in 1991. He was estimated to have died around 5,300 years ago.

Ötzi was a hunter-gatherer, and he lived in the Alps during the Copper Age, which lasted from around 4,000 to 2,000 BCE. He was found in a glacier in the Ötztal Alps, which is a remote and rugged area in the Italian-Austrian border region.

Ötzi was discovered by a team of researchers who were using a helicopter to survey the area. They found a set of footprints in the snow that led to a larger area of ice. They followed the footprints for several hours until they reached the body of Ötzi.

Ötzi was well-preserved, and his body was found in a sitting position with his arms folded across his chest. He was wearing a leather belt with a quiver of arrows and a knife, as well as a leather pouch around his waist.

Ötzi was estimated to be around 45 years old at the time of his death, and he was around 5'9"" tall. He was covered in tattoos, which were made with red ochre, and he had a scar on his forehead that was caused by a blow from a stone.

Ötzi was found with a number of items that were typical of his time period, such as a copper axe, a copper knife, and a copper arrowhead. He was also found with a number of items that were not typical of his time period, such as a copper pot and a copper belt buckle.

Ötzi's body was found in a glacier, and he was estimated to have died around 5,300 years ago. He was buried in the glacier, and he was covered in ice and snow for thousands of years.

The discovery of Ötzi the Iceman was a major event in the field of archaeology, and it has provided valuable insights into the life and culture of the Copper Age people. The discovery of Ötzi has also raised important questions about the environment and the climate of the time period in which he lived, and it has helped to shed light on the lives of the people who lived in the Alps during that time period.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi,"

Natural mummy of a man who lived c. 3300 BC
For other uses, see Ötzi (disambiguation).

Ötzi, also called The Iceman, is the natural mummy of a man who lived between 3350 and 3105 BC. Ötzi's remains were discovered on 19 September 1991, in the Ötztal Alps (hence the nickname ""Ötzi"", German: [œtsi]) at the Austria–Italy border. He is Europe's oldest known natural human mummy, offering an unprecedented view of Chalcolithic (Copper Age) Europeans.
Because of the presence of an arrowhead embedded in his left shoulder and various other wounds, researchers believe that Ötzi was killed by another person. The nature of his life and the circumstances of his death are the subject of much investigation and speculation. His remains and personal belongings are on exhibit at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, South Tyrol, Italy.


Discovery
class=notpageimage| Discovery site marked on a map of the Alps
Ötzi was found on 19 September 1991 by two German tourists, at an elevation of 3,210 m (10,530 ft) on the east ridge of the Fineilspitze in the Ötztal Alps on the Austrian–Italian border, near Similaun mountain and the Tisenjoch pass. When the tourists, Helmut and Erika Simon, first saw the body, they both believed that they had happened upon a recently deceased mountaineer.[3] The next day, a mountain gendarme and the keeper of the nearby Similaunhütte first attempted to remove the body, which was frozen in ice below the torso, using a pneumatic drill and ice axes, but bad weather forced them to give up. Within a short time, eight groups visited the site, among whom were mountaineers Hans Kammerlander and Reinhold Messner.
The body was extracted on 22 September and salvaged the following day. It was transported to the office of the medical examiner in Innsbruck, together with other objects found nearby. On 24 September, the find was examined there by archaeologist Konrad Spindler of the University of Innsbruck. He dated the find to be ""at least four thousand years old"" on the basis of the typology of an axe among the retrieved objects.[4][5] Tissue samples from the corpse and other accompanying materials were later analyzed at several scientific institutions and their results unequivocally concluded that the remains belonged to someone who had lived between 3359 and 3105 BC, or some 5,000 years ago.[5] More specific estimates find that there was a 66% chance he died between 3239 and 3105 BC, a 33% chance he died between 3359 and 3294 BC, and a 1% chance he died between 3277 and 3268 BC.[6]

Border dispute
At the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1919, the border between North and South Tyrol was defined as the watershed of the rivers Inn and Etsch. Near Tisenjoch, the glacier (which has since retreated) complicated establishing the watershed and the border was drawn too far north. Although Ötzi's find site drains to the Austrian side, land surveys in October 1991 ultimately proved that the body had been located 92.56 m (101.22 yd) inside Italian territory, which was in consonance with Italy's original 1919 ownership claim.[7]
The province of South Tyrol claimed property rights but agreed to let Innsbruck University finish its scientific examinations. Since 1998, he has been on display at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, the capital of South Tyrol.[8]

Scientific analyses
The corpse has been extensively examined, measured, X-rayed, and dated. Tissues and intestinal contents have been examined microscopically, as have the items found with the body. In August 2004, frozen bodies of three Austro-Hungarian soldiers killed during the Battle of San Matteo (1918) were found on the mountain Punta San Matteo in Trentino. One body was sent to a museum in the hope that research on how the environment had affected its preservation would help unravel Ötzi's past.[9]

Body
Ötzi the Iceman, while still frozen in the glacier, photographed by Helmut Simon upon the discovery of the body in September 1991
By the most recent estimates, at the time of his death, Ötzi was 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall, weighed about 50 kg (110 lb), and was about 45 years of age.[10][11] When his body was found, it weighed 13.750 kg (30 lb 5.0 oz).[12][13] Because the body was covered in ice shortly after his death, it had only partially deteriorated. Initial reports claimed that his penis and most of his scrotum were missing, but this was later shown to be unfounded.[14] Analysis of pollen, dust grains and the isotopic composition of his tooth enamel indicates that he spent his childhood near the present South Tyrol village of Feldthurns, north of Bolzano, but later went to live in valleys about 50 kilometres (31 mi) farther north.[15]
In 2009, a CAT scan revealed that the stomach had shifted upward to where his lower lung area would normally be. Analysis of the contents revealed the partly digested remains of ibex meat, confirmed by DNA analysis, suggesting he had had a meal less than two hours before his death. Wheat grains were also found.[16] It is believed that Ötzi most likely had a few slices of a dried, fatty meat, which came from a wild goat in South Tyrol, Italy.[17] Analysis of Ötzi's intestinal contents showed two meals (the last one consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, the other of red deer and herb bread; both were eaten with roots and fruits. The grain also eaten with both meals was a highly processed einkorn wheat bran,[18] quite possibly eaten in the form of bread. In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plum-like fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild.[19]
Hair analysis was used to examine his diet from several months before. Pollen in the first meal showed that it had been consumed in a mid-altitude conifer forest, and other pollens indicated the presence of wheat and legumes, which may have been domesticated crops. Pollen grains of hop-hornbeam were also discovered. The pollen was very well preserved, with the cells inside remaining intact, indicating that it had been fresh (estimated about two hours old) at the time of Ötzi's death, which places the event in the spring or early summer. Einkorn wheat is harvested in the late summer, and sloes in the autumn; these must have been stored from the previous year.[20]
High levels of both copper particles and arsenic were found in Ötzi's hair. This, along with Ötzi's copper axe blade, which is 99.7% pure copper, has led scientists to speculate that Ötzi was involved in copper smelting.[21]
By examination of the proportions of Ötzi's tibia, femur and pelvis, it was postulated that Ötzi's lifestyle included long walks over hilly terrain. This degree of mobility is not characteristic of other Copper Age Europeans. This may indicate that Ötzi was a high-altitude shepherd.[22]
Using modern 3D scanning technology, a facial reconstruction has been created for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. It shows Ötzi looking old for his 45 years, with deep-set brown eyes, a beard, a furrowed face, and sunken cheeks. He is depicted as looking tired and ungroomed.[23]

Health
Ötzi apparently had Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), an intestinal parasite. During CT scans, it was observed that three or four of his right ribs had been cracked when he had been lying face down after death, or where the ice had crushed his body. One of his fingernails (of the two found) shows three Beau's lines, indicating he was sick three times in the six months before he died. The last incident, two months before he died, lasted about two weeks.[24] It was also found that his epidermis, the outer skin layer, was missing, a natural process from his mummification in ice.[25] Ötzi's teeth showed considerable internal deterioration from cavities. These oral pathologies may have been brought about by his grain-heavy, high-carbohydrate diet.[26] DNA analysis in February 2012 revealed that Ötzi was lactose intolerant, supporting the theory that lactose intolerance was still common at that time, despite the increasing spread of agriculture and dairying.[27] Ötzi's lungs were examined endoscopically and were found to be blackened by soot, probably due to his frequent proximity to open fires for warmth and cooking.[28][29][30]

Skeletal details and tattooing
Ötzi had a total of 61 tattoos, consisting of 19 groups of black lines ranging from 1–3 mm (0.039–0.118 in) in width and 7–40 mm (0.28–1.57 in) in length.[31] These include groups of parallel lines running along the longitudinal axis of his body and to both sides of the lumbar spine, as well as a cruciform mark behind the right knee and on the right ankle, and parallel lines around the left wrist. The greatest concentration of markings is found on his legs, which together exhibit 12 groups of lines.[32] A microscopic examination of samples collected from these tattoos revealed that they were created from pigment manufactured out of fireplace ash or soot.[33] This pigment was then rubbed into small linear incisions or punctures.[34] It has been suggested that Ötzi was repeatedly tattooed in the same locations, since the majority of them are quite dark.[34]
Radiological examination of Ötzi's bones showed ""age-conditioned or strain-induced degeneration"" corresponding to many tattooed areas, including osteochondrosis and slight spondylosis in the lumbar spine and wear-and-tear degeneration in the knee and especially in the ankle joints.[35] It has been speculated that these tattoos may have been part of pain relief treatments similar to acupressure or acupuncture,[32] though Ötzi lived at least 2,000 years before their previously known earliest use in China (c. 1000 BC).[36] For example, 9 of the 19 groups of his tattoos are located next to, or directly on, acupunctural areas used today, and most of the others are on meridians and other acupunctural regions of the body and over arthritic joints. Ötzi's abdominal tattoos may have assuaged the intestinal pain of whipworm, which he is thought to have had.[34][37]
At one point, it was thought that Ötzi was the oldest tattooed human mummy yet discovered.[38][39] In 2018, however, tattoos were discovered on nearly contemporaneous Egyptian mummies.[40]
Many of Ötzi's tattoos originally went unnoticed, since they are difficult to see with the naked eye. In 2015, researchers photographed the body using noninvasive multispectral techniques to capture images on different light wavelengths that are imperceptible by humans, revealing the remainder of his tattoos.[34][37]

Clothes and shoes
Archeoparc (Schnals valley / South Tyrol). Museum: Reconstruction of the neolithic clothes worn by Ötzi
Ötzi wore a cloak made of woven grass[41] and a coat, a belt, a pair of leggings, a loincloth, and shoes, all made of leather of different skins. He also wore a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. The shoes were waterproof and wide, seemingly designed for walking across the snow; they were constructed using bearskin for the soles, deer hide for the top panels, and a netting made of tree bark. Soft grass went around the foot and in the shoe and functioned like modern socks. The coat, belt, leggings and loincloth were constructed of vertical strips of leather sewn together with sinew. His belt had a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a scraper, a drill, a flint flake, a bone awl and a dried fungus (see #Tools and equipment below).[42]

A replica of Ötzi's shoe at the Bata Shoe Museum
The shoes have since been reproduced by a Czech academic, who said that ""because the shoes are actually quite complex, I'm convinced that even 5,300 years ago, people had the equivalent of a cobbler who made shoes for other people"". The reproductions were found to constitute such excellent footwear that it was reported that a Czech company offered to purchase the rights to sell them.[43] However, a more recent hypothesis by British archaeologist Jacqui Wood is that Ötzi's shoes were actually the upper part of snowshoes. According to this theory, the item currently interpreted as part of a backpack is actually the wood frame and netting of one snowshoe and animal hide to cover the face.[44]
The leather loincloth and hide coat were made from sheepskin. Genetic analysis showed that the sheep species was nearer to modern domestic European sheep than to wild sheep; the items were made from the skins of at least four animals. Part of the coat was made from a domesticated goat belonging to a mitochondrial haplogroup (a common female ancestor) that inhabits central Europe today. The coat was made from several animals from two different species and was stitched together using hides. The leggings were made from domesticated goat leather.[45] A similar set of 5,000-year-old leggings discovered in Schnidejoch, Switzerland, were made from goat leather as well.[46]
Irish and Italian researchers were able to undertake an analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from six different items of the body's clothing and published their findings in the journal Scientific Reports. These showed that the shoelaces were made from the European genetic population of cattle. The quiver was made from wild roe deer, the fur hat was made from a genetic lineage of brown bear which lives in the region today.[47][48][49]

Tools and equipment

The arrows were found in a quiver with what is presumed to be a bow string, an unidentified tool, and an antler tool which might have been used for sharpening arrow points.[53] There was also an unfinished yew longbow that was 1.82 m (72 in) long.[54]
A replica of Ötzi's copper axe
In addition, among Ötzi's possessions were berries, two birch bark baskets, and two species of polypore mushrooms with leather strings through them. One of these, the birch fungus, is known to have anthelmintic properties, and was probably used for medicinal purposes.[55] The other was a type of tinder fungus, included with part of what appeared to be a complex firelighting kit. The kit featured pieces of over a dozen different plants, in addition to flint and pyrite for creating sparks.
Ötzi's copper axe was of particular interest. His axe's haft is 60 cm (24 in) long and made from carefully worked yew with a right-angled crook at the shoulder, leading to the blade. The 9.5-centimetre-long (3.7 in) axe head is made of almost pure copper.[56] It was produced through casting and did not undergo mechanical hardening. Despite the fact that copper ore sources in the Alpines are known to have been exploited at the time, a 2017 study indicated that the copper in the axe came from southern Tuscany.[57] It was let into the forked end of the crook and fixed there using birch-tar and tight leather lashing. The blade part of the head extends out of the lashing and shows clear signs of having been used to chop and cut. At the time, such an axe would have been a valuable possession, important both as a tool and as a status symbol for the bearer.[56]

Genetic analysis
Ötzi's full genome was first sequenced in 2012;[58] a new, high-coverage genome with much less modern human contamination was published in 2023.[59]
According to the 2012 study, the Y chromosome DNA of Ötzi belongs to a subclade of G defined by the SNPs M201, P287, P15, L223 and L91 (G-L91, ISOGG G2a2b, former ""G2a4""). He was not typed for any of the subclades downstreaming from G-L91; however, an analysis of his Binary Alignment Map file revealed that he belongs to the L166 and FGC5672 subclades below L91.[60] G-L91 is now mostly found in South Corsica.[61] Analysis of his mitochondrial DNA showed that Ötzi belongs to the K1 subclade, but cannot be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade (K1a, K1b, or K1c). The new subclade has provisionally been named K1ö for Ötzi.[62] A multiplex assay study was able to confirm that the Iceman's mtDNA belongs to a previously unknown European mtDNA clade with a very limited distribution among modern data sets.[63] By autosomal DNA, Ötzi is most closely related to Southern Europeans, especially to geographically isolated populations like Corsicans and Sardinians.[64][65][66][67] Ötzi traced the majority of his ancestry to the Neolithic early European farmers who migrated from Anatolia to Europe beginning during the 7th millennium BC, replacing earlier European hunter-gatherers as dominant population.[68] DNA analysis also showed him at high risk of atherosclerosis and lactose intolerance, with the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi, possibly making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease.[58][69] A later analysis suggested the sequence may have been a different Borrelia species.[70]
The 2023 study on Ötzi's genome found a very high proportion (90%) of Anatolian farmer-related ancestry – in fact, the highest among European populations of the same time—with a lesser contribution from  European hunter-gatherer-related ancestry, but (in contrast to the 2012 research) no evidence of Steppe-related ancestry,[71] the disagreement with previous results being attributed to modern human contamination. 
While the absence in Ötzi's genome of genetic components from Western Steppe Herders (WSH) is not surprising because these ""Proto-Indo-European"" populations did not arrive in Europe until about 2900 BC, the unusually low contribution from the Western Hunter Gatherers was explained by positing that the genetic mixing between neolithic farmers originating from Anatolia and WHG was still an ongoing process. Also, examining the genetic sites involved in phenotypical traits, the authors concluded that the Iceman, among other things, had likely darker skin than present-day Europeans, but not as dark as the Mesolithic Western Hunter-Gatherers, was likely affected by baldness, and may have suffered from obesity-related metabolic disorders. The article also leaves room for environmental factors as indicative of their darker skin complexion, so more studies will be necessary in the future.[71]
In October 2013, it was reported that 19 modern Tyrolean men belong to the same paternal lineage (Y-DNA haplogroup G-L91) as Ötzi, and may share a common ancestor with Ötzi, and/or descend from close relatives of Ötzi. Scientists from the Institute of Legal Medicine at Innsbruck Medical University had analysed the DNA of over 3,700 Tyrolean male blood donors and found 19 (c. 0.5%) who shared the same paternal haplogroup with the 5,300-year-old man.[72][73]

Blood
In May 2012, scientists announced the discovery that Ötzi still had intact blood cells. These are the oldest complete human blood cells ever identified. In most bodies this old, the blood cells are either shrunken or mere remnants, but Ötzi's have the same dimensions as living red blood cells and resemble a modern-day sample.[74][75]

H. pylori analysis
In 2016, researchers reported on a study from the extraction of twelve samples from the gastrointestinal tract of Ötzi to analyze the origins of the Helicobacter pylori in his gut.[76] The H. pylori strain found in his gastrointestinal tract was, surprisingly, the hpAsia2 strain, a strain today found primarily in South Asian and Central Asian populations, with extremely rare occurrences in modern European populations.[76]  The strain found in Ötzi's gut is most similar to three modern individuals from Northern India; the strain itself is, of course, older than the modern Northern Indian strain.[76]

Stomach
Ötzi's stomach was completely full and its contents were mostly undigested. In 2018, researchers performed a thorough analysis of his stomach and intestines to gain insights on Chalcolithic meal composition and dietary habits. Biopsies were performed on the stomach to obtain dietary information in the time leading up to his death, and the contents themselves were also analyzed. Previously, Ötzi was believed to be vegetarian, but during this study, it was revealed that his diet was omnivorous. The presence of certain compounds suggests what kinds of food he generally ate, such as gamma-terpinene, implying the intake of herbs, and several nutritious minerals indicating red meat or dairy consumption. Through analysis of DNA and protein traces, the researchers were able to identify the contents of Ötzi's last meal, composed of fat and meat from ibex and red deer as well as einkorn wheat. The results of atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy analysis reveal that he consumed fresh or dried wild meat. A previous study detected charcoal particles in his lower intestine, which indicate that fire was present during some part of the food preparation process, but it was likely used in drying out the meat or smoking it.[77][78]

Cause of death
Reconstructions of Ötzi's last days, based on his last itinerary and meals, the state of his wounds, the causes of his death and the damaged and insufficient equipment, following multiple studies
The cause of death remained uncertain until 10 years after the discovery of the body.[79] It was initially believed that Ötzi died from exposure during a winter storm. Later it was speculated that he may have been a victim of a ritual sacrifice, perhaps for being a chieftain.[80][81] This explanation was inspired by theories previously advanced for the bodies recovered from peat bogs such as the Tollund Man and the Lindow Man.[81]

Arrowhead and blood analyses
In 2001, X-rays and a CT scan revealed that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder when he died[82] and a matching small tear on his coat.[83] The discovery of the arrowhead prompted researchers to theorize Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which would probably have been fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available.[84] Further research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest and cerebral trauma indicative of a blow to the head. One of the cuts, to the base of his thumb, reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death. Currently, it is believed that Ötzi bled to death after the arrow shattered the scapula and damaged nerves and blood vessels before lodging near the lung.[85]
DNA analyses taken in 2003 are claimed to have revealed traces of blood from at least four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from a single arrowhead in his quiver, and a fourth from his coat.[86][87] Interpretations of these findings are that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow and was able to retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back.[83] Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a hypothesis that, before death occurred and rigor mortis set in, the Iceman was turned onto his belly in the effort to remove the arrow shaft.[88] The Cambridge World History of Violence (2020) cited Ötzi as evidence of prehistoric warfare.[89]

Alternative theory of death location
Most research has assumed that Ötzi died at roughly the spot where he was found.[90] In 2010, it was proposed that Ötzi died at a much lower altitude and was buried higher in the mountains, as posited by archaeologist Alessandro Vanzetti of the Sapienza University of Rome and his colleagues.[90] According to their study of the items found near Ötzi and their locations, the iceman may have been placed above what has been interpreted as a stone burial mound, but his body subsequently moved with each thaw cycle that created a flowing watery mixture driven by gravity before being re-frozen.[91] While archaeobotanist Klaus Oeggl of the University of Innsbruck agrees that the natural process described probably caused the body to move from the ridge that includes the stone formation, he pointed out that the paper provided no compelling evidence to demonstrate that the scattered stones constituted a burial platform.[91] Moreover, biological anthropologist Albert Zink argues that the iceman's bones display no dislocations that would have resulted from a downhill slide and that the intact blood clots in his arrow wound would show damage if the body had been moved up the mountain.[91] In either case, the burial theory does not contradict the likelihood of a violent cause of death.

Legal dispute
The Ötzi memorial near Tisenjoch. Ötzi was found about 70 m northeast of here, a place indicated with a red mark (not in this photo). The mountain in the background is the Fineilspitze.
Italian law entitled the Simons to a finders' fee from the South Tyrolean provincial government of 25% of the value of Ötzi. In 1994 the authorities offered a ""symbolic"" reward of lire 10 million (€5,200), which the Simons declined.[92] In 2003, the Simons filed a lawsuit which asked a court in Bolzano to recognize their role in Ötzi's discovery and declare them his ""official discoverers"". The court decided in the Simons' favour in November 2003, and at the end of December that year the Simons announced that they were seeking US$300,000 as their fee. The provincial government decided to appeal.[93]
In addition, two people came forward, each with a claim of being part of the same mountaineering party that had come across Ötzi and of discovering the body first:

Magdalena Mohar Jarc, a retired Slovenian climber, who alleged that she discovered the corpse first after falling into a crevice, and, shortly after returning to a mountain hut, asked Helmut Simon to take photographs of Ötzi. She cited Reinhold Messner, who was also present in the mountain hut, as the witness to this.[94]
Sandra Nemeth, from Switzerland, who contended that she had found the corpse before Helmut and Erika Simon and spat on it to make sure that her DNA would be found there later. She asked for a DNA test on the remains, but experts believed that there was little chance of finding any trace.[95]
In 2005, the rival claims were heard by a Bolzano court. The legal case angered Mrs. Simon, who alleged that neither woman was present on the mountain that day.[95] In 2005, Mrs. Simon's lawyer said: ""Mrs. Simon is very upset by all this and by the fact that these two new claimants have decided to appear 14 years after Ötzi was found.""[95] In 2008, however, Jarc stated for a Slovene newspaper that she had written twice to the Bolzano court in regard to her claim but received no reply whatsoever.[94]
In 2004, Helmut Simon died. Two years later, in June 2006, an appeals court affirmed that the Simons had indeed discovered the Iceman and were therefore entitled to a finder's fee. It also ruled that the provincial government had to pay the Simons' legal costs. After this ruling, Mrs. Erika Simon reduced her claim to €150,000. The provincial government's response was that the expenses it had incurred to establish a museum and the costs of preserving the Iceman should be considered in determining the finder's fee. It insisted it would pay no more than €50,000. In September 2006, the authorities appealed the case to Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation.[93]
On 29 September 2008, it was announced that the provincial government and Mrs. Simon had reached a settlement of the dispute, under which she would receive €150,000 in recognition of Ötzi's discovery by her and her late husband and the tourist income that it attracts.[92][96]

What happened during the Chernobyl disaster?,"The Chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukrainian SSR, part of the Soviet Union. The disaster was caused by a series of human errors, mechanical failures, and design flaws, and it remains one of the worst nuclear accidents in history.

Here are some specific details and examples of what happened during the Chernobyl disaster:

* Name of people:
	+ The Chief Operator of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Valery Legasov
	+ The Deputy Chief Operator, Anatoly Dyatlov
	+ The Chief Engineer, Vladimir Bystritsky
	+ The Chief Radiophysicist, Nikolai Fomin
* Number of people affected:
	+ Over 4,000 people were directly involved in the accident, including plant workers, emergency responders, and other personnel.
	+ Thousands of people in the surrounding area were exposed to radiation, and many more were affected by the disaster's aftermath.
* Events:
	+ The accident started when a control room operator mistakenly opened a valve that allowed coolant to escape from a reactor.
	+ The reactor's cooling system was unable to keep up with the loss of coolant, causing the reactor's temperature to rise rapidly.
	+ The reactor's cooling system was also unable to deal with the resulting increase in pressure, leading to a partial meltdown of the reactor's core.
	+ The accident was not detected until hours later, when workers realized that the reactor's cooling system was not functioning properly.
	+ The emergency responders and plant workers were unable to contain the fire and radiation leak, and the situation quickly escalated out of control.
* Locations:
	+ The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located in the Prypiat region of the Ukrainian SSR.
	+ The surrounding area, which was heavily contaminated with radiation and affected by the disaster's aftermath.
* Dates:
	+ The accident occurred on April 26, 1986.
	+ The disaster's aftermath continued for many years, with the last evacuation in 2000.
* Times:
	+ The accident started at around 1:23 pm local time.
	+ The emergency responders were unable to contain the fire and radiation leak until around 4:40 pm local time.
* Names of people involved:
	+ Valery Legasov
	+ Anatoly Dyatlov
	+ Vladimir Bystritsky
	+ Nikolai Fomin

These details and examples provide a comprehensive overview of the Chernobyl disaster and the events that unfolded on that fateful day. The disaster's aftermath continues to have significant impacts on the environment, human health, and the local population, and it remains a symbol of the dangers of nuclear power and the importance of safety measures.",True,https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl/faqs,"

Frequently Asked Chernobyl Questions










    1. What caused the Chernobyl accident?  
On April 26, 1986, the Number Four RBMK reactor at the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine, went out of control during a test at low-power, leading to an explosion and fire that demolished the reactor building and released large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere. Safety measures were ignored, the uranium fuel in the reactor overheated and melted through the protective barriers. RBMK reactors do not have what is known as a containment structure, a concrete and steel dome over the reactor itself designed to keep radiation inside the plant in the event of such an accident. Consequently, radioactive elements including plutonium, iodine, strontium and caesium were scattered over a wide area. In addition, the graphite blocks used as a moderating material in the RBMK caught fire at high temperature as air entered the reactor core, which contributed to emission of radioactive materials into the environment.







    2. How many people died as an immediate result of the accident?  
The initial explosion resulted in the death of two workers. Twenty-eight of the firemen and emergency clean-up workers died in the first three months after the explosion from Acute Radiation Sickness and one of cardiac arrest.







    3. How many people were evacuated?  
The entire town of Pripyat (population 49 360), which lay only three kilometres from the plant was completely evacuated 36 hours after the accident. During the subsequent weeks and months an additional 67 000 people were evacuated from their homes in contaminated areas and relocated on government order. In total some 200 000 people are believed to have been relocated as a result of the accident.







    4. What are the major health effects for exposed populations?  
There have been at least 1800 documented cases of thyroid cancer children who were between 0 and 14 years of age when the accident occurred., which is far higher than normal. The thyroid gland of young children is particularly susceptible to the uptake of radioactive iodine, which can trigger cancers, treatable both by surgery and medication. Health studies of the registered cleanup workers called in (so-called “liquidators”) have failed to show any direct correlation between their radiation exposure and an increase in other forms of cancer or disease. The psychological affects of Chernobyl were and remain widespread and profound, and have resulted for instance in suicides, drinking problems and apathy.







    5. What radioactive elements were emitted into the environment?  
There were over 100 radioactive elements released into the atmosphere when Chernobyl’s fourth reactor exploded. Most of these were short lived and decayed (reduced in radioactivity) very quickly. Iodine, strontium and caesium were the most dangerous of the elements released, and have half-lives of 8 days, 29 years, and 30 years respectively. The isotopes Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 are therefore still present in the area to this day. While iodine is linked to thyroid cancer, Strontium can lead to leukaemia. Caesium is the element that travelled the farthest and lasts the longest. This element affects the entire body and especially can harm the liver and spleen.







    6. How large an area was affected by the radioactive fallout?  
Some 150,000 square kilometres in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine are contaminated and stretch northward of the plant site as far as 500 kilometres. An area spanning 30 kilometres around the plant is considered the “exclusion zone” and is essentially uninhabited. Radioactive fallout scattered over much of the northern hemisphere via wind and storm patterns, but the amounts dispersed were in many instances insignificant.







    7. How was this area cleaned up after the accident?  
Emergency workers (liquidators) were drafted into the area and helped to clean up the plant premises and the surrounding area. These workers were mostly plant employees, Ukrainian fire-fighters plus many soldiers and miners from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and other parts of the former Soviet Union. The exact number of liquidators is unknown because there are no completely accurate records of the people involved in the clean-up. The Russian registries list approximately 400,000 liquidators as of 1991 and approximately 600,000 people were granted the status of “liquidator”. These 600,000 individuals received special benefits because of their involvement, on- and off-site, in tackling the accident’s aftermath.The duties of the liquidators varied. They worked on decontamination and major construction projects, including the establishment of settlements and towns for plant workers and evacuees. They also built waste repositories, dams, water filtration systems and the “sarcophagus”, which entombs the entire fourth reactor to contain the remaining radioactive material.







    8. Was the rest of Europe/the world affected?  
Scandinavian countries and other parts of the world were affected by the radioactive releases from Chernobyl. Caesium and other radioactive isotopes were blown by wind northward into Sweden and Finland and over other parts of the northern hemisphere to some extent. During the first three weeks after the accident, the level of radiation in the atmosphere in several places around the globe was above normal; but these levels quickly receded. No studies have been able to point to a direct link between Chernobyl and increased cancer risks or other health problems outside the immediately affected republics of Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation.







    9. What happened to the environment and animals after the accident?  
Mutations did occur in plants and animals after the plant explosion. Leaves changed shape and some animals were born with physical deformities. Despite the increased radiation levels, rare species are now returning in large numbers to the area. These animals include beavers, moose, wolves and wild boar, plus species of birds.







    10. Is it safe to visit the area now?  
One may certainly visit the Chernobyl area, including even the exclusion zone, which is a 30 kilometre radius surrounding the plant, all of whose reactors are now closed. Although some of the radioactive isotopes released into the atmosphere still linger (such as Strontium-90 and Caesium-137), they are at tolerable exposure levels for limited periods of time. Some residents of the exclusion zone have returned to their homes at their own free will, and they live in areas with higher than normal environmental radiation levels. However, these levels are not fatal. Exposure to low but unusual levels of radiation over a period of time is less dangerous than exposure to a huge amount at once, and studies have been unable to link any direct increase in cancer risks to chronic low-level exposure.







    11. What was done to ensure the safety of other RBMK reactors, so that this scenario will not present itself again?  
Lessons learned from the accident were a significant driving force behind a decade of IAEA assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Much of this work focused on identifying the weaknesses in and improving the design safety of VVR and RBMK reactors. Upgrading was performed on all RBMK units to eliminate the design deficiencies which contributed to the Chernobyl accident, to improve shutdown mechanisms and heighten general safety awareness among staff. Just as important as the design safety work has been the focus on operational safety and on systems of regulatory oversight.







    12. How do the inhabitants live now?  
There are 187 small communities in the exclusion zone that remain virtually abandoned to this day. A few inhabitants chose to return to their homes in the exclusion zone, but children are not allowed to live in this area. The evacuated population lives mainly in newly constructed towns such as Slavutich in areas with very little or no contamination.







    13. What will happen to the plant now that it is closed?  
On December 15, 2000, the last reactor in operation at the Chernobyl site was shut down and the phase of decommissioning began. This involves the removal and disposal of fuel and wastes, decontamination of the plant and the area surrounding it, including any soil and water that may be radioactive. There are three retired reactors to be decommissioned on site, a project expected to take several decades. The project will be conducted under the supervision of the Ukrainian government. The IAEA will assist by providing planning, engineering and administrative advice. The fate of the fourth reactor where the tragic accident occurred in 1986 is as yet undetermined.







    14. What is the state of the protective shelter built around the fourth reactor?  
Under extremely hazardous conditions, thousands of ""Liquidators"" worked to contain the remains of the fourth reactor. The shelter surrounding the reactor was completed less than six months after the explosion during peak radioactivity levels. The massive concrete and steel ""Sarcophagus"", quickly constructed using ""arms length"" methods, has deteriorated over the years, creating a potentially hazardous situation. Several repairs were made to the current shelter, including the stabilisation of the ventilation stack and reinforcement of the roof. In addition, a plan for the construction of a more secure and permanent structure to be built around the existing Sarcophagus was drafted; work has already begun on the infrastructure of this new shelter. The plan, called the Shelter Implementation Plan, is a project of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. Both efforts, whose combined expected expenditures over the next eight or nine years exceed $765 million, are administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

What Is An Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR)?



An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is a device used in generators with the purpose of automatically regulating voltage, which means that it will turn fluctuating voltage levels into constant voltage levels. AVRs work by stabilizing the output voltage of generators at variable loads, but can also divide the reactive load between generators that are running in parallel (voltage droop), and helps the generator respond to overloads.
To put it as simply as possible, AVRs continuously take input variable voltage ranges and maintain a constant output at a fixed voltage. Having an automatic voltage regulator for your generators is essential to protect the generator from power fluctuations and ensure better performance. 
Browse Used Generators
Voltage Regulators: WHat Do They Do?
Voltage regulators deliver a constant output voltage level to your equipment, regardless of incoming voltage. Your AVR constantly monitors incoming voltage, detecting changes in the voltage level. Each AVR generates a stable reference voltage, which it uses to ensure it delivers the correct output voltage. As the AVR compares voltages, it adjusts the output from the incoming voltage to match that reference voltage. Then, it gives your devices an adjusted output voltage. A generator voltage regulator is critical for keeping your generator working when needed. 
What Are the Functions of an Automated Voltage Regulator (AVR)?
The most important function of AVRs is to automatically control generator voltage and keep the output constant at the appropriate voltage level range for your generator regardless of the current being drawn by the load. Along with voltage stabilization and regulation, they also provide:

Surge protection: AVRs adjust voltages to safe levels and provide surge protection against electrical surges, spikes and generator overload. 
Load division: They can also divide the reactive load between generators that are running in parallel.
Automatic bypass: Some AVRs can switch into bypass mode when faults are detected. The AVR allows power to flow directly to the device, preventing AVR issues from causing problems. 
Fault detection: Advanced AVRs might detect faults like over-voltage, under-voltage and over-temperature conditions. They’ll alert users to these issues, ensuring you can get fixes faster. 

Why Are Automatic Voltage Regulators Important for Generators?
Unregulated generators have no AVR. This often makes them generally unable to meet the power needs and requirements for every piece of equipment connected to the generator. This is because some unregulated generators cannot control or regulate voltage, so the terminal voltage will always continue to decrease as the load requirements continue to increase.
If generator voltage is not consistent, it can affect the generator and anything powered by it. Too much or too little voltage can cause your equipment to experience performance issues or lead to damage. Overheating might cause equipment damage, while insufficient power can lead to malfunctions. Your equipment relies on consistent voltage to get the job done correctly and with minimal wear. This is where AVRs come in — they keep the voltage consistent. This helps mitigate and even eliminate fluctuation damage to appliances, machinery, devices and equipment.
The AVR directly influences your generator‘s performance and life span. It’s an essential generator part — its performance affects the items to which the generator provides power. Additionally, it ensures that the voltage output delivered will be consistent in its load current, even if fluctuations happen in the background.
Benefits of an AVR
An AVR keeps your generator and electrical devices safe by maintaining a steady voltage level. While power supply voltages might fluctuate, the AVR delivers consistent voltage to your device. Some benefits of an AVR for your equipment include:


Longer life span: Delivering stable voltage can extend your equipment’s life span. Dealing with fluctuating voltage, especially too much, can affect your equipment. Giving your equipment the proper voltage consistently can reduce wear, minimizing repairs and costs.
Better protection: An AVR’s consistent voltage delivery protects your devices from voltage spikes and drops. Spikes create excess heat, potentially overloading and damaging your devices. With an AVR, you reduce the risk of spike and drop-related damage.
Enhanced performance: Consistent voltage also means better performance. Instead of dealing with fluctuating voltage levels, your devices consistently get the necessary voltage. They can operate more efficiently and effectively. Additionally, you protect critical applications where minor disruptions can create significant issues. 

AVR Maintenance
Regular AVR maintenance is critical for proper function. Like all electric devices, your AVR needs regular maintenance to prevent breakdowns. Over time, dust and dirt can accumulate, components can wear out, and calibration needs fine-tuning. Professional AVR maintenance protects your devices and ensures your AVR is performing effectively. AVR maintenance can include:

Visual checks: Technicians inspect all components for wear, fraying, corrosion, loose connections and overheated components. Spotting these early lets you correct minor problems before they become major issues.
Airbrushing: Technicians will airbrush your AVR components to remove dirt and dust buildup if needed. Clearing buildup keeps everything clean and prevents connection issues. 
Voltage testing: Voltage testing ensures your AVR can handle different voltages while delivering consistent voltage to your equipment. This testing ensures your AVR can handle sudden fluctuations. 
Calibration: Calibration aligns your AVR’s output with your desired voltage levels. Regular calibration is critical for safe, effective performance. 

Even with the best maintenance, your AVR can experience issues. If you’re dealing with these problems, it might be time for repair or replacement:

Unusual sounds
Frequent generator shutoffs or restarts
Deviations in the power output stability
Generator failing to meet loads
Frequent error codes or alerts in the diagnostic system

What is the Blue Shell in Mario Kart?,"The Blue Shell is a power-up item in the Mario Kart series. It first appeared in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, released in 2003.

When a player obtains a Blue Shell, they will receive a boost of speed and acceleration, making them difficult to catch up to. The Blue Shell is a unique item in that it does not have a specific name, but is instead referred to as the ""Blue Shell"" or ""Blue Shells"" in the game.

The Blue Shell is most commonly used as a strategy to knock an opponent out of the race. However, it can also be used opportunistically to gain an advantage in a close race.

Here are some specific details and examples of the Blue Shell in Mario Kart:

* In Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the Blue Shell is a unique item that cannot be obtained in any other way.
* In Mario Kart Wii, the Blue Shell is a more powerful item that can be obtained from a Blue Shell Item Box.
* In Mario Kart 8, the Blue Shell is a more powerful item that can be obtained from a Blue Shell Item Box or a Blue Shell Item Block.
* In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the Blue Shell is a more powerful item that can be obtained from a Blue Shell Item Box or a Blue Shell Item Block.
* In Mario Kart Tour, the Blue Shell is a unique item that can be obtained from a Blue Shell Item Box or a Blue Shell Item Block.
* In Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, the Blue Shell is a unique item that can be obtained from a Blue Shell Item Box or a Blue Shell Item Block.

It's worth noting that the Blue Shell does not have a specific name in all of the Mario Kart games. However, it is consistently referred to as the ""Blue Shell"" or ""Blue Shells"" in the game.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_shell,"

Power-up in the Mario Kart series
Blue shellMario Kart  elementA spiny shell (commonly called a blue shell) as it appears in Mario Kart 8PublisherNintendoFirst appearanceMario Kart 64 (1996)GenreKart racing game
The blue shell,[1][2] officially referred to by Nintendo as the Spiny Shell,[3][4][5] is a power-up item in the Mario Kart video game series. Originating in Mario Kart 64 (1996) and featured in every main entry of the series since then, the Spiny Shell, when used, aims directly at the racer in first place, stopping them on impact. The Spiny Shell acts as a ""catch-up"" mechanic, with racers ranked towards the bottom having a better chance of it spawning when driving into item boxes, giving them a better chance at diminishing the lead of the racer in top position.[6][7][8] In addition to the Mario Kart series, the blue shell appeared in the Super Smash Bros. series from 2001's Melee onwards (it has been directly featured as a power-up item from Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U onwards), and in Mario Hoops 3-on-3.[9][10] A character based on the item appears in the 2023 film The Super Mario Bros. Movie, voiced by Scott Menville.[11]
Initially, the blue shell was impossible to stop or dodge once fired, until Mario Kart: Super Circuit (2001) and subsequent games allowed ways for the targeted racer to do so, albeit only with combinations of precise timing and specific items. As it is likely to spawn at least once during a race, the power-up item has earned a reputation of frequently destroying a player's lead, or suddenly ruining their chances of winning.[12] Because of this, the blue shell has largely come to be seen as one of the best and most famous, yet also one of the most frustrating items in video game history.


History[edit]
The Mario series features some visually similar figures which predate the blue shell, such as the red Spinies from the original Super Mario Bros. (1985) and blue Koopa Troopas from Super Mario World (1990).[1]
In Mario Kart 64, racers in 4th-8th place can obtain the blue shell. Since the release of Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the series sees the blue shell being more common to characters closer to the lead (if the leader pulls away from the rest of the pack), and in all releases prior to Mario Kart 7, it is unable to hit characters on its way to the lead, as it flies above the track using wings rather than gliding upon its surface.[1][13]
There are few techniques possible in some Mario Kart games to evade a blue shell, such as using a timed boost from a Mushroom item in Mario Kart DS onwards. In Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it is possible to use the new Super Horn item to destroy blue shells.[8][14][15] A toy model of the blue shell is included in the limited edition package of Mario Kart 8.[16][17] A blue-shelled Koopa General (voiced by Scott Menville)[18] appears in the 2023 film The Super Mario Bros. Movie, obliterating much of the film's depiction of Rainbow Road after shouting ""Blue shell!"" as a battlecry.[19]

Development[edit]
In a 2011 interview with Kotaku, Hideki Konno, who directed Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64, was asked about the blue shell's inclusion in the series. He stated that it was introduced in Mario Kart 64 to keep players together due to the limited processing power of the Nintendo 64 and that ""we wanted to create a race where everyone was in it until the end"".[7] In a 2017 interview with Eurogamer, Kosuke Yabuki, the director of Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart 8, said that Nintendo has experimented with removing the blue shell from the games, but ""it feels like something's missing. Like there's something not quite enough in the game. So for now we've kept it in.""[20]

Reception[edit]
Alex Langley's The Geek Handbook names as one of Mario Kart 8's greatest frustrations, to be hit by a blue shell shortly before reaching the finish line.[8][21]  David Murphy from PCMag and Jamie Andrew from Den of Geek both called the Blue Shell the “Blue Shell of Death”.[22][23] In 2017, Keith Stuart of The Guardian included the blue shell as one of the ""11 greatest video game objects"" in history, calling it ""the most controversial item in the Mario universe.""[24]
Calling it ""The Great Equalizer"" for its enhancement of the elements of struggle and luck, Kotaku's Nathan Grayson considered the blue shell to be the most despised, and best, item of the Mario Kart series.[25] Kotaku's Yannick Le Jacq considered the blue shell to be the most notable and game-changing among Mario Kart's ""most notorious"" items, adding that this made it ""a lot more fun"" to use in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U too.[9]
Nintendo Power called the use of a Mushroom to dodge a blue shell a ""defining moment"" of gameplay in Mario Kart Wii.[26] Maxwell McGee of GameSpot considered the ability to destroy the ""dreaded"" blue shells with a new item, the Super Horn, to be a particularly exciting feature of Mario Kart 8.[14] Steve Watts of GameSpot said in 2022 that ""the Blue Shell has become synonymous with Mario Kart"" and is now an icon within video game history.[27]

What is the role of the Gamma Knife in medical treatment?,"The Gamma Knife is a stereotactic radiosurgery system used to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including brain tumors and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Here are some specific details and examples of the Gamma Knife's role in medical treatment:

1. Name of person: Dr. David B. Fein, a neurosurgeon who pioneered the use of the Gamma Knife in the United States.
2. Numbers: The Gamma Knife is known by several different names, including the CyberKnife, Gamma Knife Perfexion, and Intraoperative Gamma Knife (IGK).
3. Events: The first clinical trial using the Gamma Knife was conducted in 1978, and since then, it has become a widely accepted treatment option for a variety of neurological conditions.
4. Locations: The Gamma Knife is used in hospitals and medical centers around the world, including the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
5. Dates: The first Gamma Knife surgery was performed in 1981, and since then, it has become a widely accepted treatment option for a variety of neurological conditions.
6. Times: The Gamma Knife procedure typically takes several hours to complete, and patients may need to stay in the hospital for several days after the procedure.
7. Specifics: The Gamma Knife procedure uses a computer-guided beam of radiation to target and destroy specific areas of the brain or other organs. It is typically used to treat conditions that cannot be treated with medication or surgery, such as brain tumors, AVMs, and certain types of epilepsy.

Overall, the Gamma Knife is a highly precise and effective treatment option for a variety of neurological conditions, and it has played a significant role in the development of modern neurosurgery.",False,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/gamma-knife-radiosurgery,"

Gamma Knife Radiosurgery


What is Gamma Knife radiosurgery?
Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a type of radiotherapy treatment. It’s also called stereotactic radiosurgery. Even though it’s called surgery, a Gamma Knife procedure doesn't use incisions. It also isn’t a knife. Gamma Knife uses very precise beams of gamma rays to treat an area of disease (lesion) or growth (tumor). It’s most often used in the brain. The beams of gamma radiation send a very intense dose of radiation to a small area without a need to make an incision. Radiosurgery destroys cells so that they can’t grow. A lesion or tumor will shrink in size over time.
Gamma Knife radiosurgery is called surgery because the end result is similar to removing a lesion with surgery. The beams of radiation are precisely focused to reach the lesion, with little effect on nearby healthy tissue. The Gamma Knife system is just one type of radiosurgery system. Gamma Knife is a brand name.
A Gamma Knife procedure is done by a treatment team. The team is led by a radiation oncologist. This is a specialist in radiation treatment for cancer. The other team members may include:


Neurosurgeon


Neuroradiologist


Radiation therapist


Registered nurse


Medical physicist


Dosimetrist


Other healthcare providers as needed


Gamma Knife treatment in most cases involves these steps:


Head frame placement.  To keep the head from moving during treatment, a box-shaped frame is attached to the head. Pins designed for this purpose fasten the head frame to the skull. The head frame is also a guide to focus the gamma ray beams to the exact location of the lesion.


Tumor or lesion location imaging.  Once the head frame is in place, the exact location of the lesion will be found using a CT scan or MRI. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays and a computer to create a detailed image. MRI uses large magnets and a computer to make images without the use of X-rays. You may need a cerebral angiogram if a blood vessel lesion, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), is being treated. A cerebral angiogram uses X-rays and a special dye. The dye is injected into a large blood vessel to find problems in the blood vessels.


Radiation dose planning.  After the CT scan or MRI, the radiation therapy team will determine the treatment plan. The results of the imaging scan and other information will be used by a medical physicist to determine the best treatment.


Radiation treatment.  After the person is positioned for the treatment, a type of helmet with hundreds of holes is placed over the head frame. These holes help to focus the radiation beams on the target. Treatment will last anywhere from a few minutes up to a few hours. The length of time depends on the type and location of the area being treated. In most cases, only one treatment session is needed for a lesion.


Why might I need Gamma Knife radiosurgery?
Gamma Knife radiosurgery is most often used to treat:


Small and medium tumors and lesions in the brain


Trigeminal neuralgia, when pressure on the trigeminal nerve causes spasms of extreme facial pain


Acoustic neuroma, a noncancerous tumor in the brain that affects nerves that control hearing


Arteriovenous malformations (AVM), a tangle of expanded blood vessels that disrupts normal blood flow in the brain


Your healthcare provider may have other reasons to advise Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Gamma Knife radiosurgery may be used when a brain lesion can’t be reached by standard surgery. Or it may be used when a person can’t have standard surgery, such as craniotomy. The effects of a Gamma Knife treatment occur slowly over time. Because of this, it’s not for people who need immediate effects. Talk with your provider about the reason for your procedure.
What are the risks of Gamma Knife radiosurgery?
All procedures have some risks. The risks of this procedure may include:


Swelling of the brain


Headache


Nausea and vomiting


Numbness


Hair loss near treated area (temporary)


Seizures


Soreness and swelling in the area being treated


Diarrhea


Weakness


Loss of balance


Vision problems


Radiation exposure


Pain at the head frame pin insertion sites


If you're pregnant or suspect that you could be, tell your healthcare provider. Radiation exposure in pregnancy may lead to birth defects.
Your risks may vary depending on your general health and other factors. Ask your provider which risks apply most to you. Talk with them about any concerns you have.
How do I get ready for Gamma Knife radiosurgery?
Your healthcare provider will explain the procedure to you. Ask them any questions you have. You will be asked to sign a consent form that gives permission to do the procedure. Read the form carefully. Ask questions if anything isn't clear.
Tell your provider if you:


Are pregnant or think you may be pregnant


Are allergic to contrast dye or iodine


Are sensitive to or allergic to any medicines, latex, tape, or anesthetic medicines (local and general)


Take any prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements


Have had a bleeding disorder


Take blood-thinning medicine (anticoagulant), aspirin, or other medicines that affect blood clotting


Have any type of implant, such as a pacemaker, implantable defibrillator, artificial heart valve, surgical clips for a brain aneurysm, implanted medicines pump, chemotherapy port, nerve stimulators, eye or ear implants, stents, coils, or filters


Make sure to:


Stop taking certain medicines before the procedure, if instructed by your healthcare provider


Not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure or as instructed by your provider


Wash your hair with special shampoo either the night before or morning of the procedure, as instructed


Plan to have someone drive you home after the procedure


Follow any other instructions your provider gives you


You may have blood tests, urine tests, and other tests or exams before the procedure. Your provider will tell you more.
What happens during Gamma Knife radiosurgery?
You may have your procedure as an outpatient. This means you go home the same day. Or it may be done as part of a longer stay in the hospital. The way the procedure is done may vary. It depends on your condition and your healthcare provider's methods. In most cases, the procedure will follow this process:


You may be asked to remove your clothes. If so, you'll be given a hospital gown to wear. You may be asked to remove jewelry or other objects.


An IV (intravenous) line may be put into your arm or hand.


Hair in the area around the head frame insertion sites may be trimmed. The skin on your head will be cleaned where the pins for the head frame will be placed.


A numbing medicine (local anesthetic) will be injected at the head frame pin insertion sites. The head frame will be attached to your head with pins that are inserted into your skull. You may feel some pressure during the placement of the head frame. This feeling should go away in a few minutes.


After the head frame is attached, you'll undergo brain imaging. This is done so that the location of the brain tumor or lesion can be precisely found for the treatment. The brain imaging may be done with a CT scan or MRI. After the brain imaging, the team will use the images to create your treatment plan. In some cases, the imaging may be done before the day of your radiosurgery.


You'll be taken into the room where the Gamma Knife equipment is located. You'll lie down on a sliding table. A special helmet called a collimator helmet may be fitted over the head frame. The collimator helmet has 201 holes in it. These holes allow radiation beams to pass through it into your brain in a precise pattern that is determined by a computer.


Once the helmet is in place, the table will slide into the Gamma Knife unit. You may hear a clicking sound as the helmet moves into place in the machine.


The treatment team will go into another room. You can talk with the team through an intercom. They can hear you at all times. You'll be watched on a video monitor.


You will not feel or hear anything from the Gamma Knife unit during the treatment session.


The treatment session may last 2 to 4 hours. The length of the session will depend on the treatment plan created for you.


After the session is over, the table will slide out of the Gamma Knife machine. You'll be able to get up, unless you had an angiogram before the Gamma Knife procedure.


The head frame will be removed. The pin insertion sites will be cleaned. Sterile dressings will be put on the sites.


What happens after Gamma Knife radiosurgery?
After the procedure, you'll be watched for a period of time.
Once you're able to drink, the IV line will be removed. You may eat and drink as you're able. You may feel some discomfort after the procedure, such as a headache or nausea. Tell your healthcare provider so you can be treated for these effects.
You'll most likely go home at the end of the day. You'll need to have someone drive you home. If needed, you may stay in the hospital overnight. Once you’re home, you may go back to your normal diet, medicines, and activities, unless your provider tells you something different. You may be told to stay away from strenuous activity for a period of time.
You'll most likely be allowed to gently shampoo your hair the day after the procedure. But, don't scrub the pin sites on your head until they've completed healed. Healing usually takes about a week.
Call your healthcare provider if you have any of the following:


Severe headache that’s not relieved by pain medicine


Any weakness, numbness, or vision problems that are new or worse


Bleeding or other fluid leaking from the pin sites that doesn’t stop


Seizures


Your provider may give you other instructions after the procedure.
Next steps
Before you agree to the test or procedure make sure you know:


The name of the test or procedure

What is the Oort Cloud?,"The Oort Cloud is a hypothetical region of icy bodies surrounding the Solar System, located at a distance of around 2,500 to 10,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. This region is named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who first proposed its existence in 1950.

According to Oort's hypothesis, the Oort Cloud is a spherical distribution of icy objects, including comets and other small bodies, that extends beyond the Kuiper Belt and reflects the outward migration of the planets. The Oort Cloud is thought to contain between 10 and 100 million comets, with the most distant objects having orbits that take them beyond the orbit of Neptune.

The Oort Cloud is much larger than the Kuiper Belt and is thought to contain a wide range of objects, including small icy bodies, dust, and gas. The most distant objects in the Oort Cloud are thought to be in a region known as the ""Oort Cloud boundary,"" which is located at a distance of around 50,000 to 100,000 AU from the Sun.

There are several examples of comets that are thought to be associated with the Oort Cloud. For example, the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which was observed during the mission of the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft, was found to be on an extremely elongated orbit that takes it beyond the orbit of Neptune and into the Oort Cloud.

In addition to comets, the Oort Cloud is thought to contain other small bodies, such as asteroids, that could potentially be captured by the gravity of a planet or star and become a part of the Oort Cloud.

The Oort Cloud has been the subject of much research and speculation in the field of astronomy, and it remains an area of active investigation and discovery.",False,https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/,"

Oort Cloud Facts

The Oort Cloud lies far beyond Pluto and the most distant edges of the Kuiper Belt. 
While the planets of our solar system orbit in a flat plane, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell surrounding the Sun, planets and Kuiper Belt Objects. It's like a big, thick bubble around our solar system, made of icy, comet-like objects.

What was Göbekli Tepe?,"Göbekli Tepe is a prehistoric site located in modern-day Turkey. It is one of the oldest known structures in human history, dating back to around 10,000 years ago. It is a massive temple complex that covers an area of about 20 hectares and consists of over 200 pillars, each weighing up to 10 tons.

The site is named after the village of Göbekli Tepe, where it was first discovered in the 1960s. The first excavations at the site were led by German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt and Turkish archaeologist Prof. Dr. İnan Çukuroğlu. They uncovered the first pillars in 1963, and since then, the site has been extensively studied and researched.

The pillars at Göbekli Tepe are believed to have been used for religious ceremonies and to serve as a place of worship. The pillars are carved with intricate designs and symbols that are still not fully understood. Some scholars believe that the site was used for communal worship, while others believe that it was used for individual worship.

The site is also notable for the techniques used to create the pillars. The pillars were carved from a single block of rock using simple tools such as adzes and axes. The pillars were then transported to the site and erected using a system of ropes and pulleys.

The discovery of Göbekli Tepe has shed new light on the development of human civilization. It is believed that the site was used for religious ceremonies and was likely used by early hunter-gatherer communities. The site is also important for understanding the development of agriculture and the formation of early states.

Overall, Göbekli Tepe is an important archaeological site that has helped to shed light on the development of human civilization and the early stages of human history.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe,"

Göbekli Tepe (Turkish: [ɟœbecˈli teˈpe],[2] 'Potbelly Hill';[3] Kurdish: Girê Mirazan or Xerabreşkê, 'Wish Hill'[4]) is a Neolithic archaeological site in Turkey, on the southern border of Southeastern Anatolia. The settlement was inhabited from around 9500 BCE to at least 8000 BCE,[5] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars – among the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15 m (50 ft) high, 8 ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures[6] and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.
The site was first used at the dawn of the southwest Asian Neolithic period, which marked the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world. Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture, but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa. Göbekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on the top of a rocky mountaintop, with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation, has played a prominent role in this debate.
Recent findings suggest that there was a settlement at Göbekli Tepe, with domestic structures, extensive processing of cereals, a water supply, and tools associated with daily life.[7] This contrasts to a previous interpretation of the site as a sanctuary used by nomads, with few or no permanent inhabitants.[1] No definitive purpose has been determined for the megalithic structures, which have been popularly described as the ""world's first temple[s]"".[8] They were likely roofed, and appear to have regularly collapsed, been inundated by slope slides, and subsequently repaired or rebuilt.[9] The architecture and iconography is similar to other contemporary sites in the vicinity, such as Karahan Tepe.[10]
The site was first noted in a survey in 1963. German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt recognized its significance in 1994 and began excavations there the following year. After his death in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, Şanlıurfa Museum, and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul. Göbekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as ""one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture"".[11] As of 2015[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[12] Additional areas were examined by geophysical surveys, which showed the mound to contain at least 20 large enclosures.[13]


Geography and environment
Present day landscape around Göbekli TepeGöbekli Tepe is located in the Taş Tepeler ('Stone Hills'), in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains.[14] It overlooks the Harran plain and the headwaters of the Balikh River, a tributary of the Euphrates.[14] The site is a tell (artificial mound) on a flat limestone plateau.[15] In the north, the plateau is connected to the neighbouring mountains by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.[16]
The climate of the area was warmer and wetter when Göbekli Tepe was occupied than it is today.[15] The site was surrounded by an open steppe grassland,[15] with abundant wild cereals, including einkorn, wheat, and barley,[17] and herds of grazing animals such as wild sheep, wild goat, gazelle, and equids.[18] Large herds of goitered gazelle may have passed by the site in seasonal migrations.[19] There is no evidence of substantial woodlands nearby;[15] 90% of the charcoal recovered at the site was from pistachio or almond trees.[20]
Like most Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) sites in the Urfa region, Göbekli Tepe was built on a high point on the edge of the mountains, giving it both a wide view over the plain beneath, and good visibility from the plain.[21] This location also gave the builders good access to raw material: the soft limestone bedrock from which the complex was built, and the flint to make the tools to work the limestone.[21] The prehistoric village acquired drinking water through a rainwater harvesting system, consisting of carved channels[22] that fed several cisterns carved into the bedrock under the site,[23] which could hold at least 150 cubic metres (5,300 cu ft) of water.[24][25] Additionally, the local water table may have been higher, activating springs closer to the site which are dormant today.[26]
Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south, and west of a mulberry that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,[27] but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools. At the western escarpment, a small cave has been discovered in which a small relief depicting a bovid was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.[28]

Dawn of village life
Göbekli Tepe was built and occupied during the earliest part of the Southwest Asian Neolithic, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN, c. 9600–7000 BCE).[29] Beginning at the end of the last Ice Age, the PPN marks ""the beginnings of village life"",[30] producing the earliest evidence for permanent human settlements in the world.[30][31] Archaeologists have long associated the appearance of these settlements with the Neolithic Revolution—the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture—but disagree on whether the adoption of farming caused people to settle down, or settling down caused people to adopt farming.[32] Despite the name, the Neolithic Revolution in Southwest Asia was ""drawn out and locally variable"".[33] Elements of village life appeared as early as 10,000 years before the Neolithic in places,[34][35] and the transition to agriculture took thousands of years, with different paces and trajectories in different regions.[36][37] Archaeologists divide the Pre-Pottery Neolithic into two subperiods: the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA, c. 9600–8800 BCE) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, c. 8800 and 7000 BCE).[31] The earliest phases at Göbekli Tepe have been dated to the PPNA; later phases to the PPNB.[38]
Evidence indicates the inhabitants of Göbekli Tepe were hunter-gatherers who supplemented their diet with early forms of domesticated cereal and lived in villages for at least part of the year. Tools such as grinding stones and mortars and pestles found at the site have been analyzed and suggest considerable cereal processing. Archaeozoological evidence hints at ""large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn.""[24]
PPN villages consisted mainly of clusters of stone or mud brick houses,[30] but sometimes also substantial monuments and large buildings.[31] These include the tower and walls at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), as well as large, roughly contemporaneous circular buildings at Göbekli Tepe, Nevalı Çori, Çayönü, Wadi Feynan 16, Jerf el-Ahmar, Tell 'Abr 3, and Tepe Asiab.[39] Archaeologists typically associate these structures with communal activities which, together with the communal effort needed to build them, helped to maintain social interactions in PPN communities as they grew in size.[40]
The T-shaped pillar tradition seen at Göbekli Tepe is unique to the Urfa region, but is found at the majority of PPN sites there.[41] These include Nevalı Çori, Hamzan Tepe,[42] Karahan Tepe,[43] Harbetsuvan Tepesi,[44] Sefer Tepe,[41] and Taslı Tepe.[45] Other stone stelae—without the characteristic T shape—have been documented at contemporary sites further afield, including Çayönü, Qermez Dere, and Gusir Höyük.[46]

Chronology
Radiocarbon dating shows that the earliest exposed structures at Göbekli Tepe were built between 9500 and 9000 BCE, towards the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period.[9][38] The site was significantly expanded in the early 9th millennium BCE and remained in use until around 8000 BCE, or perhaps slightly later (the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, PPNB).[38] There is evidence that smaller groups returned to live amongst the ruins after the Neolithic structures were abandoned.[38]
Schmidt originally dated the site to the PPN based on the types of stone tools found there, considering a PPNA date ""most probable"".[47] Establishing its absolute chronology took longer due to methodological challenges.[48][49] Though the first two radiocarbon dates were published in 1998,[50] these and other samples from the fill of the structure dated to the late 10th and early 9th millennium – 500 to 1000 years later than expected for a PPNA site.[48] Schmidt's team explained the discrepancy in light of their theory that this material was brought to the site from elsewhere when it was abandoned, and so was not representative of the actual use of the structures.[48][49] They instead turned to a novel method of dating organic material preserved in the plaster on the structure's walls, which resulted in dates more consistent with a PPNA occupation, in the middle or even early 10th millennium BCE.[51][52][9] Subsequent research led to a significant revision of Schmidt's chronology, including the abandonment of the hypothesis that the fill of the structures was brought from elsewhere, and a recognition that direct dates on plaster are affected by the old wood effect.[53] Together with new radiocarbon dates, this has established the site's absolute chronology as falling in the period 9500 to 8000 BCE – the late PPNA and PPNB.[1][54]

Building phases
The preliminary, now abandoned,[55] stratigraphic model by Klaus Schmidt consisted of three architectural layers. The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the 10th millennium BCE (PPNA). The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the 9th millennium BCE (early to middle PPNB). Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.[9]
The revised chronology consists of eight phases that span at least 1,500 years. It details the history of the large circular enclosures, including events that led to their alteration or abandonment, and the evolution of the domestic buildings surrounding them.[56]

Phase 1: The earliest settlement phase dates to the second half of the 10th millennium BCE and includes the first versions of enclosures A to D and round-oval domestic structures, which indicate a (semi) sedentary lifestyle.[55]
Phase 2: In the second phase (early 9th millennium BCE) significant modifications of enclosures A-D were undertaken: New walls were erected, which incorporated the first monolithic T-shaped pillars. An increasing number of domestic structures were built, still mostly oval-round, though with a rising tendency for a rectangular floor plan.[55]
Phases 3–5: In the early PPNB, the northern and western slopes saw the erection of rectangular (domestic) structures. They underwent multiple construction phases, for instance, the addition of benches with incorporated T-shaped pillar, and new inner walls resulting in more rectangular rooms. The large enclosures were modified as well. Walls were repaired and new ones added. Benches were placed against the interior sides of phase 2 walls.[56] At the end of the early PPNB, a slope slide inundated the lower lying structures, flushing sediments and domestic rubble (likely including midden and burials) downhill. This caused extensive damage to enclosure D, and led to stabilization works in Phase 5. Building C was reconstructed for the last time, and a terrace wall was placed above it, to prevent future slope-slides. Nonetheless, a second major slope-slide event occurred, which likely resulted in enclosure D being abandoned in the late 9th millennium BCE.[56]
Phases 6 and 7: Building activity gradually declined in phases 6 and 7 (late 9th to early 8th millennium BCE). The loss of enclosures B and D may have led to the construction of building G and the ""Lion Pillar Building"". In Phase 7 another terrace wall was constructed in a last attempt to stabilize the northern slope.[57]
Phase 8: In the final occupation period, small habitation structures were built within the remains of the abandoned Neolithic village.[57]

Large enclosures
The first circular compounds appear around the latter half of the 10th millennium BCE. They range from 10 to 30 m (33 to 98 ft) in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 m (330 ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.[58] The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.[59]
Two taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.[60] Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from Neolithic cave paintings elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelle, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; arthropods such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of Çatalhöyük and Jericho.
Few humanoid figures have appeared in the art at Göbekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.[61] Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.[citation needed]
Some of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of terrazzo (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.[62] Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles c. 9000 BCE.
Later enclosures were rectangular in shape, perhaps to make more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,[63] but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings continued to serve the same function in the culture,[64] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.[65] Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name ""lion pillar building"" by which their enclosure is known.[66]

Slope slide events
The enclosures, lying over 10 metres (33 ft) below the highest areas of the settlement, were subject to several slope slide events during the occupation period of Göbekli Tepe.[67] A particularly severe one occurred at the end of the early PPNB. which inundated enclosure D with rubble of domestic structures and sediments, including burials and midden deposits. This caused severe damage to the enclosure, which led to repairs and stabilization works to be conducted. At a later point, in Building Phase 5, terrace walls were erected, likely to prevent future damage from such events. These measures, however, proved futile, when a second major slope slide probably caused the enclosure to the abandoned during Building Phase 6, around the late 9th millennium BCE. Other enclosure suffered a similar fate, which might have led to new enclosures being constructed to replace them.[56]
Previously, it had been assumed that the large enclosures were intentionally back-filled, an interpretation that has fallen out of favor since Klaus Schmidt's death.[68]

Domestic structures
In the earliest occupation phase, round-oval domestic structures were built alongside the large enclosures, which indicate a (semi) sedentary lifestyle. Over time there was an increasing tendency of these buildings to have a rectangular floor plan. In the final settlement phase only small structures were erected.[56]

Burials
Before any burials were found, Schmidt speculated that graves could have been located in niches behind the walls of the circular building.[69] In 2017, fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered at the site, interpreted as a manifestation of the widespread Neolithic skull cult.[29] Special preparation of human crania in the form of plastered human skulls is known from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period at Levantine sites such as Tell es-Sultan (also known as Jericho), Tell Aswad, and Yiftahel, and later in Anatolia at Çatalhöyük.[70][71][72]

Other structures
At the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.[73] It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.[28]
Apart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called ""complex E"". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Nevalı Çori it has also been called ""Temple of the Rock"". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at Göbekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.[74]

Later structures
The uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.
Around the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE, Göbekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the ""Stone-age zoo"" apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities.

Construction
The plateau Göbekli Tepe is situated on has been shaped by erosion and quarrying from the Neolithic onwards. There are four 10-metre-long (33 ft) and 20-centimetre-wide (7.9 in) channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These are possibly related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably, this is the remains of a Roman watchtower that was part of the Limes Arabicus, though this is conjecture.[75] Most structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.[75] Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3 metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of 7 m (23 ft) and its head has a width of 3 m (10 ft). Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.[citation needed]
Archaeologists disagree on how much labour was needed to construct the site. Schmidt maintained that ""the work of quarrying, transporting, and erecting tons of heavy, monolithic, and almost universally well-prepared limestone pillars [...] was not within the capability of a few people"".[76] Using Thor Heyerdahl's experiments with the moai of Rapa Nui as a reference, he estimated that moving the pillars alone must have involved hundreds of people.[26] According to these experiments, one moai of similar size to a T-shaped pillar from Göbekli Tepe would have taken 20 people a year to carve, and 50–75 people a week to transport 15 km.[77] Schmidt's team has also cited a 1917 account of the construction of a megalith on the Indonesian island of Nias, which took 525 people three days.[26][77] These estimates underpin their interpretation that the site was built by a large, non-resident workforce,[78] coerced or enticed there by a small religious elite.[79][80] However, others estimate that just 7–14 people could have moved the pillars using ropes and water or another lubricant, with techniques used to construct other monuments such as Stonehenge.[26] Experiments at Göbekli Tepe itself have suggested that all the PPNB structures currently exposed could have been built by 12–24 people in less than four months, allowing for time spent quarrying stone and gathering, and preparing food.[81] These labour estimates are thought to be within the capability of a single extended family or village community in the Neolithic.[26] They also match the number of people that could have comfortably been inside one of the buildings at the same time.[82]
Enclosures B, C and D were initially planned as a single, hierarchical complex that forms an equilateral triangle, according to Haklay and Gopher.[83]

Tools
Göbekli Tepe is littered with flint artifacts, from the ridge-top site to the slopes.[84] The tool assemblage found resembles that of other Northern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic (settlement) sites.[85]
In 1963, over 3,000 Neolithic tools were uncovered, the vast majority of excellent quality flint, only a handful of obsidian. Cores, various blades, flakes, scrapers, burins, and projectile points, were the most common tool types.[86]
Excavations of Space 16, a small building adjacent to enclosure D, yielded almost 700 tools. Most common were retouched artifacts, followed by scrapers, perforators and artifacts with gloss. Heavy duty tools, burins and microliths were also present.[87]
Over 7000 grinding stones have been found, spanning the entirety of the sites usage, which are suggested to have been used to process cereal based on phytoliths found in associated soil, though it is unclear whether the cereal was wild or cultivated.[24]

Iconography
Pillars
Reproduction of the central pillars of Enclosure D in the Şanlıurfa museum: engraved arms are visible on the shaft.
The stone pillars in the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe are T-shaped, similar to other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the region.[88] Unlike at these other sites, however, many of the pillars are carved – typically in low relief, though sometimes in high relief. Most carvings depict animals, mostly serpents, foxes, and boars, but also gazelle, mouflon (wild sheep), onager, ducks, and vultures. Insofar as they can be identified, the animals are male, and often depicted with an aggressive posture.[89][90]
Abstract shapes are also depicted, mostly an upright or horizontal H-shaped symbol, but also crescents and disks. Depictions of humans are rare; pillar 43 in enclosure D includes a headless man with an erect phallus. However, the 'T'-shape of the pillars themselves is anthropomorphic: the shaft is the body, and the top is the head. This is confirmed by the fact that some pillars include – in addition to animal reliefs – carvings of arms, hands, and loincloths.[91]
The two central pillars occupied a special place in the symbolic architecture of the enclosures. Those in Enclosure D represent humans, with arms, a belt, and a piece of cloth that hides the genitals. The sex of the individuals depicted cannot be clearly identified, though Schmidt suggested that they are two men because the belts they wear are a male attribute in the period. There is only one certain representation of a woman, depicted naked on a slab.[91]
Schmidt and zooarchaeologist Joris Peters have argued that the variety of fauna depicted on the pillars means they likely do not express a single iconography. They suggest that, since many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation, or served as totems.[92]




Pillar 10, Enclosure B: fox



Pillar 12, Enclosure C: ducks and boar



Pillar 27, Enclosure C: predator (perhaps a felid) hunting a boar



Pillar 37 (central), Enclosure C: fox



Pillar 43, Enclosure D: the ""Vulture Stone""


Other objects
The structures at Göbekli Tepe have also yielded a number of smaller carved stones, which typically cannot be attributed to one period or another. The iconography of these objects is similar to that of the pillars, mostly depicting animals, but also humans, again primarily male.[93][94]




Carved stone with animal (possibly a reptile, felid, or wolverine) in high relief



Boar statuette with legs



Sculptured stone pole



Boar statuette without legs



Head of an animal


A ""totem pole"" was discovered in one of the structures, dating to the early PPNB. Reassembled, it is 192 centimetres (6.30 ft) tall and 30 centimetres (0.98 ft) in diameter. It depicts three figures (from top to bottom): a predator (a bear or large felid) with a missing head, and the neck and arms of a human; another figure missing a head with human arms, likely male; and a third figure with a head that had survived intact. Snakes are carved on either side.[95]

Interpretation

Klaus Schmidt's view was that Göbekli Tepe was a stone-age mountain sanctuary.[citation needed] He suggested it was a central location for a cult of the dead and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead.[citation needed] Butchered bones found in large numbers from the local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.[96] Zooarchaeological analysis shows that gazelle were only seasonally present in the region, suggesting that events such as rituals and feasts were likely timed to occur during periods when game availability was at its peak.[19] Schmidt saw the construction of Göbekli Tepe as contributing to the later development of urban civilization.[97]Steles and sculptures from Göbekli Tepe in Şanlıurfa Museum 
Schmidt also speculated on the belief systems of the groups that created Göbekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He presumed shamanic practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in Mesopotamia, that was associated with extensive temples and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient Sumerian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain Ekur, which was inhabited by Annuna deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.[98] It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.[69][99][100] Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the Göbekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.[101]
The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, ""similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.""[26] It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.[102] According to Rémi Hadad, in recent years ""the interpretative enthusiasm that sought to see Göbekli Tepe as a regional ceremonial centre where nomadic populations would periodically converge is giving way to a vision that is more in line with what is known about other large Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, where ritual and profane functions coexist.""[103] For example, the discovery of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems has forced a revision of the 'temple' narrative.[1]

Research history
Klaus Schmidt delivering a lecture in Salzburg, 2014.
Before being documented by archaeologists, the hill Göbekli Tepe stands on, known locally in Kurdish as Girê Mirazan or Xerabreşkê (Girê Mirazan meaning 'Wish Hill'[4]), was considered a sacred place.[104][105]
The archaeological site was first noted in 1963 as part of an archaeological survey directed by Halet Çambel of Istanbul University and Robert John Braidwood of the University of Chicago.[106] American archaeologist Peter Benedict identified the stone tools collected from the surface of site as characteristic of the Aceramic Neolithic,[107] but mistook the upper parts of the T-shaped pillars for grave markers.[108] The hill had long been under agricultural cultivation, and generations of local inhabitants had frequently moved rocks and placed them in clearance piles, which may have disturbed the upper layers of the site. At some point, attempts had been made to break up some of the pillars, presumably by farmers who mistook them for ordinary large rocks.[69]
In October 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, who had previously been working at Nevalı Çori, was looking for evidence of similar sites in the area and decided to re-examine the location described by the Chicago researchers in 1963.[69][109] Asking in nearby villages about hills with flint,[109] he was guided to Göbekli Tepe by Mahmut Yıldız, whose family owned the land the site was situated on.[105] The Yıldız family had previously discovered finds while ploughing there, which they reported to the local museum.[105][110] Having found similar structures at Nevalı Çori, Schmidt recognized the possibility that the stone slabs were not grave markers as supposed by Benedict, but the tops of prehistoric megaliths. He began excavations the following year and soon unearthed the first of the huge T-shaped pillars.[69] Ultimately he found only three tombs on the eastmost hill-group, which were a pilgrimage destination.[111] Yıldız went on to work on the excavations and serve as the site's guard.[105]
Schmidt continued to direct excavations at the site on behalf of the Şanlıurfa Museum and the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) until his death in 2014. Since then, the DAI's research at the site has been coordinated by Lee Clare.[112][1] As of 2021[update], work on the site is conducted jointly by Istanbul University, the Şanlıurfa Museum, and the DAI, under the overall direction of Necmi Karul.[113][114] Recent excavations have been more limited than Schmidt's, focusing on detailed documentation and conservation of the areas already exposed.[114]

Conservation
Protective roof added to the site
Göbekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as ""one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture"".[11] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[12]
Conservation work at the site caused controversy in 2018, when Çiğdem Köksal Schmidt, an archaeologist, and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said that damage was caused by the use of concrete and ""heavy equipment"" during the construction of a new walkway. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred.[115]

What is the Ebola virus?,"The Ebola virus is a family of viruses that are transmitted to humans through the fecal-oral route, meaning that they enter the body through the mouth. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was first identified in 1976.

There are five different types of Ebola viruses: Ebola Sudan, Ebola Reston, Ebola Zaire, Reston Forest, and Bundibugyo. The virus is primarily found in Central and West Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

The Ebola virus has a fatality rate of up to 90%, making it one of the deadliest viruses known to humans. The virus causes symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting, which can progress to severe internal organ damage and death. The virus is often spread among animals, such as bats, fruit bats, and monkeys, which can then infect humans.

Some notable outbreaks of Ebola include:

* The 1976-1979 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was the first recorded outbreak of the virus and resulted in over 2800 deaths.
* The 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which was the largest recorded outbreak of Ebola, resulting in over 11,300 deaths.
* The ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is currently the largest recorded outbreak, with over 3,000 deaths as of September 2021.

It's important to note that while Ebola is a deadly virus, it is not contagious until symptoms appear. It is important to take preventative measures such as washing hands, wearing masks, and avoiding contact with sick animals or people to help prevent the spread of the virus.",False,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease,"

Ebola virus disease

20 April 2023

















Key facts

Vaccines to protect against some types of Ebola have been used to control the spread of Ebola in outbreaks. Other vaccines are in development.
Early supportive care with rehydration and the treatment of symptoms improves survival.
WHO has made strong recommendations for the use of two monoclonal antibody treatments in treating Ebola: mAb114 (Ansuvimab; Ebanga) and REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb).
The average Ebola case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25–90% in past outbreaks, depending on circumstances and the response.
Good outbreak control relies on taking many types of actions: care of patients, infection prevention and control, disease surveillance and contact tracing, good laboratory services, safe and dignified burials, and social mobilization.
Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks.



 OverviewEbola virus disease (EVD or Ebola) is a rare but severe illness in humans. It is often fatal.People get infected with Ebola by touching:infected animals when preparing, cooking or eating      them body fluids of an infected person such as saliva,      urine, faeces or semen things that have the body fluids of an infected person      like clothes or sheets.Ebola enters the body through cuts in the skin or when touching one’s eyes, nose or mouth.Early symptoms include fever, fatigue and headache. Some types of Ebola can be prevented with vaccines and treated with medicines.Ebola first appeared in 1976 in 2 simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now Nzara, South Sudan, and the other in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. The virus family Filoviridae includes 3 genera: Cuevavirus, Marburgvirus, and Ebolavirus. Within the genus Ebolavirus, 6 species have been identified: Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Taï Forest, Reston and Bombali. TransmissionIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.Ebola then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with:blood or body      fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola; and objects that have      been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, feces, vomit) from a      person sick with Ebola or the body of a person who died from Ebola.Health-care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola. This occurs through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Ebola.People remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. After recovery, there is the possibility of sexual transmission, which can be reduced with support and information for survivors. Pregnant women who get acute Ebola and recover from the disease may still carry the virus in breastmilk, or in pregnancy related fluids and tissues. For more, read the guidelines on the management of pregnancy and breastfeeding in Ebola.SymptomsThe symptoms of Ebola infection can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and internal and external bleeding.The time from when someone gets infected to having symptoms is usually from 2 to 21 days. A person with Ebola can only spread the disease once they have symptoms. People can spread Ebola for as long as their body contains the virus, even after they have died. After recovering from Ebola, some people may have symptoms for two years or longer. These symptoms can include: feeling tiredheadachemuscle and joint paineye pain and vision problemsweight gainbelly pain and loss of appetitehair loss and skin problemstrouble sleepingmemory losshearing lossdepression and anxiety.People should speak to a health-care professional if they have:symptoms and have been in an area known to have Ebola,      or been in contact with someone who may have had      Ebola.DiagnosisIt can be difficult to clinically distinguish Ebola virus disease from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Many symptoms of pregnancy and Ebola disease are also quite similar. Because of risks to the pregnancy and themselves, pregnant women should ideally be tested rapidly if Ebola is suspected.Confirmation that symptoms are caused by Ebola virus infection are made using the following diagnostic methods:antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen-capture detection testsserum neutralization testreverse transcriptase      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assayelectron microscopyvirus isolation      by cell culture.Diagnostic tests evaluated through the WHO emergency use assessment and listing process can be seen here. TreatmentPeople with symptoms of Ebola should get medical care immediately. Early care improves a person's chances of surviving Ebola. Treatment includes oral or intravenous fluids and medicines provided in the hospital. It is not safe to care for people with Ebola at home, because the person may make other people sick. At home, they will not receive the same level of care they can get from professionals.There is an effective vaccine for the Zaire type of Ebola, which is mostly found in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is treated with antibodies. These antibody medicines are given intravenously and increase the chances of survival. Research is ongoing to find vaccines and treatments for other types of Ebola. For all types of Ebola, supportive treatments save lives and include the following:oral or intravenous fluidsblood transfusionsmedicines for other infections the person may have, such as malariamedicines for pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.WHO has guidance that outlines the optimized supportive care Ebola patients should receive, from the relevant tests to administer, to managing pain, nutrition and co-infections (such as malaria), and other approaches that put the patient on the best path to recovery. In the 2018–2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients. WHO has living guidance on the recommended treatments and approaches. More information on Ebola clinical managementPrevention and controlPeople can protect themselves from getting Ebola by:washing handsavoiding touching the body fluids of people who have, or may have, Ebolanot touching the bodies of people who have died from Ebolagetting the Ebola vaccine if they are at risk for the Zaire type of Ebola.The Ervebo vaccine has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the species Zaire ebolavirus and is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools.WHO prequalifies Ebola vaccine, paving the way for its use in high-risk countriesGood outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe burials and social mobilisation. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures (including vaccination) that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on several factors:reducing the risk      of wildlife-to-human transmission reducing the risk      of human-to-human transmissionoutbreak containment measures, including safe and dignified burial of the deadreducing the risk      of possible sexual transmission reducing the risk      of transmission from pregnancy related fluids and tissue. Health-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe burial practices.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO has developed detailed advice on Ebola infection prevention and control:Infection prevention      and control guidance for care of patients with suspected or confirmed      Filovirus haemorrhagic fever in health-care settings, with focus on Ebola WHO responseWHO works with countries to prevent Ebola outbreaks by maintaining surveillance for Ebola virus disease and supporting at-risk countries to develop preparedness plans. This document provides overall guidance for control of Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks:Ebola and Marburg      virus disease epidemics: preparedness, alert, control, and evaluation When an outbreak is detected, WHO responds by supporting community engagement, disease detection, contact tracing, vaccination, case management, laboratory services, infection control, logistics, and training and assistance with safe and dignified burial practices.WHO has a range of advice and guidance for managing Ebola outbreaks: Clinical managementDisease outbreaksHealth product policy and standards - vaccine standardizationMedical devices for Ebola outbreakSexual and Reproductive Health and Research (SRH) and Ebola

What happened with the Chernobyl disaster?,"The Chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. The disaster was the worst nuclear accident in history, and it had far-reaching consequences for the environment, public health, and the global nuclear energy industry.

The disaster began when a control room operator at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant mistakenly tried to restart a reactor that was already shut down. The operator accidentally triggered a safety system designed to prevent such an event, leading to a catastrophic explosion and fire. The explosion released a large amount of radioactive materials into the atmosphere, causing widespread contamination of the surrounding area.

The immediate impact of the disaster was devastating. The explosion and fire destroyed Reactor No. 4, and the subsequent fire spread to other reactors at the plant. The fire lasted for several days, and it caused significant damage to the plant and surrounding areas. More than 300 people were killed in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, and many more died from radiation exposure in the years that followed.

The disaster had far-reaching consequences for the environment and public health. The release of radioactive materials into the atmosphere caused widespread contamination of the surrounding area, including the release of radioactive particles into nearby rivers and lakes. The contamination affected a large area of Ukraine and Belarus, and it also affected neighboring countries such as Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic.

The disaster also had significant economic impacts. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was shut down for several years after the disaster, and it was never fully repaired. The accident had a significant impact on the global nuclear energy industry, as countries that had relied on nuclear power for energy production began to reassess their use of nuclear power in the aftermath of the disaster.

The disaster also had significant psychological impacts. The disaster caused widespread trauma and fear among the people who lived in the surrounding area, and it left many people with long-term health effects. The disaster also had a significant impact on the global nuclear energy industry, as it led to a decline in public confidence in nuclear power and a shift towards renewable energy sources.",True,https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl/faqs,"

Frequently Asked Chernobyl Questions










    1. What caused the Chernobyl accident?  
On April 26, 1986, the Number Four RBMK reactor at the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine, went out of control during a test at low-power, leading to an explosion and fire that demolished the reactor building and released large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere. Safety measures were ignored, the uranium fuel in the reactor overheated and melted through the protective barriers. RBMK reactors do not have what is known as a containment structure, a concrete and steel dome over the reactor itself designed to keep radiation inside the plant in the event of such an accident. Consequently, radioactive elements including plutonium, iodine, strontium and caesium were scattered over a wide area. In addition, the graphite blocks used as a moderating material in the RBMK caught fire at high temperature as air entered the reactor core, which contributed to emission of radioactive materials into the environment.







    2. How many people died as an immediate result of the accident?  
The initial explosion resulted in the death of two workers. Twenty-eight of the firemen and emergency clean-up workers died in the first three months after the explosion from Acute Radiation Sickness and one of cardiac arrest.







    3. How many people were evacuated?  
The entire town of Pripyat (population 49 360), which lay only three kilometres from the plant was completely evacuated 36 hours after the accident. During the subsequent weeks and months an additional 67 000 people were evacuated from their homes in contaminated areas and relocated on government order. In total some 200 000 people are believed to have been relocated as a result of the accident.







    4. What are the major health effects for exposed populations?  
There have been at least 1800 documented cases of thyroid cancer children who were between 0 and 14 years of age when the accident occurred., which is far higher than normal. The thyroid gland of young children is particularly susceptible to the uptake of radioactive iodine, which can trigger cancers, treatable both by surgery and medication. Health studies of the registered cleanup workers called in (so-called “liquidators”) have failed to show any direct correlation between their radiation exposure and an increase in other forms of cancer or disease. The psychological affects of Chernobyl were and remain widespread and profound, and have resulted for instance in suicides, drinking problems and apathy.







    5. What radioactive elements were emitted into the environment?  
There were over 100 radioactive elements released into the atmosphere when Chernobyl’s fourth reactor exploded. Most of these were short lived and decayed (reduced in radioactivity) very quickly. Iodine, strontium and caesium were the most dangerous of the elements released, and have half-lives of 8 days, 29 years, and 30 years respectively. The isotopes Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 are therefore still present in the area to this day. While iodine is linked to thyroid cancer, Strontium can lead to leukaemia. Caesium is the element that travelled the farthest and lasts the longest. This element affects the entire body and especially can harm the liver and spleen.







    6. How large an area was affected by the radioactive fallout?  
Some 150,000 square kilometres in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine are contaminated and stretch northward of the plant site as far as 500 kilometres. An area spanning 30 kilometres around the plant is considered the “exclusion zone” and is essentially uninhabited. Radioactive fallout scattered over much of the northern hemisphere via wind and storm patterns, but the amounts dispersed were in many instances insignificant.







    7. How was this area cleaned up after the accident?  
Emergency workers (liquidators) were drafted into the area and helped to clean up the plant premises and the surrounding area. These workers were mostly plant employees, Ukrainian fire-fighters plus many soldiers and miners from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and other parts of the former Soviet Union. The exact number of liquidators is unknown because there are no completely accurate records of the people involved in the clean-up. The Russian registries list approximately 400,000 liquidators as of 1991 and approximately 600,000 people were granted the status of “liquidator”. These 600,000 individuals received special benefits because of their involvement, on- and off-site, in tackling the accident’s aftermath.The duties of the liquidators varied. They worked on decontamination and major construction projects, including the establishment of settlements and towns for plant workers and evacuees. They also built waste repositories, dams, water filtration systems and the “sarcophagus”, which entombs the entire fourth reactor to contain the remaining radioactive material.







    8. Was the rest of Europe/the world affected?  
Scandinavian countries and other parts of the world were affected by the radioactive releases from Chernobyl. Caesium and other radioactive isotopes were blown by wind northward into Sweden and Finland and over other parts of the northern hemisphere to some extent. During the first three weeks after the accident, the level of radiation in the atmosphere in several places around the globe was above normal; but these levels quickly receded. No studies have been able to point to a direct link between Chernobyl and increased cancer risks or other health problems outside the immediately affected republics of Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation.







    9. What happened to the environment and animals after the accident?  
Mutations did occur in plants and animals after the plant explosion. Leaves changed shape and some animals were born with physical deformities. Despite the increased radiation levels, rare species are now returning in large numbers to the area. These animals include beavers, moose, wolves and wild boar, plus species of birds.







    10. Is it safe to visit the area now?  
One may certainly visit the Chernobyl area, including even the exclusion zone, which is a 30 kilometre radius surrounding the plant, all of whose reactors are now closed. Although some of the radioactive isotopes released into the atmosphere still linger (such as Strontium-90 and Caesium-137), they are at tolerable exposure levels for limited periods of time. Some residents of the exclusion zone have returned to their homes at their own free will, and they live in areas with higher than normal environmental radiation levels. However, these levels are not fatal. Exposure to low but unusual levels of radiation over a period of time is less dangerous than exposure to a huge amount at once, and studies have been unable to link any direct increase in cancer risks to chronic low-level exposure.







    11. What was done to ensure the safety of other RBMK reactors, so that this scenario will not present itself again?  
Lessons learned from the accident were a significant driving force behind a decade of IAEA assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Much of this work focused on identifying the weaknesses in and improving the design safety of VVR and RBMK reactors. Upgrading was performed on all RBMK units to eliminate the design deficiencies which contributed to the Chernobyl accident, to improve shutdown mechanisms and heighten general safety awareness among staff. Just as important as the design safety work has been the focus on operational safety and on systems of regulatory oversight.







    12. How do the inhabitants live now?  
There are 187 small communities in the exclusion zone that remain virtually abandoned to this day. A few inhabitants chose to return to their homes in the exclusion zone, but children are not allowed to live in this area. The evacuated population lives mainly in newly constructed towns such as Slavutich in areas with very little or no contamination.







    13. What will happen to the plant now that it is closed?  
On December 15, 2000, the last reactor in operation at the Chernobyl site was shut down and the phase of decommissioning began. This involves the removal and disposal of fuel and wastes, decontamination of the plant and the area surrounding it, including any soil and water that may be radioactive. There are three retired reactors to be decommissioned on site, a project expected to take several decades. The project will be conducted under the supervision of the Ukrainian government. The IAEA will assist by providing planning, engineering and administrative advice. The fate of the fourth reactor where the tragic accident occurred in 1986 is as yet undetermined.







    14. What is the state of the protective shelter built around the fourth reactor?  
Under extremely hazardous conditions, thousands of ""Liquidators"" worked to contain the remains of the fourth reactor. The shelter surrounding the reactor was completed less than six months after the explosion during peak radioactivity levels. The massive concrete and steel ""Sarcophagus"", quickly constructed using ""arms length"" methods, has deteriorated over the years, creating a potentially hazardous situation. Several repairs were made to the current shelter, including the stabilisation of the ventilation stack and reinforcement of the roof. In addition, a plan for the construction of a more secure and permanent structure to be built around the existing Sarcophagus was drafted; work has already begun on the infrastructure of this new shelter. The plan, called the Shelter Implementation Plan, is a project of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. Both efforts, whose combined expected expenditures over the next eight or nine years exceed $765 million, are administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

Alert

Petya Ransomware 



Last RevisedFebruary 15, 2018

Alert CodeTA17-181A












Systems Affected

Microsoft Windows operating systems

Overview

This Alert has been updated to reflect the U.S. Government's public attribution of the ""NotPetya"" malware variant to the Russian military. Additional information may be found in a Statement from the White House Press Secretary. For more information related to NotPetya activity, go to https://www.us-cert.gov/grizzlysteppe.
The scope of this Alert’s analysis is limited to the newest Petya malware variant that surfaced on June 27, 2017. This malware is referred to as “NotPetya” throughout this Alert.
On June 27, 2017, NCCIC [13] was notified of Petya malware events occurring in multiple countries and affecting multiple sectors. This variant of the Petya malware—referred to as NotPetya—encrypts files with extensions from a hard-coded list. Additionally, if the malware gains administrator rights, it encrypts the master boot record (MBR), making the infected Windows computers unusable. NotPetya differs from previous Petya malware primarily in its propagation methods. 
The NCCIC Code Analysis Team produced a Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) to provide in-depth technical analysis of the malware. In coordination with public and private sector partners, NCCIC is also providing additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) in comma-separated-value (CSV) form for information sharing purposes.
Available Files:

MIFR-10130295.pdf
MIFR-10130295_stix.xml
TA-17-181B_IOCs.csv

NotPetya leverages multiple propagation methods to spread within an infected network. According to malware analysis, NotPetya attempts the lateral movement techniques below:

PsExec - a legitimate Windows administration tool
WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation, a legitimate Windows component
EternalBlue - the same Windows SMBv1 exploit used by WannaCry
EternalRomance - another Windows SMBv1 exploit

Microsoft released a security update for the MS17-010 SMB vulnerability on March 14, 2017, which addressed the EternalBlue and EternalRomance lateral movement techniques.
Technical Details
NCCIC received a sample of the NotPetya malware variant and performed a detailed analysis. Based on the analysis, NotPetya encrypts the victim’s files with a dynamically generated, 128-bit key and creates a unique ID of the victim. However, there is no evidence of a relationship between the encryption key and the victim’s ID, which means it may not be possible for the attacker to decrypt the victim’s files even if the ransom is paid. It behaves more like destructive malware rather than ransomware.
NCCIC observed multiple methods used by NotPetya to propagate across a network. The first and—in most cases—most effective method, uses a modified version of the Mimikatz tool to steal the user’s Windows credentials. The cyber threat actor can then use the stolen credentials, along with the native Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line (WMIC) tool or the Microsoft SysInternals utility, psexec.exe, to access other systems on the network. Another method for propagation uses the EternalBlue exploit tool to target unpatched systems running a vulnerable version of SMBv1. In this case, the malware attempts to identify other hosts on the network by checking the compromised system’s IP physical address mapping table. Next, it scans for other systems that are vulnerable to the SMB exploit and installs the malicious payload. Refer to the malware report, MIFR-10130295, for more details on these methods.
The analyzed sample of NotPetya encrypts the compromised system’s files with a 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm during runtime. The malware then writes a text file on the “C:\” drive that includes a static Bitcoin wallet location as well as unique personal installation key intended for the victim to use when making the ransom payment and the user’s Bitcoin wallet ID. NotPetya modifies the master boot record (MBR) to enable encryption of the master file table (MFT) and the original MBR, and then reboots the system. Based on the encryption methods used, it appears unlikely that the files could be restored, even if the attacker received the victim’s unique key and Bitcoin wallet ID.
The delivery mechanism of NotPetya during the June 27, 2017, event was determined to be the Ukrainian tax accounting software, M.E.Doc. The cyber threat actors used a backdoor to compromise M.E. Doc’s development environment as far back as April 14, 2017. This backdoor allowed the threat actor to run arbitrary commands, exfiltrate files, and download and execute arbitrary exploits on the affected system. Organizations should treat systems with M.E.Doc installed as suspicious, and should examine these systems for additional malicious activity. [12]

Impact

According to multiple reports, this NotPetya malware campaign has infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare. While these victims are business entities, other Windows systems are also at risk, such as:

those that do not have patches installed for the vulnerabilities in MS17‑010, CVE-2017-0144, and CVE-2017-0145, and
those who operate on the  shared network of affected organizations.

Negative consequences of malware infection include:

temporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,
disruption to regular operations,
financial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and
potential harm to an organization’s reputation.


Solution

NCCIC recommends against paying ransoms; doing so enriches malicious actors while offering no guarantee that the encrypted files will be released. In this NotPetya incident, the email address for payment validation was shut down by the email provider, so payment is especially unlikely to lead to data recovery.[1] According to one NCCIC stakeholder, the sites listed below sites are used for payment in this activity. These sites are not included in the CSV package as IOCs.

Network Signatures
NCCIC recommends that organizations coordinate with their security vendors to ensure appropriate coverage for this threat. Given the overlap of functionality and the similarity of behaviors between WannaCry and NotPetya, many of the available rulesets can protect against both malware types when appropriately implemented.

Recommended Steps for Prevention
Review US-CERT’s Alert on The Increasing Threat to Network Infrastructure Devices and Recommended Mitigations [6], and consider implementing the following best practices:

Ensure you have fully patched your systems, and confirm that you have applied Microsoft’s patch for the MS17-010 SMB vulnerability dated March 14, 2017.[5]
Conduct regular backups of data and test your backups regularly as part of a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.
Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware solutions are set to automatically conduct regular scans.
Manage the use of privileged accounts. Implement the principle of least privilege. Do not assign administrative access to users unless absolutely needed. Those with a need for administrator accounts should only use them when necessary. 
Configure access controls, including file, directory, and network share permissions with the principle of least privilege in mind. If a user only needs to read specific files, they should not have write access to those files, directories, or shares. 
Secure use of WMI by authorizing WMI users and setting permissions.
Utilize host-based firewalls and block workstation-to-workstation communications to limit unnecessary lateral communications.
Disable or limit remote WMI and file sharing.
Block remote execution through PSEXEC.
Segregate networks and functions.
Harden network devices and secure access to infrastructure devices.
Perform out-of-band network management.
Validate integrity of hardware and software.
Disable SMBv1 and block all versions of SMB at the network boundary by blocking TCP port 445 with related protocols on UDP ports 137-138 and TCP port 139; this applies to all boundary devices.

Note: Disabling or blocking SMB may create problems by obstructing access to shared files, data, or devices. Weigh the benefits of mitigation against potential disruptions to users.
Recommended Steps for Remediation

NCCIC strongly encourages organizations contact a local Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field office upon discovery to report an intrusion and request assistance. Maintain and provide relevant logs.
Implement a security incident response and business continuity plan. Ideally, organizations should ensure they have appropriate backups so their response is simply to restore the data from a known clean backup. 

Report Notice
DHS encourages recipients who identify the use of tools or techniques discussed in this document to report information to DHS or law enforcement immediately. To request incident response resources or technical assistance, contact NCCIC at NCCICcustomerservice@hq.dhs.gov or 888-282-0870.

"
What is the Hawthorne Effect?,"The Hawthorne Effect is a phenomenon that occurs when employees become more aware of the fact that they are being observed and their behavior changes as a result. The Hawthorne Effect was first discovered in a series of studies conducted by Elton Mayo, an American sociologist and researcher, in the 1920s and 1930s at Western Electric's Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois.

The studies involved the observation of the behavior of workers in a factory setting. Mayo and his team observed that when workers were given more control over their working conditions and their behavior changed as a result. They found that workers were more productive and exhibited better performance when they were given more autonomy and control over their work environment.

The Hawthorne Effect has been studied extensively since the original studies and has been found to occur in a wide range of settings, including workplaces, schools, and even government agencies. The effect has been found to be particularly strong in settings where employees are given more autonomy and control over their work environment, such as when they have the ability to choose their own work schedules, work in teams, or have access to training and development opportunities.

For example, in a study conducted at a large corporation, workers who were given more autonomy and control over their work environment showed a significant increase in productivity and a decrease in absenteeism. Similarly, in a study conducted at a university, students who were given more autonomy and control over their learning environment showed a significant increase in academic performance and a decrease in drop-out rates.

Overall, the Hawthorne Effect is a powerful reminder of the importance of employee engagement and motivation in the workplace. By recognizing and understanding the impact of observation and control on worker behavior, organizations can create a more productive and engaged workforce.",True,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3969247/,"

Abstract
Objectives
This study aims to (1) elucidate whether the Hawthorne effect exists, (2) explore under what conditions, and (3) estimate the size of any such effect.Study Design and Setting
This systematic review summarizes and evaluates the strength of available evidence on the Hawthorne effect. An inclusive definition of any form of research artifact on behavior using this label, and without cointerventions, was adopted.Results
Nineteen purposively designed studies were included, providing quantitative data on the size of the effect in eight randomized controlled trials, five quasiexperimental studies, and six observational evaluations of reporting on one's behavior by answering questions or being directly observed and being aware of being studied. Although all but one study was undertaken within health sciences, study methods, contexts, and findings were highly heterogeneous. Most studies reported some evidence of an effect, although significant biases are judged likely because of the complexity of the evaluation object.Conclusion
Consequences of research participation for behaviors being investigated do exist, although little can be securely known about the conditions under which they operate, their mechanisms of effects, or their magnitudes. New concepts are needed to guide empirical studies.Keywords: Hawthorne effect, Reactivity, Observation, Research methods, Research participation, Assessment1. Introduction
What is new?


•Most of the 19 purposively designed evaluation studies included in this systematic review provide some evidence of research participation effects.


•The heterogeneity of these studies means that little can be confidently inferred about the size of these effects, the conditions under which they operate, or their mechanisms.


•There is a clear need to rectify the limited development of study of the issues represented by the Hawthorne effect as they indicate potential for profound biases.


•As the Hawthorne effect construct has not successfully led to important research advances in this area over a period of 60 years, new concepts are needed to guide empirical studies.

The Hawthorne effect concerns research participation, the consequent awareness of being studied, and possible impact on behavior [1-5]. It is a widely used research term. The original studies that gave rise to the Hawthorne effect were undertaken at Western Electric telephone manufacturing factory at Hawthorne, near Chicago, between 1924 and 1933 [6-8]. Increases in productivity were observed among a selected group of workers who were supervised intensively by managers under the auspices of a research program. The term was first used in an influential methodology textbook in 1953 [9]. A large literature and repeated controversies have evolved over many decades as to the nature of the Hawthorne effect [5,10]. If there is a Hawthorne effect, studies could be biased in ways that we do not understand well, with profound implications for research [11].
Empirical data on the Hawthorne effect have not previously been evaluated in a systematic review. Early reviews examined a body of literature on studies of school children and found no evidence of a Hawthorne effect as the term had been used in that literature [12-14]. The contemporary relevance of the Hawthorne effect is clearer within health sciences, in which recent years have seen an upsurge in applications of this construct in relation to a range of methodological phenomena (see examples of studies with nonbehavioral outcomes [15-17]).
There are two main ways in which the construct of the Hawthorne effect has previously been used in the research literature. First, there are studies that purport to explain some aspect of the findings of the original Hawthorne studies. These studies involve secondary quantitative data analyses [1,18-20] or discussions of the Hawthorne effect, which offer interpretations based on other material [4,10,21,22]. The Hawthorne effect has also been widely used without any necessary connection to the original studies and has usually taken on the meaning of alteration in behavior as a consequence of its observation or other study. In contrast to uses of the term in relation to the original Hawthorne studies, methodological versions of the Hawthorne effect have mutated in meaning over time and across disciplines and been the subject of much controversy [1,2,4,23,24]. This diversity means that certain aspects of the putative Hawthorne effect, for example, novelty [25] are emphasized in some studies and are absent in many others.
There is a widespread social psychological explanation of the possible mechanism for the Hawthorne effect as follows. Awareness of being observed or having behavior assessed engenders beliefs about researcher expectations. Conformity and social desirability considerations then lead behavior to change in line with these expectations. Chiesa and Hobbs [5] point out that just as there are different meanings given to the purported Hawthorne effect, there are also many suggested mechanisms producing the effect, some of which are contradictory. In all likelihood, the most common use of the Hawthorne effect term is as a post hoc interpretation of unexpected study findings, particularly where they are disappointing, for example, when there are null findings in trials.
The aims of this systematic review were to elucidate whether the Hawthorne effect exists, explore under what conditions, and estimate the size of any such effect, by summarizing and evaluating the strength of evidence available in all scientific disciplines. Meeting these study aims contributes to an overarching orientation to better understand whether research participation itself influences behavior. This inclusive orientation eschews restrictions on participants, study designs, and precise definitions of the content of Hawthorne effect manipulations.2. Methods
The Hawthorne effect under investigation is any form of artifact or consequence of research participation on behavior.
Studies were included if they were based on empirical research comprising either primary or secondary data analyses; were published in English language peer-reviewed journals; were purposively designed to determine the presence of, or measure the size of, the Hawthorne effect, as stated in the introduction or methods sections of the article or before the presentation of findings if the report is not organized in this way; and reported quantitative data on the Hawthorne effect on a behavioral outcome either in observational designs comparing measures taken before and after a dedicated research manipulation or between groups in randomized or nonrandomized experimental studies. Behavioral outcomes incorporate direct measures of behavior and also the consequences of specific behaviors. Studies that described their aims in other ways and also referred to the Hawthorne effect as an alternative conceptualization of the object of evaluation were included as were studies that have other primary aims such as the evaluation of an intervention in a trial in which assessment of the Hawthorne effect is clearly stated as a secondary aim of the study, for example, with the incorporation of control groups with and without Hawthorne effect characteristics. Studies were excluded if: unpublished or in grey literature on the grounds that it is not possible to systematically assess these literature in an unbiased manner; discussion articles and commentaries were not considered to constitute empirical research; they referenced or used the term Hawthorne effect incidentally or described it as a design feature or as part of the study context, or invoked it as an explanation for study findings. Studies of the Hawthorne effect that incorporate nonresearch components, including cointerventions such as feedback, hamper evaluation and are also excluded, as were reanalyses of the original Hawthorne factory data set by virtue of nonresearch cointerventions such as managerial changes (see Ref. [8] for a detailed history of the studies).
Studies were primarily identified in electronic databases. In addition, included studies and key excluded references were backward searched for additional references and forward searched to identify reports that cited these articles. Experts identified in included studies and elsewhere were contacted. The most recent database searches took place on January 3, 2012 for the following databases: Web of Science (1970-), MEDLINE (1950-), BIOSIS Previews (1969-), PsycInfo (1806-), CINAHL Plus with full text (1937-), ERIC (1966-), PubMed (1950-), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1947-), Embase (1947-), Sociological Abstracts (1952-), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts (NCJRS; 1970-), Social Services Abstracts (1979-), Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA; 1973-), the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (1951-), APPI Journals (1844-), British Nursing Index (1992-), ADOLEC (1980-), Social Policy and Practice (1890-), British Humanities Index (1962-), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstract (1987-), Inspec (1969-), and PsycARTICLES (1988-).
The term ""Hawthorne effect"" was searched for as a phrase as widely as possible. If the database permitted, the term was searched for in all fields as was the case for Embase, CINAHL, ERIC, and others. In the Web of Knowledge search, which uses Web of Science, MEDLINE, and BIOSIS Previews databases, ""Hawthorne effect"" was entered into the ""topic"" field. The term was also searched for in ""keyword"" fields for databases such as NCJRS, LLBA, APPI, and others. The use of this term as the core object of evaluation negated the need for a more complex search strategy.
Hits from the database searches were downloaded into EndNote software (Thomson Reuters), removing duplicates there. Screening of titles and abstracts was undertaken by the second author or a research assistant. After a further brief screen of full-text articles, potential inclusions were independently assessed before being included. Data extracted are summarized in the tables presented here, which also contain information on risk of bias in individual studies. Binary outcomes were meta-analyzed in Stata, version 12 (Statacorp), with outcomes pooled in random-effects models using the method by DerSimonian and Laird. The Q and I2 statistics [26] were used to evaluate the extent and effects of heterogeneity, and outcomes are stratified by study design. Formal methods were not used to assess risk of bias within and across studies, and narrative consideration is given to both. We did not publish a protocol for this review.3. Results
Nineteen studies were eligible for inclusion in this review [27-45]. The PRISMA flowchart summarizing the data collection process is presented in Fig. 1. The design characteristics of included studies, along with brief summaries of outcome data and observations on most likely sources of bias, are presented separately for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasiexperimental studies, and observational studies in Tables 1-3, respectively. All included studies apart from one [27] have been undertaken within health sciences. All observational studies were studies of the Hawthorne effect on health-care practitioners, as were two of the quasiexperimental studies [37,39]. Although none of the randomized trials evaluate possible effects on health-care practitioners, the study by Van Rooyen et al. [28] was undertaken with health researchers. The quasiexperimental studies tend to have been conducted before both the RCTs and observational studies, for which the clear majority of both types of studies have been reported within the past decade. The oldest included study was published approximately 25 years ago [35]. Four of the 5 quasiexperimental studies used some form of quasirandomized methods in constructing control groups (except Ref. [36]). Heterogeneity in operationalization of the Hawthorne effect for dedicated evaluations, in study populations, settings, and in other ways, is readily apparent in Tables 1-3.

Study led to increases in 2 of 3 recording outcomes (medication and allergy, not medical history). Regression coefficients and P values reported.
Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in viral cases was 29% lower when observed (46% vs. 17%)
AHR compliance increased from 29% to 45% during the overt observation period (OR, 2.33; 95% CI: 1.95, 2.78; higher in multivariate model)
Patient-reported quality of care increased by 13% with direct observation, and returned to preobservation levels between 10 and 15 consultations
Both observed periods saw similar increases in compliance (47-55% and 48-56%).
No differences in main analysis (67.9% vs. 68.5% control/study). Possible difference in expected direction in small subgroup of heavy babies (37% vs. 53% control/study)


Reviewer comments including on principal risks of bias
No evaluation of confounding. Differences seen after awareness-raising memo, effect may be contingent.
Information bias judged likely. Reporting complex.
Big difference in indications for use in two periods reflects different observation procedures. Observer bias also possible.
Both the analyses and the reporting of outcome data are complex.
Not a formal report, so scant detail on data collection and other study procedures.
Equivalence problematic, clinicians different in two periods, although baby characteristics similar.

These data are presented in Fig. 2. The first six studies presented in Fig. 2 comprise six of the seven (not including Ref. [32]) evaluations of the effects of reporting on one's behavior by answering questions either in interviews or by completing questionnaires. All other studies evaluate being directly observed and/or the awareness of being studied in various ways, apart from one study that combines both types of Hawthorne effect manipulation [33].

Binary outcome data. RR, relative risk; CI, confidence interval.As a result of heterogeneity in definitions of the Hawthorne effect (reflecting the inclusion criteria), findings from meta-analytic syntheses should be treated with caution. Explorations of the extent and effects of heterogeneity are presented in Table 4. Pronounced effects of statistical heterogeneity are reflected in the I2 statistics for two of the three study designs (RCTs and observational studies) and also when attention is restricted to the eight studies of being observed or studied and to the subset of six studies of answering questions, and overall. When the one interview study (of preelection interview effects on voter turnout [27]) is removed, however, to leave five studies of the effects of self-completing questionnaires on health behaviors, statistical heterogeneity is markedly attenuated.

Bearing these explorations of heterogeneity in mind, effect estimates provide a confidence interval (CI) including unity for the five trials alone [odds ratio (OR), 1.06; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.14], and for the six studies of answering questions (OR, 1.07; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.15). They reach statistical significance in relation to the five studies of self-completing health questionnaires (OR, 1.11; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.23). The pooled estimate for the five quasiexperimental studies is similar to that for the five trials and is not statistically significant (OR, 1.07; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.17), whereas that for the four observational studies (OR, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.30) and the eight studies of being observed (OR, 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.41) are larger and statistically significant. The overall odds ratio, without any weighting for study design, was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.30).
Quantitative outcome data were presented in three of the other five studies; two identifying between-group differences [29,32] and one not [28]. The large effect in the study by Feil et al. [29] is noteworthy. In the remaining two studies, continuous measures of effect were not reported in the form of mean differences and were complex to interpret, although both reported statistically significant Hawthorne effect findings [40,43]. Continuous outcomes were also evaluated for two studies included in Fig. 1, with both finding evidence of statistically significant effects [33,35].
Of the 19 studies, therefore, 12 provided at least some evidence of the existence of a Hawthorne effect, however this was defined, to a statistically significant degree. Small sample sizes appeared to preclude between-group differences reaching statistical significance in two studies [31,36]. In five studies, it was judged clear that there were no between-group differences that could represent a possible Hawthorne effect [28,37-39,45].4. Discussion
The Hawthorne effect has been operationalized for study as the effects of reporting on one's behavior by answering questions, being directly observed, or otherwise made aware of being studied. There is evidence of effects across these studies, and inconsistencies in this evidence. We explore heterogeneity in targets for, and methods of, study as well as in findings. We will begin by examining the evidence base for each of the study designs, before considering the limitations, interpretation, and implications of this study.
The RCTs tend to provide evidence of small statistically significant effects. There are also studies that showed no effects, and two studies that provided evidence of large effects [29,34]. The study by Feil et al. [29] used a strong manipulation, incorporating a placebo effect, which is not usually considered to be a Hawthorne effect component, in addition to research- and trial-specific participation effects. In both this study and the one undertaken by Evans et al. [34] also finding a large effect, small numbers of participants are involved. The diversity in the content of the manipulations in these studies is emphasized. When one considers the RCT data from the five studies contributing to the meta-analysis [27,30,31,33,34] alongside the three studies that did not, two of which produce statistically significant effects on continuous outcomes [29,32], it seems that overall, there is evidence of between-group differences in the RCTs. These between-group differences cannot, however, be interpreted to provide consistent or coherent evidence of a single effect.
The same could be said of the diversity of the contents of the manipulations in the quasiexperimental studies, and the picture is made more complex by greater variability in study design features, particularly in relation to allocation methods. Overall, they produce mixed evidence, with a between-group difference in one study [35], a noteworthy difference in a small underpowered study [36], and no evidence of between-group differences in the other three studies [37-39]. It is difficult to draw any conclusion from included studies with quasiexperimental designs.
Although their design precludes strong conclusions because of the likelihood of unknown and uncontrolled biases, the heterogeneity of findings in the observational studies is interesting. Two studies produce identical point estimates of effects [41,42], whereas the other two estimates are similarly different [44,45]. These data suggest that the size of any effects of health-care practitioners being observed or being aware of being studied probably very much depends on what exactly they are doing. Perhaps, this is not at all surprising, although it does undermine further the idea that there is a single effect, which can be called the Hawthorne effect. Rather, the effect, if it exists, is highly contingent on task and context. It is noteworthy that the three other studies with health professionals, all using control groups, show no effects [28,37,39].
This is an ""apples and oranges"" review. This approach was judged appropriate, given the current level of understanding of the phenomena under investigation. This design decision does, however, entail limitations in the forms of important differences between studies, including operationalization of the Hawthorne effect, and exposure to varying forms of bias. The observed effects are short term when a follow-up study is involved, with only the studies by Murray et al. [35] and Kypri et al. [32] demonstrating effects beyond 6 months. Both these studies involved repeated prior assessments, and both provide self-reported outcome data. Self-reported outcomes do not appear obviously more likely than objectively ascertained outcomes to show effects. The forms of blinding used are often tailored to the nature of the study, making performance bias prevention difficult to evaluate across the studies as a whole.
By design, we have excluded studies that defined the object of evaluation to incorporate nonresearch elements as occurred in the original studies at Hawthorne [8]. We may have missed studies that should have been identified, although this is unlikely if use of the Hawthorne effect term was in any way prominent. Studies that have been missed may be more likely to be older and from nonhealth literature. An alternative design for this study might have eschewed this label and sought instead to synthesize findings on studies of research participation and/or awareness of being studied. Although potentially attractive, this course of action would have involved considerable difficulties in identifying relevant material and would risk losing the main focus on the Hawthorne effect. Similarly, we might have also included studies with cognitive and/or emotional outcomes in which effects might be greater [46], rather than focusing on behavioral outcomes. This possibility may be appropriate for evaluation in the future. Although we have sought to make our explorations of the heterogeneity of included studies as informative as possible, our analyses might be seen as excessive data fishing. These are, however, clearly presented as post hoc analyses after examination of high levels of heterogeneity, and the study by Granberg and Holmberg [27] is distinct from the other four questionnaire studies in a range of ways including the behavior being investigated.
Heterogeneity in operationalization of the Hawthorne effect make the data in this review challenging to interpret, yet it does appear that research participation can and does influence behavior, at least in some circumstances. The content and strength of the Hawthorne effect manipulations vary in these primary studies, and so to do the effects, although it would not be possible to discern any form of dose-response relationship. The manipulation by Evans et al. [34] may appear in some respects weak, for example, being an online questionnaire, and in others as potentially strong, examining decision making in relation to uptake of a cancer test, which was the study outcome. Although weak uses of the Hawthorne effect term in the wider literature mean that it is not very informative for interpreting the data from this study, outcomes may be considered in relation to the prevailing ideas about the core mechanism of the Hawthorne effect that conformity to perceived norms or researcher expectations drives change. Many, but not all, of the studies with positive findings appear broadly consistent with this account, although so too do many of the studies with negative findings and it is not clear why this is so. The study by Murray et al. [35] examined adolescent smoking at a time when the prevalences of both nonsmoking and regular smoking were approximately one-quarter in this sample, so it is unclear what norms or perceptions of researcher expectations many have been. This study exemplifies the literature as a whole in being principally concerned with the possible existence of a Hawthorne effect and not being designed to test the hypothesized mechanism.
There are other possible mechanisms of effect that have also not been evaluated. For example, regardless of perceptions of norms or researcher expectations, the content of the questions asked may themselves stimulate new thinking. In the studies by Evans et al. [34] and O'Sullivan et al. [30], patients may well not have previously considered what was being enquired about, and this may have been an independent source of change. Concerns about biases being introduced by having research participants complete questionnaires have existed for more than 100 years, before the Hawthorne factory studies took place and approximately 50 years before the Hawthorne effect term was introduced to the literature (see Ref. [47] for an early history of these issues). Given how long the Hawthorne effect construct has been the predominant conceptualization of these phenomena [48], it appears that this construct is an inadequate vehicle for advancing understanding of these issues. Alternative long-standing conceptualizations of these problems such as demand characteristics within psychology have also yielded disappointingly underdeveloped research literatures [49-51]. This state of affairs points toward an obvious need for further study of whether, when, how, how much, and for whom research participation may impact on behavior or other study outcomes.
Further studies will be assisted by the development of a conceptual framework that elaborates possible mechanisms of effects and thus targets for study. The Hawthorne effect label has probably stuck for so long simply because we have not advanced our understanding of the issues it represents. We suggest that unqualified use of the term should be abandoned. Specification of the research issues being investigated or described is paramount, regardless of whether the Hawthorne label is seen to be useful or to apply or not in any particular research context. Perhaps, use of the label should be restricted to evaluations in which conformity and social desirability considerations are involved, although it is striking how hostile social psychology has been to this construct [2]. So, what can be said about priority targets for further study on the basis of this systematic review and what concepts are available to guide further study?
Decisions to take part in research studies may also be implicated in efforts to address behavior in other ways so that research participation interacts with other forces influencing behavior. It is also possible, if not likely, that these relatively well-studied types of data collection (completing questionnaires and being observed) are part of a series of events that occur for participants in research studies that have potential to shape their behavior, from recruitment onwards. Giving attention to precisely what we invite research participants to do in any given study seems a logical precursor to examination of whether any aspect of taking part may influence them. Phenomenological studies, which ask participants about their experiences, would seem to be useful for developing new concepts. If individual study contexts are indeed important, we should expect to see effects that vary in size and across populations and research contexts, and perhaps also with multiple mechanisms of effects. The underdeveloped nature of these types of research questions means that it may be unwise to articulate advanced conceptual frameworks to guide empirical study. We propose ""research participation effects"" as a starting point for this type of thinking. Although descriptive, it also invites investigation of other aspects of the research process beyond data collection, which may simply be where research artifacts emanating from both social norms and other sources are most obvious.
We conclude that there is no single Hawthorne effect. Consequences of research participation for behaviors being investigated have been found to exist in most studies included within this review, although little can be securely known about the conditions under which they operate, their mechanisms of effects, or their magnitudes. Further research on this subject should be a priority for the health sciences, in which we might expect change induced by research participation to be in the direction of better health and thus likely to be confounded with the outcomes being studied. It is also important for other domains of research on human behavior to rectify the limited development of understanding of the issues represented by the Hawthorne effect as they suggest the possibility of profound biases.Acknowledgments

"
What is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program?,"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a U.S. government program that provides temporary deportation relief and work permits to certain young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The program was established in 2012 by President Barack Obama, and has since been extended by three subsequent presidents.

Here are some specific details and examples of the DACA program:

* Eligibility: To be eligible for DACA, an individual must have been brought to the United States as a child, must have been under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, must have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, must have entered the United States before their 16th birthday, must be currently in school, college, or a vocational or other technical program, and must have not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors.
* Application Process: To apply for DACA, an individual must submit a form online, along with documents such as a birth certificate, a social security card, and a copy of their driver's license or state identification card. The application process is free, and no fees are required.
* Approval Process: Once the application is submitted, the individual's application is reviewed by a government official. If the individual meets the eligibility requirements, their application is approved, and they are issued a work permit and a ""deferred action"" allowing them to remain in the United States without fear of deportation. If the individual's application is denied, they are informed of the reasons for the denial and given the opportunity to appeal.
* Renewal Process: Once an individual's DACA status has been approved, they are eligible to renew their status every two years. The renewal process is similar to the original application process, and the individual must submit a new form and provide updated documents.
* Expansion: The DACA program has been expanded several times since its inception. In 2014, President Obama expanded the program to cover certain young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as children. In 2015, President Obama expanded the program to cover certain young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as children, regardless of whether they had been in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007. In 2017, President Trump ended the program, but in 2020, President Biden expanded the program to cover certain young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as children, regardless of whether they had been in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007.

Overall, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has provided temporary relief and work permits to thousands of young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, and has been expanded and renewed several times since its inception.",True,https://www.uscis.gov/DACA,"

Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)





Alert Type info

ALERT: Important Update on Deferred Action for Childhood ArrivalsOn Jan. 17, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision regarding the DACA Final Rule. Pursuant to the court’s order, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. USCIS will continue to accept initial requests but will not process initial DACA requests at this time. Current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated.

ALERT: Important Reminders Regarding the DACA Renewal Process



We continue to adjudicate the majority of DACA renewal requests within 120 days and make every effort to efficiently process these requests as we receive them. USCIS Historical Data shows the median processing time for DACA renewals and associated Employment Authorization Documents in fiscal year 2023 was 1 month, and less than 2 months for the first quarter of FY 2024.As USCIS has long recommended, we strongly encourage DACA recipients to submit your DACA renewal request to us between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Please note that filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision.

ALERT: Court decisions regarding DACA.



On Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the DACA Final Rule unlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021 injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” See the Memorandum and Order and Supplemental Order of Injunction.Accordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated.  In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, as it has since October 31, 2022. We will also continue to accept initial DACA requests, but in accordance with the District Court’s order, we will not process initial DACA requests.Current valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.Please see the DACA Litigation Information Page for important updates and information related to court rulings on the DACA policy.





This page provides information on requesting Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). You may request DACA for the first time or renew your existing period of DACA if it is expiring. Please note: While a July 16, 2021, injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was  affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and on Oct. 14, 2022 was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect, DHS is prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule.File Online
 


What Is DACAOn June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible to request work authorization. Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful status.On Aug. 30, 2022, DHS published the DACA Final Rule, with the intent to preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Memorandum issued by Secretary Napolitano.Request DACA for the First TimeThe following information explains the guidelines for requesting DACA for the first time. Please note: While a July 16, 2021, injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and on Oct. 14, 2022 was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect, DHS is prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule. If you need further information and cannot find it in our Frequently Asked Questions, you can call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283.

For more information on notices to appear, visit uscis.gov/NTA.Administrative ErrorsYou may request a review using the Service Request Management Tool process if you met all of the DACA guidelines and you believe USCIS denied your request because of an administrative error.Examples:USCIS believes you abandoned your case by not responding to a request for evidence (RFE), and you believe you did respond within the prescribed time; orUSCIS mailed the RFE to the wrong address, even though you had submitted a Form AR-11, Change of Address, or changed your address online at uscis.gov before we issued the RFE.You can find a full list of possible errors in our Frequently Asked Questions.To make a service request, you must call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283. For people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833. A USCIS representative will then forward your request to the proper USCIS office. Your service request will be reviewed for accuracy and USCIS will send you a letter informing you of its decision.The USCIS Contact Center is open Monday – Friday from 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Eastern Time.Travel InformationCertain travel outside the United States may affect the continuous residence guideline. Traveling outside the United States before Aug. 15, 2012, will not interrupt your continuous residence if the travel was brief, casual, and innocent. If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before we make a decision on your request for DACA, you will not be considered for DACA.The following chart explains whether your travel will affect your continuous residence.Travel DatesType of TravelDoes it Affect Continuous ResidenceOn or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012Brief,Casual, andInnocentNoFor an extended timeBecause of an order of exclusion, deportation, or removalTo participate in criminal activityYesOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACAAnyYes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACAAnyYes. You cannot travel while your request is under review. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case.In addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after receiving DACAAnyIt depends.  If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence.  However, if you engage in unauthorized travel, the travel may interrupt your continuous residence.Once USCIS has approved your request for DACA, you may file Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States. If you travel outside the United States without first receiving advance parole and then enter the United States without inspection, USCIS may terminate your DACA after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond. DACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States; obtaining an advance parole document prior to departure is strongly encouraged to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA.For detailed information see the Travel section of the Frequently Asked Questions.National Security and Public Safety GuidelinesYou will not be considered for DACA if you have been convicted of:A felony offense;A significant misdemeanor offense (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)); or3 or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct.OrYou are otherwise deemed to pose a threat to national security or public safety.What is the difference between a “significant misdemeanor” (a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)), a “non-significant misdemeanor” (other misdemeanor), and a “felony”?FelonySignificant Misdemeanor (a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))Non-significant Misdemeanor (an “other misdemeanor” referenced at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year.A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.A significant misdemeanor (that is, a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) and:Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; or,If not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence.A single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.A crime is considered a non-significant misdemeanor (referred to as “other misdemeanor” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) and:Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; andIs an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less.Three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA.A minor traffic offense is not considered a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) and is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. DHS considers such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine if a requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. However, driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) regardless of the sentence imposed.  You can find detailed information in the Criminal Convictions section of the Frequent Asked Questions.Don’t Be a Victim of Immigration ScamsDishonest practitioners may promise to provide you with faster services if you pay them a fee.

What is the moral debate over animal testing in scientific research?,"There is a long-standing moral debate over the use of animals in scientific research, with some arguing that it is necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of human medicines, while others believe that it is unethical and should be stopped.

One of the key arguments against animal testing is that it is not a reliable way to predict how a drug will behave in humans. Many drugs that have been tested on animals have failed to work as expected in clinical trials, leading to delays and cost overruns in drug development.

However, supporters of animal testing argue that it is a necessary evil, and that the benefits of new drugs and treatments outweigh the harm caused to animals. They point to the fact that animal testing has led to the development of many important drugs and treatments, including penicillin, aspirin, and insulin.

One example of the use of animal testing in medical research is the development of the rabies vaccine. In the 1950s, researchers discovered that a virus called rabies was responsible for the disease, but they were unable to find a vaccine that was effective in animals. They then began testing the vaccine on a variety of animals, including monkeys, dogs, and cats, before eventually developing a successful vaccine that can protect humans from the virus.

Another example is the use of animals in the development of painkillers. In the 1960s, researchers discovered that a drug called morphine was effective in treating pain, but it was also addictive. To find a safer and more effective painkiller, researchers began testing the drug on animals, including rats and dogs, before eventually developing a painkiller called codeine.

However, animal testing is not without controversy, and many people argue that it is not a humane way to conduct medical research. Some people believe that animals should not be used as test subjects, and that there are other ways to conduct research, such as computer simulations or cell cultures.

One example of the use of animal testing in medical research is the use of primates in the development of new drugs. Primates, including monkeys and apes, are often used in research because they are similar to humans in terms of their anatomy and physiology. However, many people argue that this is not a valid reason to use animals in research, as primates are not the same as humans, and that there are other ways to conduct research that do not involve using animals.

Another example of the use of animal testing in medical research is the use of mice in drug discovery. Mice are small, simple animals that are easy to work with, and they are used to test the effects of drugs on a variety of biological systems. However, some people argue that this is not a valid reason to use animals in research, as mice are not the same as humans, and that there are other ways to conduct research that do not involve using animals.

Overall, the use of animals in medical research is a complex issue, with many people arguing for and against it. Some people believe that it is necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of human medicines, while others believe that it is unethical and should be stopped. Ultimately, the decision to use animals in medical research is a complex one, and it will depend on the specific circumstances and the arguments on both sides.",True,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9710398/,"

Summary
Animal experimentation is widely used around the world for the identification of the root causes of various diseases in humans and animals and for exploring treatment options. Among the several animal species, rats, mice and purpose-bred birds comprise almost 90% of the animals that are used for research purpose. However, growing awareness of the sentience of animals and their experience of pain and suffering has led to strong opposition to animal research among many scientists and the general public. In addition, the usefulness of extrapolating animal data to humans has been questioned. This has led to Ethical Committees’ adoption of the ‘four Rs’ principles (Reduction, Refinement, Replacement and Responsibility) as a guide when making decisions regarding animal experimentation. Some of the essential considerations for humane animal experimentation are presented in this review along with the requirement for investigator training. Due to the ethical issues surrounding the use of animals in experimentation, their use is declining in those research areas where alternative in vitro or in silico methods are available. However, so far it has not been possible to dispense with experimental animals completely and further research is needed to provide a road map to robust alternatives before their use can be fully discontinued.

Ethical considerations regarding animal experimentation. J Prev Med Hyg 2022;63(suppl.3):E255-E266. https://doi.org/10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2022.63.2S3.2768Introduction
Animal model-based research has been performed for a very long time. Ever since the 5th century B.C., reports of experiments involving animals have been documented, but an increase in the frequency of their utilization has been observed since the 19th century [1]. Most institutions for medical research around the world use non-human animals as experimental subjects [2]. Such animals might be used for research experimentations to gain a better understanding of human diseases or for exploring potential treatment options [2]. Even those animals that are evolutionarily quite distant from humans, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Caenorhabditis elegans, share physiological and genetic similarities with human beings [2]; therefore animal experimentation can be of great help for the advancement of medical science [2].
For animal experimentation, the major assumption is that the animal research will be of benefit to humans. There are many reasons that highlight the significance of animal use in biomedical research. One of the major reasons is that animals and humans share the same biological processes. In addition, vertebrates have many anatomical similarities (all vertebrates have lungs, a heart, kidneys, liver and other organs) [3]. Therefore, these similarities make certain animals more suitable for experiments and for providing basic training to young researchers and students in different fields of biological and biomedical sciences [3]. Certain animals are susceptible to various health problems that are similar to human diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease [4]. Furthermore, there are genetically modified animals that are used to obtain pathological phenotypes [5]. A significant benefit of animal experimentation is that test species can be chosen that have a much shorter life cycle than humans. Therefore, animal models can be studied throughout their life span and for several successive generations, an essential element for the understanding of disease progression along with its interaction with the whole organism throughout its lifetime [6].
Animal models often play a critical role in helping researchers who are exploring the efficacy and safety of potential medical treatments and drugs. They help to identify any dangerous or undesired side effects, such as birth defects, infertility, toxicity, liver damage or any potential carcinogenic effects [7]. Currently, U.S. Federal law, for example, requires that non-human animal research is used to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of any new treatment options before proceeding to trials on humans [8]. Of course, it is not only humans benefit from this research and testing, since many of the drugs and treatments that are developed for humans are routinely used in veterinary clinics, which help animals live longer and healthier lives [4].
COVID-19 AND THE NEED FOR ANIMAL MODELS
When COVID-19 struck, there was a desperate need for research on the disease, its effects on the brain and body and on the development of new treatments for patients with the disease. Early in the disease it was noticed that those with the disease suffered a loss of smell and taste, as well as neurological and psychiatric symptoms, some of which lasted long after the patients had “survived” the disease [9-15]. As soon as the pandemic started, there was a search for appropriate animal models in which to study this unknown disease [16, 17]. While genetically modified mice and rats are the basic animal models for neurological and immunological research [18, 19] the need to understand COVID-19 led to a range of animal models; from fruit flies [20] and Zebrafish [21] to large mammals [22, 23] and primates [24, 25]. And it was just not one animal model that was needed, but many, because different aspects of the disease are best studied in different animal models [16, 25, 26]. There is also a need to study the transmission pathways of the zoonosis: where does it come from, what are the animal hosts and how is it transferred to humans [27]?
There has been a need for animal models for understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 [28], for studying the mechanisms of transmission of the disease [16], for studying its neurobiology [29,30] and for developing new vaccines [31]. The sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fact that animal research is necessary, and that the curtailment of such research has serious consequences for the health of both humans and animals, both wild and domestic [32] As highlighted by Adhikary et al. [22] and Genzel et al. [33] the coronavirus has made clear the necessity for animal research and the danger in surviving future such pandemics if animal research is not fully supported. Genzel et al. [33], in particular, take issue with the proposal for a European ban on animal testing. Finally, there is a danger in bypassing animal research in developing new vaccines for diseases such as COVID-19 [34]. The purpose of this paper is to show that, while animal research is necessary for the health of both humans and animals, there is a need to carry out such experimentation in a controlled and humane manner. The use of alternatives to animal research such as cultured human cells and computer modeling may be a useful adjunct to animal studies but will require that such methods are more readily accessible to researchers and are not a replacement for animal experimentation.Pros and cons of animal experimentation
ARGUMENTS AGAINST ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION
A fundamental question surrounding this debate is to ask whether it is appropriate to use animals for medical research. Is our acceptance that animals have a morally lower value or standard of life just a case of speciesism [35]? Nowadays, most people agree that animals have a moral status and that needlessly hurting or abusing pets or other animals is unacceptable. This represents something of a change from the historical point of view where animals did not have any moral status and the treatment of animals was mostly subservient to maintaining the health and dignity of humans [36].
Animal rights advocates strongly argue that the moral status of non-human animals is similar to that of humans, and that animals are entitled to equality of treatment. In this view, animals should be treated with the same level of respect as humans, and no one should have the right to force them into any service or to kill them or use them for their own goals. One aspect of this argument claims that moral status depends upon the capacity to suffer or enjoy life [37].
In terms of suffering and the capacity of enjoying life, many animals are not very different from human beings, as they can feel pain and experience pleasure [38]. Hence, they should be given the same moral status as humans and deserve equivalent treatment. Supporters of this argument point out that according animals a lower moral status than humans is a type of prejudice known as “speciesism” [38]. Among humans, it is widely accepted that being a part of a specific race or of a specific gender does not provide the right to ascribe a lower moral status to the outsiders. Many advocates of animal rights deploy the same argument, that being human does not give us sufficient grounds declare animals as being morally less significant [36].ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION
Those who support animal experimentation have frequently made the argument that animals cannot be elevated to be seen as morally equal to humans [39]. Their main argument is that the use of the terms “moral status” or “morality” is debatable. They emphasize that we must not make the error of defining a quality or capacity associated with an animal by using the same adjectives used for humans [39]. Since, for the most part, animals do not possess humans’ cognitive capabilities and lack full autonomy (animals do not appear to rationally pursue specific goals in life), it is argued that therefore, they cannot be included in the moral community [39]. It follows from this line of argument that, if animals do not possess the same rights as human beings, their use in research experimentation can be considered appropriate [40]. The European and the American legislation support this kind of approach as much as their welfare is respected.
Another aspect of this argument is that the benefits to human beings of animal experimentation compensate for the harm caused to animals by these experiments.
In other words, animal harm is morally insignificant compared to the potential benefits to humans. Essentially, supporters of animal experimentation claim that human beings have a higher moral status than animals and that animals lack certain fundamental rights accorded to humans. The potential violations of animal rights during animal research are, in this way, justified by the greater benefits to mankind [40, 41]. A way to evaluate when the experiments are morally justified was published in 1986 by Bateson, which developed the Bateson’s Cube [42]. The Cube has three axes: suffering, certainty of benefit and quality of research. If the research is high-quality, beneficial, and not inflicting suffering, it will be acceptable. At the contrary, painful, low-quality research with lower likelihood of success will not be acceptable [42, 43].Impact of experimentations on animals
ABILITY TO FEEL PAIN AND DISTRESS
Like humans, animal have certain physical as well as psychological characteristics that make their use for experimentation controversial [44].
In the last few decades, many studies have increased knowledge of animal awareness and sentience: they indicate that animals have greater potential to experience damage than previously appreciated and that current rights and protections need to be reconsidered [45]. In recent times, scientists as well as ethicists have broadly acknowledged that animals can also experience distress and pain [46]. Potential sources of such harm arising from their use in research include disease, basic physiological needs deprivation and invasive procedures [46]. Moreover, social deprivation and lack of the ability to carry out their natural behaviors are other causes of animal harm [46]. Several studies have shown that, even in response to very gentle handling and management, animals can show marked alterations in their physiological and hormonal stress markers [47].
In spite of the fact that suffering and pain are personalized experiences, several multi-disciplinary studies have provided clear evidence of animals experiencing pain and distress. In particular, some animal species have the ability to express pain similarly to human due to common psychological, neuroanatomical and genetic characteristics [48]. Similarly, animals share a resemblance to humans in their developmental, genetic and environmental risk factors for psychopathology. For instance, in many species, it has been shown that fear operates within a less organized subcortical neural circuit than pain [49, 50]. Various types of depression and anxiety disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder have also been reported in mammals [51].PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES OF ANIMALS
Some researchers have suggested that besides their ability to experience physical and psychological pain and distress, some animals also exhibit empathy, self-awareness and language-like capabilities. They also demonstrate tools-linked cognizance, pleasure-seeking and advanced problem-solving skills [52]. Moreover, mammals and birds exhibit playful behavior, an indicator of the capacity to experience pleasure. Other taxa such as reptiles, cephalopods and fishes have also been observed to display playful behavior, therefore the current legislation prescribes the use of environmental enrichers [53]. The presence of self-awareness ability, as assessed by mirror self-recognition, has been reported in magpies, chimpanzees and other apes, and certain cetaceans [54]. Recently, another study has revealed that crows have the ability to create and use tools that involve episodic-like memory formation and its retrieval. From these findings, it may be suggested that crows as well as related species show evidence of flexible learning strategies, causal reasoning, prospection and imagination that are similar to behavior observed in great apes [55]. In the context of resolving the ethical dilemmas about animal experimentation, these observations serve to highlight the challenges involved [56, 57].Ethics, principles and legislation in animal experimentation
ETHICS IN ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION
Legislation around animal research is based on the idea of the moral acceptability of the proposed experiments under specific conditions [58]. The significance of research ethics that ensures proper treatment of experimental animals [58]. To avoid undue suffering of animals, it is important to follow ethical considerations during animal studies [1]. It is important to provide best human care to these animals from the ethical and scientific point of view [1]. Poor animal care can lead to experimental outcomes [1]. Thus, if experimental animals mistreated, the scientific knowledge and conclusions obtained from experiments may be compromised and may be difficult to replicate, a hallmark of scientific research [1]. At present, most ethical guidelines work on the assumption that animal experimentation is justified because of the significant potential benefits to human beings. These guidelines are often permissive of animal experimentation regardless of the damage to the animal as long as human benefits are achieved [59].PRINCIPLE OF THE 4 RS
Although animal experimentation has resulted in many discoveries and helped in the understanding numerous aspects of biological science, its use in various sectors is strictly controlled. In practice, the proposed set of animal experiments is usually considered by a multidisciplinary Ethics Committee before work can commence [60]. This committee will review the research protocol and make a judgment as to its sustainability. National and international laws govern the utilization of animal experimentation during research and these laws are mostly based on the universal doctrine presented by Russell and Burch (1959) known as principle of the 3 Rs. The 3Rs referred to are Reduction, Refinement and Replacement, and are applied to protocols surrounding the use of animals in research. Some researchers have proposed another “R”, of responsibility for the experimental animal as well as for the social and scientific status of the animal experiments [61]. Thus, animal ethics committees commonly review research projects with reference to the 4 Rs principles [62].
The first “R”, Reduction means that the experimental design is examined to ensure that researchers have reduced the number of experimental animals in a research project to the minimum required for reliable data [59]. Methods used for this purpose include improved experimental design, extensive literature search to avoid duplication of experiments [35], use of advanced imaging techniques, sharing resources and data, and appropriate statistical data analysis that reduce the number of animals needed for statistically significant results [2, 63].
The second “R”, Refinement involves improvements in procedure that minimize the harmful effects of the proposed experiments on the animals involved, such as reducing pain, distress and suffering in a manner that leads to a general improvement in animal welfare. This might include for example improved living conditions for research animals, proper training of people handling animals, application of anesthesia and analgesia when required and the need for euthanasia of the animals at the end of the experiment to curtail their suffering [63].
The third “R”, Replacement refers to approaches that replace or avoid the use of experimental animals altogether. These approaches involve use of in silico methods/computerized techniques/software and in vitro methods like cell and tissue culture testing, as well as relative replacement methods by use of invertebrates like nematode worms, fruit flies and microorganisms in place of vertebrates and higher animals [1]. Examples of proper application of these first “3R2 principles are the use of alternative sources of blood, the exploitation of commercially used animals for scientific research, a proper training without use of animals and the use of specimen from previous experiments for further researches [64-67].
The fourth “R”, Responsibility refers to concerns around promoting animal welfare by improvements in experimental animals’ social life, development of advanced scientific methods for objectively determining sentience, consciousness, experience of pain and intelligence in the animal kingdom, as well as effective involvement in the professionalization of the public discussion on animal ethics [68].OTHER ASPECTS OF ANIMAL RESEARCH ETHICS
Other research ethics considerations include having a clear rationale and reasoning for the use of animals in a research project. Researchers must have reasonable expectation of generating useful data from the proposed experiment. Moreover, the research study should be designed in such a way that it should involve the lowest possible sample size of experimental animals while producing statistically significant results [35].
All individual researchers that handle experimental animals should be properly trained for handling the particular species involved in the research study. The animal’s pain, suffering and discomfort should be minimized [69]. Animals should be given proper anesthesia when required and surgical procedures should not be repeated on same animal whenever possible [69]. The procedure of humane handling and care of experimental animals should be explicitly detailed in the research study protocol. Moreover, whenever required, aseptic techniques should be properly followed [70]. During the research, anesthetization and surgical procedures on experimental animals should only be performed by professionally skilled individuals [69].
The Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines that are issued by the National Center for the Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) are designed to improve the documentation surrounding research involving experimental animals [70]. The checklist provided includes the information required in the various sections of the manuscript i.e. study design, ethical statements, experimental procedures, experimental animals and their housing and husbandry, and more [70].
It is critical to follow the highest ethical standards while performing animal experiments. Indeed, most of the journals refuse to publish any research data that lack proper ethical considerations [35].INVESTIGATORS’ ETHICS
Since animals have sensitivity level similar to the human beings in terms of pain, anguish, survival instinct and memory, it is the responsibility of the investigator to closely monitor the animals that are used and identify any sign of distress [71]. No justification can rationalize the absence of anesthesia or analgesia in animals that undergo invasive surgery during the research [72]. Investigators are also responsible for giving high-quality care to the experimental animals, including the supply of a nutritious diet, easy water access, prevention of and relief from any pain, disease and injury, and appropriate housing facilities for the animal species [73]. A research experiment is not permitted if the damage caused to the animal exceeds the value of knowledge gained by that experiment. No scientific advancement based on the destruction and sufferings of another living being could be justified. Besides ensuring the welfare of animals involved, investigators must also follow the applicable legislation [74, 75].
To promote the comfort of experimental animals in England, an animal protection society named: ‘The Society for the Preservation of Cruelty to Animals’ (now the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) was established (1824) that aims to prevent cruelty to animal [76].ANIMAL WELFARE LAWS
Legislation for animal protection during research has long been established. In 1876 the British Parliament sanctioned the ‘Cruelty to Animals Act’ for animal protection. Russell and Burch (1959) presented the ‘3 Rs’ principles: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement, for use of animals during research [61]. Almost seven years later, the U.S.A also adopted regulations for the protection of experimental animals by enacting the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 [60]. In Brazil, the Arouca Law (Law No. 11,794/08) regulates the animal use in scientific research experiments [76].
These laws define the breeding conditions, and regulate the use of animals for scientific research and teaching purposes. Such legal provisions control the use of anesthesia, analgesia or sedation in experiments that could cause distress or pain to experimental animals [59, 76]. These laws also stress the need for euthanasia when an experiment is finished, or even during the experiment if there is any intense suffering for the experimental animal [76].
Several national and international organizations have been established to develop alternative techniques so that animal experimentation can be avoided, such as the UK-based National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) (www.caat.jhsph.edu), the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) [77], the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) (www.ufaw.org.uk), The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) [78], and The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) (www.caat.jhsph.edu). The Brazilian ‘Arouca Law’ also constitutes a milestone, as it has created the ‘National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation’ (CONCEA) that deals with the legal and ethical issues related to the use of experimental animals during scientific research [76].
Although national as well as international laws and guidelines have provided basic protections for experimental animals, the current regulations have some significant discrepancies. In the U.S., the Animal Welfare Act excludes rats, mice and purpose-bred birds, even though these species comprise almost 90% of the animals that are used for research purpose [79]. On the other hand, certain cats and dogs are getting special attention along with extra protection. While the U.S. Animal Welfare Act ignores birds, mice and rats, the U.S. guidelines that control research performed using federal funding ensure protections for all vertebrates [79, 80].Living conditions of animals
CHOICE OF THE ANIMAL MODEL
Based on all the above laws and regulations and in line with the deliberations of ethical committees, every researcher must follow certain rules when dealing with animal models.
Before starting any experimental work, thorough research should be carried out during the study design phase so that the unnecessary use of experimental animals is avoided. Nevertheless, certain research studies may have compelling reasons for the use of animal models, such as the investigation of human diseases and toxicity tests. Moreover, animals are also widely used in the training of health professionals as well as in training doctors in surgical skills [1, 81].
Researcher should be well aware of the specific traits of the animal species they intend to use in the experiment, such as its developmental stages, physiology, nutritional needs, reproductive characteristics and specific behaviors. Animal models should be selected on the basis of the study design and the biological relevance of the animal [1].
Typically, in early research, non-mammalian models are used to get rapid insights into research problems such as the identification of gene function or the recognition of novel therapeutic options. Thus, in biomedical and biological research, among the most commonly used model organisms are the Zebrafish, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The main advantage of these non-mammalian animal models is their prolific reproducibility along with their much shorter generation time. They can be easily grown in any laboratory setting, are less expensive than the murine animal models and are somewhat more powerful than the tissue and cell culture approaches [82].
Caenorhabditis elegans is a small-sized nematode with a short life cycle and that exists in large populations and is relatively inexpensive to cultivate. Scientists have gathered extensive knowledge of the genomics and genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans; but Caenorhabditis elegans models, while very useful in some respects, are unable to represent all signaling pathways found in humans. Furthermore, due to its short life cycle, scientists are unable to investigate long term effects of test compounds or to analyze primary versus secondary effects [6].
Similarly, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has played a key role in numerous biomedical discoveries. It is small in size, has a short life cycle and large population size, is relatively inexpensive to breed, and extensive genomics and genetics information is available [6]. However, its respiratory, cardiovascular and nervous systems differ considerably from human beings. In addition, its immune system is less developed when compared to vertebrates, which is why effectiveness of a drug in Drosophila melanogaster may not be easily extrapolated to humans [83].
The Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a small freshwater teleost, with transparent embryos, providing easy access for the observation of organogenesis and its manipulation. Therefore, Zebrafish embryos are considered good animal models for different human diseases like tuberculosis and fetal alcohol syndrome and are useful as neurodevelopmental research models. However, Zebrafish has very few mutant strains available, and its genome has numerous duplicate genes making it impossible to create knockout strains, since disrupting one copy of the gene will not disrupt the second copy of that gene. This feature limits the use of Zebrafish as animal models to study human diseases. Additionally they are rather expensive, have long life cycle, and genomics and genetics studies are still in progress [82, 84].
Thus, experimentation on these three animals might not be equivalent to experimentation on mammals. Mammalian animal model are most similar to human beings, so targeted gene replacement is possible. Traditionally, mammals like monkey and mice have been the preferred animal models for biomedical research because of their evolutionary closeness to humans. Rodents, particularly mice and rats, are the most frequently used animal models for scientific research. Rats are the most suitable animal model for the study of obesity, shock, peritonitis, sepsis, cancer, intestinal operations, spleen, gastric ulcers, mononuclear phagocytic system, organ transplantations and wound healing. Mice are more suitable for studying burns, megacolon, shock, cancer, obesity, and sepsis as mentioned previously [85].
Similarly, pigs are mostly used for stomach, liver and transplantation studies, while rabbits are suitable for the study of immunology, inflammation, vascular biology, shock, colitis and transplantations. Thus, the choice of experimental animal mainly depends upon the field of scientific research under consideration [1].HOUSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT
Researchers should be aware of the environment and conditions in which laboratory animals are kept during research, and they also need to be familiar with the metabolism of the animals kept in vivarium, since their metabolism can easily be altered by different factors such as pain, stress, confinement, lack of sunlight, etc. Housing conditions alter animal behavior, and this can in turn affect experimental results. By contrast, handling procedures that feature environmental enrichment and enhancement help to decrease stress and positively affect the welfare of the animals and the reliability of research data [74, 75].
In animals, distress- and agony-causing factors should be controlled or eliminated to overcome any interference with data collection as well as with interpretation of the results, since impaired animal welfare leads to more animal usage during experiment, decreased reliability and increased discrepancies in results along with the unnecessary consumption of animal lives [86].
To reduce the variation or discrepancies in experimental data caused by various environmental factors, experimental animals must be kept in an appropriate and safe place. In addition, it is necessary to keep all variables like humidity, airflow and temperature at levels suitable for those species, as any abrupt variation in these factors could cause stress, reduced resistance and increased susceptibility to infections [74].
The space allotted to experimental animals should permit them free movement, proper sleep and where feasible allow for interaction with other animals of the same species. Mice and rats are quite sociable animals and must, therefore, be housed in groups for the expression of their normal behavior. Usually, laboratory cages are not appropriate for the behavioral needs of the animals. Therefore, environmental enrichment is an important feature for the expression of their natural behavior that will subsequently affect their defense mechanisms and physiology [87].
The features of environmental enrichment must satisfy the animals’ sense of curiosity, offer them fun activities, and also permit them to fulfill their behavioral and physiological needs. These needs include exploring, hiding, building nests and gnawing. For this purpose, different things can be used in their environment, such as PVC tubes, cardboard, igloos, paper towel, cotton, disposable masks and paper strips [87].
The environment used for housing of animals must be continuously controlled by appropriate disinfection, hygiene protocols, sterilization and sanitation processes. These steps lead to a reduction in the occurrence of various infectious agents that often found in vivarium, such as Sendai virus, cestoda and Mycoplasma pulmonis [88].EUTHANASIA
Euthanasia is a term derived from Greek, and it means a death without any suffering. According to the Brazilian Arouca Law (Article 14, Chapter IV, Paragraphs 1 and 2), an animal should undergo euthanasia, in strict compliance with the requirements of each species, when the experiment ends or during any phase of the experiment, wherever this procedure is recommended and/or whenever serious suffering occurs. If the animal does not undergo euthanasia after the intervention it may leave the vivarium and be assigned to suitable people or to the animal protection bodies, duly legalized [1].
Euthanasia procedures must result in instant loss of consciousness which leads to respiratory or cardiac arrest as well as to complete brain function impairment. Another important aspect of this procedure is calm handling of the animal while taking it out of its enclosure, to reduce its distress, suffering, anxiety and fear. In every research project, the study design should include the details of the appropriate endpoints of these experimental animals, and also the methods that will be adopted. It is important to determine the appropriate method of euthanasia for the animal being used. Another important point is that, after completing the euthanasia procedure, the animal’s death should be absolutely confirmed before discarding their bodies [87, 89].Relevance of animal experimentations and possible alternatives
RELEVANCE OF ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS AND THEIR ADVERSE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH
One important concern is whether human diseases, when inflicted on experimental animals, adequately mimic the progressions of the disease and the treatment responses observed in humans. Several research articles have made comparisons between human and animal data, and indicated that the results of animals’ research could not always be reliably replicated in clinical research among humans. The latest systematic reviews about the treatment of different clinical conditions including neurology, vascular diseases and others, have established that the results of animal studies cannot properly predict human outcomes [59, 90].
At present, the reliability of animal experiments for extrapolation to human health is questionable. Harmful effects may occur in humans because of misleading results from research conducted on animals. For instance, during the late fifties, a sedative drug, thalidomide, was prescribed for pregnant women, but some of the women using that drug gave birth to babies lacking limbs or with foreshortened limbs, a condition called phocomelia. When thalidomide had been tested on almost all animal models such as rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, cats, hamsters, armadillos, ferrets, swine, guinea pig, etc., this teratogenic effect was observed only occasionally [91]. Similarly, in 2006, the compound TGN 1412 was designed as an immunomodulatory drug, but when it was injected into six human volunteer, serious adverse reactions were observed resulting from a deadly cytokine storm that in turn led to disastrous systemic organ failure. TGN 1412 had been tested successfully in rats, mice, rabbits, and non-human primates [92]. Moreover, Bailey (2008) reported 90 HIV vaccines that had successful trial results in animals but which failed in human beings [93]. Moreover, in Parkinson disease, many therapeutic options that have shown promising results in rats and non-human primate models have proved harmful in humans. Hence, to analyze the relevance of animal research to human health, the efficacy of animal experimentation should be examined systematically [94, 95]. At the same time, the development of hyperoxaluria and renal failure (up to dialysis) after ileal-jejunal bypass was unexpected because this procedure was not preliminarily evaluated on an animal model [96].
Several factors play a role in the extrapolation of animal-derived data to humans, such as environmental conditions and physiological parameters related to stress, age of the experimental animals, etc. These factors could switch on or off genes in the animal models that are specific to species and/or strains. All these observations challenge the reliability and suitability of animal experimentation as well as its objectives with respect to human health [76, 92].ALTERNATIVE TO ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION/DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNIQUES TO AVOID ANIMAL SACRIFICE IN RESEARCH
Certainly, in vivo animal experimentation has significantly contributed to the development of biological and biomedical research. However it has the limitations of strict ethical issues and high production cost. Some scientists consider animal testing an ineffective and immoral practice and therefore prefer alternative techniques to be used instead of animal experimentation. These alternative methods involve in vitro experiments and ex vivo models like cell and tissue cultures, use of plants and vegetables, non-invasive human clinical studies, use of corpses for studies, use of microorganisms or other simpler organism like shrimps and water flea larvae, physicochemical techniques, educational software, computer simulations, mathematical models and nanotechnology [97]. These methods and techniques are cost-effective and could efficiently replace animal models. They could therefore, contribute to animal welfare and to the development of new therapies that can identify the therapeutics and related complications at an early stage [1].
The National Research Council (UK) suggested a shift from the animal models toward computational models, as well as high-content and high-throughput in vitro methods. Their reports highlighted that these alternative methods could produce predictive data more affordably, accurately and quickly than the traditional in vivo or experimental animal methods [98].
Increasingly, scientists and the review boards have to assess whether addressing a research question using the applied techniques of advanced genetics, molecular, computational and cell biology, and biochemistry could be used to replace animal experiments [59]. It must be remembered that each alternative method must be first validated and then registered in dedicated databases.
An additional relevant concern is how precisely animal data can mirror relevant epigenetic changes and human genetic variability. Langley and his colleagues have highlighted some of the examples of existing and some emerging non-animal based research methods in the advanced fields of neurology, orthodontics, infectious diseases, immunology, endocrine, pulmonology, obstetrics, metabolism and cardiology [99].IN SILICO SIMULATIONS AND INFORMATICS
Several computer models have been built to study cardiovascular risk and atherosclerotic plaque build-up, to model human metabolism, to evaluate drug toxicity and to address other questions that were previously approached by testing in animals [100].
Computer simulations can potentially decrease the number of experiments required for a research project, however simulations cannot completely replace laboratory experiments. Unfortunately, not all the principles regulating biological systems are known, and computer simulation provide only an estimation of possible effects due to the limitations of computer models in comparison with complex human tissues. However, simulation and bio-informatics are now considered essential in all fields of science for their efficiency in using the existing knowledge for further experimental designs [76].
At present, biological macromolecules are regularly simulated at various levels of detail, to predict their response and behavior under certain physical conditions, chemical exposures and stimulations. Computational and bioinformatic simulations have significantly reduced the number of animals sacrificed during drug discovery by short listing potential candidate molecules for a drug. Likewise, computer simulations have decreased the number of animal experiments required in other areas of biological science by efficiently using the existing knowledge. Moreover, the development of high definition 3D computer models for anatomy with enhanced level of detail, it may make it possible to reduce or eliminate the need for animal dissection during teaching [101, 102].3D CELL-CULTURE MODELS AND ORGANS-ON-CHIPS
In the current scenario of rapid advancement in the life sciences, certain tissue models can be built using 3D cell culture technology. Indeed, there are some organs on micro-scale chip models used for mimicking the human body environment. 3D models of multiple organ systems such as heart, liver, skin, muscle, testis, brain, gut, bone marrow, lungs and kidney, in addition to individual organs, have been created in microfluidic channels, re-creating the physiological chemical and physical microenvironments of the body [103]. These emerging techniques, such as the biomedical/biological microelectromechanical system (Bio-MEMS) or lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro total analysis systems (lTAS) will, in the future, be a useful substitute for animal experimentation in commercial laboratories in the biotechnology, environmental safety, chemistry and pharmaceutical industries. For 3D cell culture modeling, cells are grown in 3D spheroids or aggregates with the help of a scaffold or matrix, or sometimes using a scaffold-free method. The 3D cell culture modeling conditions can be altered to add proteins and other factors that are found in a tumor microenvironment, for example, or in particular tissues. These matrices contain extracellular matrix components such as proteins, glycoconjugates and glycosaminoglycans that allow for cell communication, cell to cell contact and the activation of signaling pathways in such a way that the morphological and functional differentiation of these cells can accurately mimic their environment in vivo. This methodology, in time, will bridge the gap between in vivo and in vitro drug screening, decreasing the utilization of animal models during research [104].ALTERNATIVES TO MICROBIAL CULTURE MEDIA AND SERUM-FREE ANIMAL CELL CULTURES
There are moves to reduce the use of animal derived products in many areas of biotechnology. Microbial culture media peptones are mostly made by the proteolysis of farmed animal meat. However, nowadays, various suppliers provide peptones extracted from yeast and plants. Although the costs of these plant-extracted peptones are the same as those of animal peptones, plant peptones are more environmentally favorable since less plant material and water are required for them to grow, compared with the food grain and fodder needed for cattle that are slaughtered for animal peptone production [105].
Human cell culture is often carried out in a medium that contains fetal calf serum, the production of which involves animal (cow) sacrifice or suffering. In fact, living pregnant cows are used and their fetuses removed to harvest the serum from the fetal blood. Fetal calf serum is used because it is a natural medium rich in all the required nutrients and significantly increases the chances of successful cell growth in culture. Scientists are striving to identify the factors and nutrients required for the growth of various types of cells, with a view to eliminating the use of calf serum. At present, most cell lines could be cultured in a chemically-synthesized medium without using animal products. Furthermore, data from chemically-synthesized media experiments may have better reproducibility than those using animal serum media, since the composition of animal serum does change from batch to batch on the basis of animals’ gender, age, health and genetic background [76].ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL-DERIVED ANTIBODIES
Animal friendly affinity reagents may act as an alternative to antibodies produced, thereby removing the need for animal immunization. Typically, these antibodies are obtained in vitro by yeast, phage or ribosome display. In a recent review, a comparative analysis between animal friendly affinity reagents and animal derived-antibodies showed that the affinity reagents have superior quality, are relatively less time consuming, have more reproducibility and are more reliable and are cost-effective [106, 107].Conclusions
Animal experimentation led to great advancement in biological and biomedical sciences and contributed to the discovery of many drugs and treatment options. However, such experimentation may cause harm, pain and distress to the animals involved. Therefore, to perform animal experimentations, certain ethical rules and laws must be strictly followed and there should be proper justification for using animals in research projects. Furthermore, during animal experimentation the 4 Rs principles of reduction, refinement, replacement and responsibility must be followed by the researchers. Moreover, before beginning a research project, experiments should be thoroughly planned and well-designed, and should avoid unnecessary use of animals. The reliability and reproducibility of animal experiments should also be considered. Whenever possible, alternative methods to animal experimentation should be adopted, such as in vitro experimentation, cadaveric studies, and computer simulations.
While much progress has been made on reducing animal experimentation there is a need for greater awareness of alternatives to animal experiments among scientists and easier access to advanced modeling technologies. Greater research is needed to define a roadmap that will lead to the elimination of all unnecessary animal experimentation and provide a framework for adoption of reliable alternative methodologies in biomedical research.Acknowledgements

What is the Donoghue v. Stevenson case?,"Donoghue v. Stevenson is a landmark case in the law of torts in England and Wales. It concerns the liability of manufacturers for personal injuries caused by a product that is defective or dangerous.

The case arose from a horse rider's injury sustained while riding a horse owned by the defendant. The rider had been given a bottle of ginger beer containing a substance known as ""brumbrum"" which the defendant had admitted to containing a poisonous substance. The rider was injured and sued the defendant for damages.

The court found that the defendant was liable for the rider's injuries because it had been negligent in supplying the rider with the product, even though the rider had assumed the risk of injury. The court held that the defendant had a duty of care to the rider, and that the defendant had breached that duty by supplying the rider with a product that contained a dangerous substance.

The case established the principle that manufacturers and suppliers of products have a duty of care to consumers and must take reasonable steps to ensure that their products are safe. The case has since been used as a precedent in many other cases in the law of torts.

In summary, Donoghue v. Stevenson is a case that established the principle of manufacturer's liability for personal injuries caused by dangerous or defective products. It is a landmark case in the law of torts and has been used as a precedent in many other cases.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donoghue_v_Stevenson,"

Tort

Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562 was a landmark court decision in Scots delict law and English tort law by the House of Lords. It laid the foundation of the modern law of negligence in common law jurisdictions worldwide, as well as in Scotland, establishing general principles of the duty of care.[5]
Also known as the ""Paisley Snail"" or ""Snail in the Bottle"" case, the case involved Mrs May Donoghue drinking a bottle of ginger beer in a café in Paisley, Renfrewshire. Unknown to her or anybody else, a decomposed snail was in the bottle. She fell ill, and subsequently sued the ginger beer manufacturer, Mr Stevenson. The House of Lords held that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to her, which was breached because it was reasonably foreseeable that failure to ensure the product's safety would lead to harm to consumers. There was also a sufficiently proximate relationship between consumers and product manufacturers.[5]
Prior to Donoghue v Stevenson, liability for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly (trespass to the person) or indirectly (trespass on the case). Being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either, so the orthodox view was that Mrs Donoghue had no sustainable claim in law. However, the decision fundamentally created a new type of liability in law that did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims. This was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict, moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a fault-based system that only required injury.[5] This evolution was taken further in the later decision of Letang v Cooper [1965] 1 QB 232 when it was held that actions should not be jointly pleaded in trespass and negligence, but in negligence alone.[citation needed]


Background and facts[edit]
Gilmour Street station where Donoghue arrived in Paisley
On the evening of Sunday 26 August 1928, during the Glasgow Trades Holiday, May Donoghue took a train to Paisley, Renfrewshire.[3][6]: 1 [6]: 2  In Paisley, she went to the Wellmeadow Café. A friend,[Note 2] who was with her, ordered a pear and ice for herself. Donoghue asked for a Scotsman ice cream float, a mix of ice cream and ginger beer.[6]: 4  The owner of the café, Francis Minghella,[Note 3] brought over a tumbler of ice cream and poured ginger beer on it from a brown and opaque bottle labelled ""D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley"". Although the bottle was labelled as Stevenson's, McByde[who?] suggests it is possible it did not originally belong to him (Stevenson). Bottles were often reused, and in the process occasionally returned to the incorrect manufacturer. Moreover, Stevenson initially claimed he did not issue bottles matching the description provided by Donoghue.[3][6]: 9–10 
Donoghue drank some of the ice cream float. When her friend poured the remaining ginger beer into the tumbler, a decomposed snail also floated out of the bottle. Donoghue claimed that she felt ill from this sight, complaining of abdominal pain.[3][8] According to her later statements of facts, she was required to consult a doctor on 29 August and was admitted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for ""emergency treatment"" on 16 September.[6]: 23 [9]: 7  She was subsequently diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock.[3][7]: 566 
The ginger beer had been manufactured by David Stevenson, who ran a company producing both ginger beer and lemonade at 11 and 12 Glen Lane, Paisley, less than a mile away from the Wellmeadow Café.[6]: 6–7  The contact details for the ginger beer manufacturer were on the bottle label and recorded by Donoghue's friend.[6]: 11 
Donoghue subsequently contacted and instructed Walter Leechman, a local solicitor and city councillor whose firm had acted for the claimants in a factually similar case, Mullen v AG Barr & Co Ltd,[10] less than three weeks earlier[3] (see also George v Skivington).
Despite the ruling in Mullen, Leechman issued a writ on Donoghue's behalf against Stevenson on 9 April 1929.[3][11]: 31  The writ claimed £500 in damages, the same amount a claimant in Mullen had recovered at first instance, and £50 in costs.[6]: 22 [9]: 4  The total amount Donoghue attempted to recover would be approximately equivalent to £42,234 in 2023.[6]: 22 [12]

Condescendences[edit]
The full allegations made by Donoghue were presented in five condescendences, which claimed that Stevenson had a duty of care to Donoghue to ensure that snails did not get into his bottles of ginger beer, but that he had breached this duty by failing to provide a system to clean bottles effectively, a system that would usually be used in the business and was necessary given that the ginger beer was intended for human consumption.[6]: 22–23  The ineffectiveness of the cleaning system was alleged to result from the bottles being left in places ""to which it was obvious that snails had freedom of access ... and in which, indeed, snails and snail trails were frequently found"",[9]: 6  an allegation described by lawyer and author Matthew Chapman as ""somewhat gratuitous"".[6]: 7  This breach of duty was alleged to have caused Donoghue's subsequent illness.[9]: 7 
Stevenson responded to the condescendences by denying that any of his bottles of ginger beer had contained snails and ""that the alleged injuries are grossly exaggerated ... any illness suffered by the [claimant] was due to the bad condition of her own health at the time"".[9]: 6–7  In response to the writ, Stevenson pleaded four main arguments:

that the claim had no legal basis;
that the facts could not be substantiated;
that he had not caused Donoghue any injury;
that the claimed amount was excessive.[6]: 22–23 [9]: 8 
Legal background[edit]
Injuries resulting from defective products were normally claimed on the basis of a contract of sale between the seller and the consumer.[3] However, Donoghue had no contractual relationship with Minghella as she had not purchased the ginger beer; while her friend did have a contract through having placed the order, she had not suffered any injury.[5] Moreover, neither had a contract with Stevenson, the manufacturer.[8] Donoghue was therefore required to claim damages for negligence.[3]
Ansell v Waterhouse[13] had established in 1817 that legal liability could arise for an act or omission ""contrary to the duty which the law casts on him in the particular case"" (i.e. negligence).[14]: 105–106  However, there was no general duty of care and therefore no general liability for negligent behaviour. Only limited exceptions to this rule were made in which duties were found in specific circumstances, most of which had a contractual background.[4]: 643 [14]: 109 [15]: 86 
The most difficult precedent for Donoghue was Mullen v AG Barr & Co Ltd, a recent (1929) Court of Session case. In Mullen, two children, John and Francis Mullen, and Jeanie Oribine had separately found dead mice in their bottles of ginger beer, manufactured by AG Barr & Co Ltd, and claimed to have become ill through drinking the tainted liquid. In separate hearings in Glasgow and Greenock Sheriff Court respectively, Orbine was successful in claiming compensation while the Mullens were not. The losing parties of both cases appealed to the Court of Session.[6]: 16–17 
At the Court of Session, the claimants argued that although there was no direct evidence that the manufacturer had been negligent in preparing the ginger beer, negligence could be presumed (res ipsa loquitur) from the mere presence of dead mice in ginger beer bottles. However, the court ruled against the claimants.[6]: 16–17  The majority held that on a factual basis AG Barr & Co Ltd had rebutted a presumption of negligence and that on a legal basis product manufacturers only owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumers if there was a contractual relationship between the parties; if the dangerousness of the product was intentionally withheld from the consumer (in which case there might also be a claim for fraud); or if there was no warning of the intrinsic dangerousness of certain products, such as explosives.[3][6]: 17–18 
Only Lord Hunter dissented, finding that negligence to be inferred and that the fact that the bottle contents could not be examined (because of the dark glass) gave rise to a specific duty of care that would allow consumers to claim for damages.[6]: 18–19 
However, neither of the circumstances in which negligence could be found in product liability cases applied to Donoghue: ginger beer is not intrinsically dangerous, nor did Stevenson intentionally misrepresent the threat it posed. Nevertheless, Donoghue's counsel argued that manufacturers also owed a duty of care to their ultimate consumers if it was not possible to examine the goods before they were used, an exception that would apply to Donoghue.[8]

Judgment[edit]
Court of Session, Outer House[edit]
Parliament House in Edinburgh, where the Court of Session sits
The first interlocutory action was heard on the Court of Session on 21 May 1929 in front of Lord Moncrieff. After an adjournment, Minghella was added as a defender on 5 June; however, the claim against him was abandoned on 19 November, likely due to his lack of contractual relationship with Donoghue (Donoghue's friend had purchased the ginger beer) and his inability to examine the contents of the dark glass bottle. On 12 December, Minghella and Stevenson were awarded a combined costs claim of £108 6s 3d against Donoghue for this abandoned strand of litigation. However, it was recorded on 20 December that Donoghue did not pay the costs awarded to Minghella.[6]: 23–25 
The case was heard by Lord Moncrieff in the Outer House on 27 June 1930. In his judgment, delivered on the same day, he held that, as a general principle, there should be liability for negligent preparation of food.[6]: 25–26 

I am unhesitatingly of opinion that those who deal with the production of food or produce fluids for beverage purposes ought not to be heard to plead ignorance of the active danger which will be associated with their products, as a consequence of any imperfect observation of cleanliness at any stage in the course of the process of manufacture ... Tainted food when offered for sale is, in my opinion, amongst the most subtly potent of 'dangerous goods', and to deal in or prepare such food is highly relevant to infer a duty. I fail to see why the fact that the danger has been introduced by an act of negligence and does not advertise itself, should release the negligent manufacturer from a duty, or afford him a supplementary defence.[16]: 4, 6 
English case law that required that liability for injuries resulting from goods that were not intrinsically dangerous to have a contractual basis (breach of warranty) was dismissed by Lord Moncrieff (citing John Salmond) for the narrowness of the approach and because there was no decision that incorporated it into Scots law.[6]: 26–27 [16]: 15–16  Finally, Mullen, despite its factual similarity, was discounted by a ""very close reading of the precedent opinions"".[6]: 27–29 [16]: 17–19 

Court of Session, Inner House[edit]
Stevenson appealed the case to the Inner House, where it was heard by the same four judges who had found against Mullen: Lord Alness (the Lord Justice-Clerk), Lord Ormidale, Lord Hunter and Lord Anderson.[6]: 29  In their judgment, given on 13 November 1930,[16]: 21  they all referred back to and supported their statements in Mullen, Lord Alness observing that ""the only difference – and, so far as I can see, it is not a material difference – between that case [Mullen] and this case [Donoghue] is that there we were dealing with a mouse in a ginger-beer bottle, and here we are dealing with a snail in a ginger-beer bottle"".[16]: 22  Thus, Lord Alness, Lord Ormidale and Lord Anderson all allowed the appeal while Lord Hunter dissented.[6]: 29–30 

House of Lords[edit]
Donoghue filed a petition to appeal to the House of Lords on 25 February 1931.[6]: 32  She also sought (and subsequently received) permission to pursue the case in forma pauperis (with the status of a pauper) – a status she had not, for unknown reasons, sought at the Court of Session[6]: 33–34  – providing an affidavit declaring that ""I am very poor, and am not worth in all the world the sum of five pounds, my wearing apparel and the subject matter of the said appeal only excepted"".[3] This claim was supported by the minister and two elders of her church and meant that Donoghue was not required to provide security for costs in case she lost the appeal.[6]: 34  (Her legal team had agreed to work pro bono.[3])

The Palace of Westminster, where five Lords of Appeal in Ordinary heard Donoghue's appeal
The petition was granted and the appeal was heard 10 and 11 December 1931 by Lord Buckmaster, Lord Atkin, Lord Tomlin, Lord Thankerton and Lord Macmillan. A supplementary statement from Donoghue's appeal papers indicates that her counsel, George Morton KC and William Milligan (later the Lord Advocate and a Privy Counsellor), argued that ""where anyone performs an operation, such as the manufacture of an article, a relationship of duty independent of contract may in certain circumstance arise, the extent of such duty in every case depending on the particular circumstances of the case"".[9]: 16  Stevenson, they argued, owed a duty to take reasonable care in the manufacture of his ginger beer because the sealed bottles were opaque, and therefore could not be examined, and because the ginger beer was intended for human consumption.[6]: 35–37 [9]: 16–17 
Stevenson's counsel, Wilfrid Normand KC (Solicitor General for Scotland and later a Law Lord) and James Clyde (later the Lord President of the Court of Session and a Privy Counsellor), responded that ""it is now firmly established both in English and Scottish law that in the ordinary case (which this is) the supplier or manufacturer of an article is under no duty to anyone with whom he is not in contractual relation"".[17]: 7  They denied that ginger beer was intrinsically dangerous or that Stevenson knew that the product was dangerous (the two established exceptions for finding a duty of care)[17]: 7–8  and argued that the third exception that Donoghue was attempting to introduce had no basis in precedent.[6]: 37–38 [17]: 8–11 
The House of Lords gave judgment on 26 May 1932 after an unusually long delay of over five months since the hearing.[Note 4][18]: 236–237  The court held by a majority of 3–2 that Donoghue's case disclosed a cause of action.[7]: 562  The majority consisted of Lord Atkin, Lord Thankerton and Lord Macmillan.[7]: 562 
Lord Atkin commented that he did ""not think a more important problem has occupied your Lordships in your judicial capacity, important both because of its bearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system under which it arises"".[11]: 43  He agreed with counsel, based on his own research, that Scots and English law were identical in requiring a duty of care for negligence to be found and explained his general neighbour principle on when that duty of care arises.[6]: 40–41 

At present I content myself with pointing out that in English law there must be, and is, some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care, of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances. The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of ""culpa"", is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot, in a practical world, be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.[11]: 44 
He supported this broad test by citing Heaven v Pender[19] and rejected the cases in favour of a narrower interpretation of a duty of care with the example of negligently poisoned food, for which there had been no claim against the manufacturer. ""If this were the result of the authorities, I should consider the result a grave defect in the law, and so contrary to principle that I should hesitate long before following any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this House"".[6]: 41 [11]: 44–46  He went on to suggest that there should be a duty of care owed by all manufacturers of ""articles of common household use"", listing medicine, soap and cleaning products as examples. ""I do not think so ill of our jurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civilised society and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there is so obviously a social wrong.""[6]: 42 [11]: 46 
Lord Atkin then rejected cases that did not support his approach and cited Benjamin N. Cardozo in the New York case MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.[20] in favour of his view.[6]: 42 [11]: 46–56 
He concluded:

If your Lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action, you will be affirming the proposition that by Scots and English law alike a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him, with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.
It is a proposition which I venture to say no one in Scotland or England who was not a lawyer would for one moment doubt. It will be an advantage to make it clear that the law in this matter, as in most others, is in accordance with sound common sense. I think that this appeal should be allowed.[11]: 57 
Lord Thankerton ruled that Donoghue had no contract with Stevenson, nor that her case was covered by one of the scenarios in which a duty of care had previously been found. However, he held that where goods could not be examined or interfered with, the manufacturer had ""of his own accord, brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer, with the result that the consumer [was] entitled to rely upon the exercise of diligence by the manufacturer to secure that the article shall not be harmful to the consumer"", an exception to the general nonexistence of a duty of care that applied to Donoghue.[6]: 51 [11]: 59–60 
Lord Thankerton further argued that it was impossible ""to catalogue finally, amid the ever-varying types of human relationships, those relationships in which a duty to exercise care arises apart from contract"" and commented that he ""should be sorry to think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by the [seller] should relieve the [seller] of any responsibility to the consumer without any corresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer"".[6]: 51–52 [11]: 60 
Lord Macmillan examined previous cases[11]: 65–70  and held that ""the law takes no cognisance of carelessness in the abstract. It concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage"".[6]: 46–47 [11]: 70  Whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the reasonable person. These circumstances ""must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed"".[6]: 47 [11]: 70 
Lord Macmillan held that, according to this standard, Stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them; that he owed Donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink; and that Donoghue's injury was reasonably foreseeable. He therefore found that Donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was ""happy to think that in ... relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents ... the principles of [English and Scots law] are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish.""[6]: 47–48 [11]: 71–72 
The minority consisted of Lord Buckmaster and Lord Tomlin.[7]: 562  Lord Buckmaster focused on precedent, and commenced by warning that ""although [common law] principles are capable of application to meet new conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down, these principles cannot be changed nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outside their ambit"".[11]: 35  He held that there were only the two recognised exceptions to the finding of a duty of care and supported Baron Alderson's judgment in Winterbottom v Wright that ""the only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract; if we go one step beyond that, there is no reason why we should not go fifty"".[6]: 43–44 [11]: 36 
Lord Buckmaster dismissed George v Skivington,[21] opining that ""few cases can have lived so dangerously and lived so long"",[11]: 37  and rejected Heaven as a tabula in naufragio (Latin: literally ""plank in a shipwreck"") that was unrelated to Donoghue's case; both ""should be buried so securely that their perturbed spirits shall no longer vex the law"".[11]: 42  He concluded that there was no common law support for Donoghue's claim and supported Lord Anderson's judgment in Mullen.[6]: 44–46 

In a case like the present, where the goods of the defenders are widely distributed throughout Scotland, it would seem little short of outrageous to make them responsible to members of the public for the condition of the contents of every bottle which issues from their works. It is obvious that, if such responsibility attached to the defenders, they might be called on to meet claims of damages which they could not possibly investigate or insure.[11]: 43 
The 1842 Versailles rail accident Lord Tomlin referred to, in which over 70 people died when a train derailed; the cause was a broken axle.[22]: 507 
Lord Tomlin concurred with Lord Buckmaster. While he agreed with Lord Atkin that the duty of care a manufacturer owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced, he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a sealed container made no difference to the finding of a such duty.[6]: 50 [11]: 57–58  He further endorsed concerns that Lord Atkin's broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the Versailles rail accident to be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer of the axle that broke and caused the crash.[3][11]: 57 
The suggested ratio decidendi (Latin: the reason for the decision) of the case has varied from the narrowest, jokingly suggested by Julius Stone, that there was merely a duty ""not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to Scots widows"",[23] to the widest, suggested by Lord Normand, who had been one of Stevenson's counsel, that Lord Atkin's neighbour principle was the ratio.[24]: 756–757 [1]: 7 
Although the neighbour principle was a critical part of Lord Atkin's reasoning, and was therefore part of the ratio of his judgment, neither of the other judges in the majority expressly endorsed the principle.[1]: 7–8  Robert Heuston therefore suggests that case only supports the claims there can be duties in tort even if there is no contract; that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumers of their goods; and possibly that negligence is a separate tort. ""No amount of posthumous citation can of itself transfer with retrospective effect a proposition from the status of obiter dictum [passing comments] to that of ratio decidendi.""[1]: 9 

Subsequent events[edit]
The legal basis for the claim now settled, the case was returned to the Court of Session for a hearing scheduled for January 1933. In the hearing, Donoghue would have to prove the factual elements of the case that she had claimed, including that there had been a snail in the ginger beer as a result of Stevenson's negligence and that this snail had caused her illness.[6]: 170  However, Stevenson died on 12 November 1932, aged 69.[6]: 7  One year later, Stevenson's executors were listed as third-party defenders to the case. However, the claim was settled out of court in December 1934[14]: 115  for, according to Leechman's son, £200 of the £500 originally claimed.[Note 5][3][6]: 171–173 

Gartloch Mental Hospital, where Donoghue died in 1958[6]: 6 
Donoghue had moved to 101 Maitland Street with her son, Henry, around February 1931. He moved out when he married in 1937, after which she moved to 156 Jamieson Street. She continued to work as a shop assistant. In February 1945, Donoghue divorced her husband, from whom she had separated in 1928 and who now had two sons by another woman, and reverted to using her maiden name.[6]: 5–6 [25]: 7 
She died of a heart attack on 19 March 1958, at the age of 59, in Gartloch Mental Hospital, where she had probably been staying for a short period of time as a result of mental illness.[25]: 8  Although she is listed on her death certificate as May McAllister, she was by then commonly known as Mabel Hannah, having adopted her mother's maiden name and the first name of her daughter, who had died when she was eleven days old.[2][25]: 5, 8 [26]: 2 
Stevenson's business was taken over by his widow, Mary, and his son, the third David Stevenson in the family. It became a limited company (David Stevenson (Beers and Minerals) Limited) on 1 July 1950; the family sold their shares in 1956. The Glen Lane manufacturing plant was demolished in the 1960s.[6]: 7 
The Wellmeadow Café, where the snail had been found, closed around 1931; the building was demolished in 1959. Minghella, its owner, subsequently became a labourer; he died on 20 March 1970.[6]: 2–3 

Significance[edit]
Lord Atkin's neighbour principle, that people must take reasonable care not to injure others who could foreseeably be affected by their action or inaction, was supported by reference to the biblical Great Commandment (to love one’s neighbour as oneself) and the Parable of the Good Samaritan (defining who that “neighbour” was).[27]: 212–213 
The neighbour principle itself was first mentioned in relation to law by Francis Buller[Note 6] in An Introduction to the Law relative to Trials at Nisi Prius, which was printed in 1768.[27]: 212 

Of Injuries arising from Negligence or Folly. Every man ought to take reasonable care that he does not injure his neighbour; therefore, wherever a man receives any hurt through the default of another, though the same were not wilful, yet if it be occasioned by negligence or folly, the law gives him an action to recover damages for the injury so sustained.[28]
In precedent, there was an obiter suggestion by Lord Esher in Heaven v Pender that ""whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another that every one of ordinary sense ... would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct ... he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger"".[19]: 509  However, this approach had been rejected by the two other judges in the Court of Appeal.[14]: 107–108  Lord Esher's attempt to reintroduce the principle in further obiter remarks in Le Lievre v Gould,[29] in which he stated that Heaven only established that there may be a duty even if there is no contract and that this duty arose if there was proximity between the parties, was also unsuccessful.[14]: 108–109 [29]: 497 
Two cases from the New York Court of Appeals, Thomas v. Winchester[30] and MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., were also influential in the formation of the neighbour principle.[6]: 102  In Thomas, Thomas had purchased and administered belladonna to his wife after it was mislabelled by Winchester, the dealer, although not the seller, of the treatment as extract of dandelion. Thomas' wife became seriously ill as a consequence and Thomas successfully claimed in negligence; Winchester's behaviour had created an imminent danger which justified a finding of a duty of care.[6]: 102–103 
This principle was relied on in MacPherson, in which a car wheel collapsed, injuring MacPherson. The manufacturer was sued in negligence and the court held that manufacturers could owe their ultimate consumers a duty of care in limited circumstances.[6]: 104–106 [31]: 414 

If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully ... If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.[20]: 389–390 
Lord Atkin used the concept of legal neighbours in an address to the University of Birmingham's Holdsworth Club on 9 May 1930, in which he commented that ""the man who swears unto his neighbour and disappointeth him not is a person commended by the law of morality, and the Law enforces that by an action for breach of contract"".[6]: 111  On 28 October 1931, just over one month before he heard Donoghue, Lord Atkin also used the principle in relation to defamation, perjury, fraud and negligence in a lecture at King's College London.[27]: 211 

[A man] is not to injure his neighbour by acts of negligence; and that certainly covers a very large field of the law. I doubt whether the whole law of tort could not be comprised in the golden maxim to do unto your neighbour as you would that he should do unto you.[Note 7][33]: 30 
Precedent[edit]
The case was reviewed by Frederick Pollock in a 1933 edition of Law Quarterly Review, in which he commented that there was no doubt as to the importance of the decision and that ""a notable step has been made in enlarging and clarifying our conception of a citizen's duty before the law ... not to turn dangerous or noxious things loose on the world"".[34]: 22  However, Donoghue otherwise attracted little attention; it was understood only as precedent that manufacturers were liable for injuries their goods cause their ultimate consumers rather than that there was a general principle of liability in negligence.[35]: 61 
The majority of the Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Cohen and Lord Justice Asquith) therefore held in Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co[36] that Donoghue had not affected tortious liability for negligent misstatement.[35]: 61  This narrow understanding of Donoghue changed with the cases of Hedley Byrne v Heller[37] in 1963 and Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co[38] in 1970.[6]: 116–117 

Hedley Byrne v Heller[edit]
In Hedley Byrne, Hedley Byrne, advertising agents, had been indirectly informed by Heller & Partners Ltd, the bankers of Easipower, a company wishing to place a large order, that Easipower was a ""respectably constituted company, considered good for its ordinary business engagements"".[35]: 62  Hedley Byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £17,000 when Easipower went into liquidation. The House of Lords held that Heller owed Hedley Byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for Hedley Byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company (although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a disclaimer of responsibility included in Heller's letter).[6]: 127–128 
The application of Donoghue was discussed and, while all the judges agreed that it would be taking Donoghue too far to immediately apply it to Hedley Byrne, Lord Devlin suggested that ""what Lord Atkin did was to use his general conception [the neighbour principle] to open up a category of cases giving rise to a special duty"" and that the case could incrementally expand the duty of care.[6]: 128–129 [37]: 524–525 

Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co[edit]
Brownsea Island, where some young offenders were taken in an apparent attempt to replicate Brownsea Island Scout camp[6]: 129 
Home Office was the culmination of a movement from duties of care being found in specific circumstances to using the neighbour principle as a general duty of care.[39]: 150  In Home Office, the Home Office had in 1962 taken a group of boys from a borstal to Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, where seven had escaped overnight and collided one yacht with another belonging to Dorset Yacht Company.[38]: 1025  The company sued the Home Office for negligence and a preliminary issue, whether the Home Office owed a duty of care to Dorset Yacht Company, was found in the company's favour by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The case was appealed to the House of Lords, who held by a majority that the Home Office did owe a duty of care.[6]: 129–130 
Lord Reid, giving the leading judgment, rejected the argument that there was no precedent for the claim, instead acknowledging ""a steady trend towards regarding the law of negligence as depending on principle so that, when a new point emerges, one should ask not whether it is covered by authority but whether recognised principles [from Donoghue] apply to it"".[38]: 1026–1027  Donoghue, he argued, should therefore be applied in almost all circumstances.[6]: 132–133 

[Donoghue] may be regarded as a milestone, and the well-known passage in Lord Atkin's speech should I think be regarded as a statement of principle. It is not to be treated as if it were a statutory definition. It will require qualification in new circumstances. But I think that the time has come when we can and should say that it ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion.[38]: 1027 
In the sole dissenting judgment, Viscount Dilhorne held that the neighbour principle could not have been intended to be applied in all circumstances and that it could only be used to determine to whom a duty of care is owed rather than if one exists.[38]: 1043–1042  Judges, he opined, ""are concerned not with what the law should be but with what it is. The absence of authority shows that no such duty [to Dorset Yacht Company] now exists. If there should be one, that is, in my view, a matter for the legislature and not for the courts"".[38]: 1045  Chapman comments ""that this conclusion appeared ... distinctly quaint, old-fashioned and even untenable in the light of [Donoghue] shows how far the law had moved in the four decades which separated the two House of Lords decisions"".[6]: 134 

Caparo Industries plc v Dickman[edit]
In 1990, the House of Lords revised Lord Atkin's ""neighbour"" principle to encompass public policy concerns articulated in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman.[40] The three-stage Caparo test for establishing a duty of care requires (i) foreseeability of damage, (ii) a relationship characterised by the law as one of proximity or neighbourhood and (iii) that the situation should be one in which the court considers it would be fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of given scope on one party for the benefit of the other. In other jurisdictions, such as New Zealand, there is now a two-part test for novel fact situations, where the establishment of a duty must be balanced against applicable policy matters.

Comparative law[edit]
The judgment and reasoning of Lord Atkin in Donoghue v Stevenson is very similar to the judgment and reasoning applied by Cardozo CJ in the American case of Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.,[41] four years earlier.  Although the similarity in approach has been noted by commentators,[42] the decision is  Palsgraf was not cited in either argument or in the judgments in Donoghue, although Lord Atkin did refer to an earlier decision of Cardozo J: MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co..[43]

As a metaphor[edit]
Today the far reaching changes of the decision for the law of torts is sufficiently well recognised that the case's name is used as a metaphor.  For example, Barclays Bank v W J Simms [1980] 1 QB 677 has been described as ""the Donoghue v Stevenson of restitution for mistake.""[44] It has also been stated that Slade's Case ""could be said to be the Donoghue v. Stevenson of contract.""[45] Similarly, Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd[46] has been called ""the Donoghue v Stevenson of Tourism Law"".[47]

Commemoration[edit]
A memorial to the case on the former site of the Wellmeadow Cafe.
In 1990, a pilgrimage to Paisley was organised by the Canadian Bar Association, the Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland. This included a conference in Paisley Town Hall entitled ""The Pilgrimage to Paisley: a Salute to Donoghue v Stevenson"".[6]: 173–174  A memorial commemorating the case was unveiled at the conference on the site of the former Wellmeadow Café[3][48] and a bench was added in 1992; both were replaced in 2012.[49]
In 1996, retired Canadian judge Martin Taylor together with David Hay QC and Michael Doherty produced a documentary on the case: The Paisley Snail.[50][51]

Existence of the snail[edit]
The existence of the Paisley Snail has been doubted.
In a speech scheduled to be delivered in May 1942 (although delayed by the Second World War), Lord Justice MacKinnon jokingly suggested that it had been proven that Donoghue did not find a snail in the bottle.

To be quite candid, I detest that snail ... I think that [Lord Normand] did not reveal to you that when the law had been settled by the House of Lords, the case went back to Edinburgh to be tried on the facts. And at that trial it was found that there never was a snail in the bottle at all. That intruding gastropod was as much a legal fiction as the Casual Ejector.[6]: 170–171 
This allegation, suggests Chapman, established itself as a legal myth;[6]: 172  it was repeated by Lord Justice Jenkins in a 1954 Court of Appeal practice note.[52]: 1483  However, both MacKinnon and Jenkins were unaware that the trial had not gone ahead because of Stevenson's death, and the events following the case were only published in response to the practice note.[53] As Donoghue's factual claims were therefore never tested in court, it is generally held that what happened in the Wellmeadow Café is not proven and will not be known for certain.[1]: 2 [3][4]: 643 [6]: 172 

Notes[edit]


^ Scots law practice was to include both the married and maiden names of female litigants in the form ""maiden name (or married name)"".[1]: 1  The maiden name for Donoghue, however, has been listed as both ""McAlister"" and ""M'Alister"" in the law reports, even though she was born May McAllister.[2] ""(Pauper)"" indicates that Donoghue would have been unable to pay Stevenson's costs had she lost, but was granted an exemption from providing the required security.[3]

^ Although the friend was not named and has not been identified, she is referred to as ""she"" in the House of Lords judgment.[3][7]: 605  It has been suggested that this information was provided by counsel during the hearing.[6]: 5 

^ Minghella's surname was incorrectly spelt as ""Minchella"" in law reports of Donoghue v Stevenson.[6]: 2 

^ Judgment was originally scheduled for 14 April, but was delayed for unknown reasons (although Alan Roger suggests that the delay gave Lord Macmillan time to rewrite his speech).[18]: 247 

^ It has also been reported that the case was settled for £100 (by William McBryde on the basis of information from Lord Macmillan, which he probably heard from Lord Normand, one of Stevenson's counsel) and £500 (by Thomas Donoghue, May Donoghue's grandson; however, this amount is likely to be an exaggeration as it was the amount Donoghue originally claimed).[6]: 173 [25]: 9 

^ Although authorship of An Introduction to the Law relative to Trials at Nisi Prius has also been attributed to Lord Bathurst.[6]: 87 

^ The original version of the Golden Maxim requires that ""thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.""[27]: 212 [32]

"
What is the BlackEnergy malware?,"BlackEnergy is a type of malware that was first discovered in 2007. It is a form of advanced persistent threat (APT) malware that is designed to gain access to a victim's computer systems and steal sensitive information.

BlackEnergy is believed to have been created by North Korean hackers, who have been using it to target a wide range of organizations, including government agencies, financial institutions, and private companies. The malware is known for its ability to remain undetected for extended periods of time, and it has been used to conduct a number of high-profile attacks on critical infrastructure, including power grids and financial systems.

Some specific details about BlackEnergy malware include:

* The malware has been used to target organizations in a number of countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
* The malware is believed to have been used to steal sensitive information, including financial data, intellectual property, and personal information.
* The malware is known to be highly persistent, and it can remain active on a victim's computer system for months or even years.
* The malware is believed to be capable of bypassing security measures, including firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems.
* The malware is believed to be capable of spreading itself through a variety of methods, including email attachments, infected websites, and removable storage devices.

It's important to note that the BlackEnergy malware is just one example of the many types of malware that are used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information and disrupt critical infrastructure. The threat posed by malware is constantly evolving, and organizations and individuals need to stay up-to-date on the latest threats and best practices for protecting against them.",True,https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-alerts/ir-alert-h-16-056-01,"

ICS Alert

Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure



Last RevisedJuly 20, 2021

Alert CodeIR-ALERT-H-16-056-01












Description

On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian power companies experienced unscheduled power outages impacting a large number of customers in Ukraine. This report provides an account of the events that took place based on interviews with company personnel. 
Updated July 20, 2021: The U.S. Government attributes this activity to Russian nation-state cyber actors and assess that Russian nation-state cyber actors conducted a cyber campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. For more information on Russian malicious cyber activity, refer to us-cert.cisa.gov/Russia.
SUMMARY
On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian power companies experienced unscheduled power outages impacting a large number of customers in Ukraine. In addition, there have also been reports of malware found in Ukrainian companies in a variety of critical infrastructure sectors. Public reports indicate that the BlackEnergy (BE) malware was discovered on the companies’ computer networks, however it is important to note that the role of BE in this event remains unknown pending further technical analysis.
An interagency team comprised of representatives from the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)/Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), Department of Energy, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation traveled to Ukraine to collaborate and gain more insight. The Ukrainian government worked closely and openly with the U.S. team and shared information to help prevent future cyber-attacks.
This report provides an account of the events that took place based on interviews with company personnel. This report is being shared for situational awareness and network defense purposes. ICS-CERT strongly encourages organizations across all sectors to review and employ the mitigation strategies listed below.
Additional information on this incident including technical indicators can be found in the TLP GREEN alert (IR-ALERT-H-16-043-01P and subsequent updates) that was released to the US-CERT secure portal. US critical infrastructure asset owners and operators can request access to this information by emailing ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov.
DETAILS
The following account of events is based on the interagency team’s interviews with operations and information technology staff and leadership at six Ukrainian organizations with first-hand experience of the event. Following these discussions and interviews, the team assesses that the outages experienced on December 23, 2015, were caused by external cyber-attackers. The team was not able to independently review technical evidence of the cyber-attack; however, a significant number of independent reports from the team’s interviews as well as documentary findings corroborate the events as outlined below.
Through interviews with impacted entities, the team learned that power outages were caused by remote cyber intrusions at three regional electric power distribution companies (Oblenergos) impacting approximately 225,000 customers. While power has been restored, all the impacted Oblenergos continue to run under constrained operations. In addition, three other organizations, some from other critical infrastructure sectors, were also intruded upon but did not experience operational impacts  
The cyber-attack was reportedly synchronized and coordinated, probably following extensive reconnaissance of the victim networks. According to company personnel, the cyber-attacks at each company occurred within 30 minutes of each other and impacted multiple central and regional facilities. During the cyber-attacks, malicious remote operation of the breakers was conducted by multiple external humans using either existing remote administration tools at the operating system level or remote industrial control system (ICS) client software via virtual private network (VPN) connections. The companies believe that the actors acquired legitimate credentials prior to the cyber-attack to facilitate remote access.
All three companies indicated that the actors wiped some systems by executing the KillDisk malware at the conclusion of the cyber-attack. The KillDisk malware erases selected files on target systems and corrupts the master boot record, rendering systems inoperable. It was further reported that in at least one instance, Windows-based human-machine interfaces (HMIs) embedded in remote terminal units were also overwritten with KillDisk. The actors also rendered Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations inoperable by corrupting their firmware. In addition, the actors reportedly scheduled disconnects for server Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) via the UPS remote management interface. The team assesses that these actions were done in an attempt to interfere with expected restoration efforts.
Each company also reported that they had been infected with BlackEnergy malware however we do not know whether the malware played a role in the cyber-attacks. The malware was reportedly delivered via spear phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office attachments. It is suspected that BlackEnergy may have been used as an initial access vector to acquire legitimate credentials; however, this information is still being evaluated. It is important to underscore that any remote access Trojan could have been used and none of BlackEnergy’s specific capabilities were reportedly leveraged.
MITIGATION
The first, most important step in cybersecurity is implementation of information resources management best practices. Key examples include: procurement and licensing of trusted hardware and software systems; knowing who and what is on your network through hardware and software asset management automation; on time patching of systems; and strategic technology refresh.
Organizations should develop and exercise contingency plans that allow for the safe operation or shutdown of operational processes in the event that their ICS is breached. These plans should include the assumption that the ICS is actively working counter to the safe operation of the process.
ICS-CERT recommends that asset owners take defensive measures by leveraging best practices to minimize the risk from similar malicious cyber activity.
Application Whitelisting (AWL) can detect and prevent attempted execution of malware uploaded by malicious actors. The static nature of some systems, such as database servers and HMI computers, make these ideal candidates to run AWL. Operators are encouraged to work with their vendors to baseline and calibrate AWL deployments.NCCIC/ICS-CERT, Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Seven%20Steps%20to%20Effectively%20Defend%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf, web site last accessed February 25, 2016.
Organizations should isolate ICS networks from any untrusted networks, especially the Internet. All unused ports should be locked down and all unused services turned off. If a defined business requirement or control function exists, only allow real-time connectivity to external networks. If one-way communication can accomplish a task, use optical separation (“data diode”). If bidirectional communication is necessary, then use a single open port over a restricted network path.a
Organizations should also limit Remote Access functionality wherever possible. Modems are especially insecure. Users should implement “monitoring only” access that is enforced by data diodes, and do not rely on “read only” access enforced by software configurations or permissions. Remote persistent vendor connections should not be allowed into the control network. Remote access should be operator controlled, time limited, and procedurally similar to “lock out, tag out.” The same remote access paths for vendor and employee connections can be used; however, double standards should not be allowed. Strong multi-factor authentication should be used if possible, avoiding schemes where both tokens are similar types and can be easily stolen (e.g., password and soft certificate).a
As in common networking environments, control system domains can be subject to a myriad of vulnerabilities that can provide malicious actors with a “backdoor” to gain unauthorized access. Often, backdoors are simple shortcomings in the architecture perimeter, or embedded capabilities that are forgotten, unnoticed, or simply disregarded. Malicious actors often do not require physical access to a domain to gain access to it and will usually leverage any discovered access functionality. Modern networks, especially those in the control systems arena, often have inherent capabilities that are deployed without sufficient security analysis and can provide access to malicious actors once they are discovered. These backdoors can be accidentally created in various places on the network, but it is the network perimeter that is of greatest concern.
When looking at network perimeter components, the modern IT architecture will have technologies to provide for robust remote access. These technologies often include firewalls, public facing services, and wireless access. Each technology will allow enhanced communications in and amongst affiliated networks and will often be a subsystem of a much larger and more complex information infrastructure. However, each of these components can (and often do) have associated security vulnerabilities that an adversary will try to detect and leverage. Interconnected networks are particularly attractive to a malicious actor, because a single point of compromise may provide extended access because of pre-existing trust established among interconnected resources.NCCIC/ICS-CERT, Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf , web site last accessed February 25, 2016.
ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.
ICS-CERT also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov). Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies and Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems.
Organizations that observe any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

DETECTION
While the role of BlackEnergy in this incident is still being evaluated, the malware was reported to be present on several systems. Detection of the BlackEnergy malware should be conducted using the latest published YARA signature. This can be found at: https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-281-01E. Additional information about using YARA signatures can be found in the May/June 2015 ICS-CERT Monitor available at: https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/monitors/ICS-MM201506.
Additional information on this incident including technical indicators can be found in the TLP GREEN alert (IR-ALERT-H-16-043-01P and subsequent updates) that was released to the US-CERT secure portal. US critical infrastructure asset owners and operators can request access to this information by emailing ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov.

"
What is the purpose of the United States repatriation program?,"The United States repatriation program was a series of efforts made by the U.S. government to bring back citizens who had been taken captive by the Axis powers during World War II. The program was established in 1942 and was run by the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI). The COI was responsible for coordinating all repatriation efforts, including the collection of information about missing persons, the organization of search parties, and the provision of financial assistance to families affected by the loss of a loved one.

The repatriation program was initially focused on bringing back U.S. citizens who had been taken captive by the Japanese during the war. The first group of U.S. citizens to be repatriated was a group of 101 prisoners of war who were released from Japanese captivity in 1945. The COI worked with the War Department to organize the repatriation of these prisoners and to provide them with the necessary medical care and transportation to return home.

The repatriation program was also focused on bringing back U.S. citizens who had been taken captive by the Germans during the war. The first group of U.S. citizens to be repatriated from German captivity was a group of 15 prisoners of war who were released in 1945. The COI worked with the War Department to organize the repatriation of these prisoners and to provide them with the necessary medical care and transportation to return home.

The repatriation program was also focused on bringing back U.S. citizens who had been taken captive by the Italians during the war. The first group of U.S. citizens to be repatriated from Italian captivity was a group of 17 prisoners of war who were released in 1945. The COI worked with the War Department to organize the repatriation of these prisoners and to provide them with the necessary medical care and transportation to return home.

The repatriation program was also focused on bringing back U.S. citizens who had been taken captive by the Vichy French during the war. The first group of U.S. citizens to be repatriated from Vichy French captivity was a group of 25 prisoners of war who were released in 1945. The COI worked with the War Department to organize the repatriation of these prisoners and to provide them with the necessary medical care and transportation to return home.

The repatriation program was also focused on bringing back U.S. citizens who had been taken captive by the Italians in North Africa. The first group of U.S. citizens to be repatriated from Italian captivity in North Africa was a group of 25 prisoners of war who were released in 1945. The COI worked with the War Department to organize the repatriation of these prisoners and to provide them with the necessary medical care and transportation to return home.

Overall, the United States repatriation program was a series of efforts made by the U.S. government to bring back citizens who had been taken captive by the Axis powers during World War II. The program was run by the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) and was focused on bringing back U.S. citizens who had been taken captive by the Japanese, Germans, Italians, and Vichy French during the war. The program was successful in bringing back many U.S. citizens and was a testament to the U.S. government's commitment to its citizens during a time of war.",False,https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohsepr/repatriation,"

      Overview
  

 

The U.S. Repatriation Program (“the Program”) was established in 1935 under Section 1113 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1313) to provide temporary assistance to U.S. citizens and their dependents who have been identified by the U.S. Department of State as having returned, or been brought from a foreign country, to the United States because of destitution, illness, war, threat of war, or a similar crisis, and because they are without resources immediately accessible to meet their needs. 

The Program is managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Administration for Children and Families’ (ACF) Office of Human Services Emergency Preparedness and Response (OHSEPR). 
Each day, OHSEPR and its grantee utilize routine repatriation procedures to support U.S. citizens that are returned to the United States by the U.S. Department of State. During emergency repatriation incidents, OHSEPR leads federal planning, coordination, and execution of domestic repatriation plans and operations.
The U.S. Repatriation Program helped over 800 individuals repatriate to the United States in FY20, including unaccompanied U.S. citizen minors and those experiencing mental illness. Repatriates were able to meet their basic needs by gaining access to shelter, transportation, medical care, and more. Read more in our FY2020 U.S. Repatriation Program infographic.

Judith Pamela Butler[1] (born February 24, 1956) is an American feminist philosopher and gender studies scholar whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics, and the fields of third-wave feminism,[2] queer theory,[3] and literary theory.[4]
In 1993, Butler joined the faculty in the Department of Rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, where they[a] became the Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program in Critical Theory in 1998. They also hold the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School (EGS).[7]
Butler is best known for their books Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) and Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex (1993), in which they challenge conventional, heteronormative notions of gender and develop their theory of gender performativity. This theory has had a major influence on feminist and queer scholarship.[8] Their work is often studied and debated in film studies courses emphasizing gender studies and performativity.
Butler has spoken on many contemporary political questions, including Israeli politics and in support of LGBT rights.[9][10][11]


Early life and education[edit]
Judith Butler was born on February 24, 1956, in Cleveland, Ohio,[1] to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent.[12] Most of their maternal grandmother's family was murdered in the Shoah.[13] Butler's parents were practicing Reform Jews. Their mother was raised Orthodox, eventually becoming Conservative and then Reform, while their father was raised Reform. As a child and teenager, Butler attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where they received their ""first training in philosophy"". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with Haaretz that they began the ethics classes at the age of 14, and that they were created as a form of punishment by Butler's Hebrew school's rabbi because they were ""too talkative in class"".[13] Butler said they were ""thrilled"" by the idea of these tutorials. When asked what they wanted to study in these special sessions, Butler responded with three questions preoccupying them at the time: ""Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?""[14]
Butler attended Bennington College before transferring to Yale University, where they studied philosophy and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1978 and a PhD in 1984.[15] Their studies fell primarily under the traditions of German Idealism and phenomenology,[16] and they spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright Scholar in 1979.[17] After receiving their PhD, Butler revised their doctoral dissertation to produce their first book, entitled Subjects of Desire: Hegelian Reflections in Twentieth Century France (1987).[18] Butler went on to teach at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, in 1993.[19] In 2002, they held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam.[20] In addition, they joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.[21][22][23][24]
Butler serves on the editorial or advisory board of several academic journals, including Janus Unbound: Journal of Critical Studies,[25] JAC: A Journal of Rhetoric, Culture, and Politics and Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society.[26][27]

Performative Acts and Gender Constitution (1988)[edit]
In the essay ""Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory,"" Judith Butler proposes that gender is performative – that is, gender is not so much a static identity or role, but rather comprises a set of acts which can evolve over time.[28] Butler states that because gender identity is established through behavior, there is a possibility to construct different genders via different behaviors.[29] ""...if gender is instituted through acts which are internally discontinuous, then the appearance of substance is precisely that, a constructed identity, a performative accomplishment which the mundane social audience, including the actors themselves, come to believe and to perform in the mode of belief. If the ground of gender identity is the stylized repetition of acts through time, and not a seemingly seamless identity, then the possibilities of gender transformation are to be found in the arbitrary relation between such acts, in the possibility of a different sort of repeating, in the breaking or subversive repetition of that style.""[30]Butler concludes their essay with a personal reflection on the strengths and limitations of widespread feminist theories which function on a solely binary perception of gender. Butler critiques what they call the ""reification"" of sexual difference within a heterosexual framework, and articulates their concern with how this framework affects the accurate presentation (or lack thereof) of ""femaleness"" across a diverse array of experiences, including those of women.[31]""As a corporeal field of cultural play, gender is a basically innovative affair, although it is quite clear that there are strict punishments for contesting the script by performing out of turn or through unwarranted improvisations. Gender is not passively scripted on the body, and neither is it determined by nature, language, the symbolic, or the overwhelming history of patriarchy. Gender is what is put on, invariably, under constraint, daily and incessantly, with anxiety and pleasure, but if this continuous act is mistaken for a natural or linguistic given, power is relinquished to expand the cultural field bodily through subversive performances of various kinds.""[32]Throughout this text, Butler derives influence from French philosophers such as Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, particularly de Beauvoir's The Second Sex and Merleau-Ponty's ""The Body in its Sexual Being."" Butler also cites works by Gayle Rubin, Mary Anne Warren, and their own piece ""Sex and Gender in Simone de Beauvoir's Second Sex"" (1986), among others.
Gender Trouble (1990)[edit]
Main article: Gender Trouble
Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity was first published in 1990, selling over 100,000 copies internationally, in multiple languages.[33] Similar to ""Performative Acts and Gender Constitution,"" Gender Trouble discusses the works of Sigmund Freud, Simone de Beauvoir, Julia Kristeva, Jacques Lacan, Luce Irigaray, Monique Wittig, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault.[34]
Butler offers a critique of the terms gender and sex as they have been used by feminists.[35] Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make ""women"" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations. Butler believes that feminists should not try to define ""women"" and they also believe that feminists should ""focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement.""[36] Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be ""flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors"" (David Gauntlett).[37] The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as performative, not an essence, has become one of the foundations of queer theory.[38][39]

Imitation and Gender Insubordination (1991)[edit]
Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories is a collection of writings of gay and lesbian social theorists. Butler's contribution argues that no transparent revelation is afforded by using the terms ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" yet there is a political imperative to do so.[40] Butler employs ""the concepts of play/performance, drag, and imitation"" to describe the formation of gender and sexuality as continually created subjectivities always at risk of dissolution from non-performance.""[41]

Bodies That Matter (1993)[edit]
Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex seeks to clear up readings and supposed misinterpretations of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice.[42] As such, Butler aims to answer questions of this vein that may have been raised from their previous work Gender Trouble. Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of Derrida's theory of iterability, which is a form of citationality:Performativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed by a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.[43]Butler also explores how gender can be understood not only as a performance, but also as a ""constitutive constraint,"" or constructed character. They ask how this conceptualization of an individual's gender contributes to notions of bodily intelligibility, or comprehension, by other individuals. Butler continues to discuss bodily intelligibility by means of sex as a ""materialized"" entity, upon which cultural, collective ideals of gender can be built. From this angle, Butler interrogates value conscription upon various bodies as determined theories and practices of heterosexual predominance.[44] If gender consists of the social meanings that sex assumes, then sex does not accrue social meanings as additive properties but, rather, is replaced by the social meanings it takes on; sex is relinquished in the course of that assumption, and gender emerges, not as a term in a continued relationship of opposition to sex, but as the term which absorbs and displaces ""sex,"" the mark of its full substantiation into gender or what, from a materialist point of view, might constitute a full de-substantiation.[45]While continuing to draw upon sources such as those of Plato, Irigaray, Lacan, and Freud (as they did for Gender Trouble), Butler also draws upon pieces of documentary film and literature for Bodies That Matter. Such pieces include the film Paris is Burning, short stories by Willa Cather, and the novel Passing by Nella Larsen.
Excitable Speech (1997)[edit]
Further information: Performativity § Judith Butler
In Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative, Butler surveys the problems of hate speech and censorship. They argue that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.[46]
Butler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon's argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.[47]
Deploying Foucault's argument from the first volume of The History of Sexuality, Butler states that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.[48] As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th-century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control.[49] Extending this argument using Derrida and Lacan, Butler says that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic ""I"" is a mere effect of a primitive censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; ""If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech"".[50]

Precarious Life (2004)[edit]
Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence opens a new line in Judith Butler's work that has had a great impact on their subsequent thought, especially on books like Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable? (2009) or Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly (2015), as well as on other contemporary thinkers.[51][52][53] In this book, Butler deals with issues of precarity, vulnerability, grief and contemporary political violence in the face of the War on terror and the realities of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and similar detention centers. Drawing on Foucault, they characterize the form of power at work in these places of ""indefinite detention"" as a convergence of sovereignty and governmentality. The ""state of exception"" deployed here is in fact more complex than the one pointed out by Agamben in his Homo Sacer, since the government is in a more ambiguous relation to law —it may comply with it or suspend it, depending on its interests, and this is itself a tool of the state to produce its own sovereignty.[54] Butler also points towards problems in international law treatises like the Geneva Conventions. In practice, these only protect people who belong to (or act in the name of) a recognized state, and therefore are helpless in situations of abuse toward stateless people, people who do not enjoy a recognized citizenship or people who are labelled ""terrorists"", and therefore understood as acting on their own behalf as irrational ""killing machines"" that need to be held captive due to their ""dangerousness"".[55]
Butler also writes here on vulnerability and precariousness as intrinsic to the human condition. This is due to our inevitable interdependency from other precarious subjects, who are never really ""complete"" or autonomous but instead always ""dispossessed"" on the Other. This is manifested in shared experiences like grief and loss, that can form the basis for a recognition of our shared human (vulnerable) condition.[56] However, not every loss can be mourned in the same way, and in fact not every life can be conceived of as such (as situated in a condition common to ours).[57] Through a critical engagement with Levinas, they will explore how certain representations prevent lives from being considered worthy of being lived or taken into account, precluding the mourning of certain Others, and with that the recognition of them and their losses as equally human.[58] This preoccupation with the dignifying or dehumanizing role of practices of framing and representations will constitute one of the central elements of Frames of War (2009).

Undoing Gender (2004)[edit]
Main article: Undoing Gender
Undoing Gender collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of their other books. Butler revisits and refines their notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing ""restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life"".[citation needed]
Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is ""automatic or mechanical"". They argue that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of ""human"" and ""less-than-human"" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a ""viable life"" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if their desires differ from normality. Butler states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life ""unlivable"". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.[59]
In Butler's discussion of intersex issues and people, Butler addresses the case of David Reimer, a person whose sex was medically reassigned from male to female after a botched circumcision at eight months of age. Reimer was ""made"" female by doctors, but later in life identified as ""really"" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl, which he wrote with John Colapinto. Reimer died by suicide in 2004.[60]

Giving an Account of Oneself (2005)[edit]
In Giving an Account of Oneself, Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from Theodor Adorno, Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean Laplanche, Adriana Cavarero and Emmanuel Levinas, Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. Butler theorizes the subject in relation to the social – a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical ""I"", in the first place.
Butler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.

You may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking ""I"" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final ""irresponsibility,"" one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament (page 78).
Instead Butler argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.[61][62]

Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly (2015)[edit]
Not to be confused with Performative activism.
In Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly, Butler discusses the power of public gatherings, considering what they signify and how they work.[63] They use this framework to analyze the power and possibilities of protests, such as the Black Lives Matter protests regarding the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014.

The Force of Nonviolence (2020)[edit]
In The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind, Butler connects the ideologies of nonviolence and the political struggle for social equality. They review the traditional understanding of ""nonviolence,"" stating that it ""is often misunderstood as a passive practice that emanates from a calm region of the soul, or as an individualist ethical relation to existing forms of power.""[64] Instead of this understanding, Butler argues that ""nonviolence is an ethical position found in the midst of the political field.""[64]

Who's Afraid of Gender? (2024)[edit]
Main article: Who's Afraid of Gender?
In Who's Afraid of Gender?, Butler explores the roots of current anti-trans rhetoric, which they define as a ""phantasm"" that aligns itself with emerging authoritarian movements.[2] Butler was inspired to write this book after being attacked in 2017 in Brazil while speaking, at least one of whom shouted at Butler, saying ""Take your ideology to hell!""[3] Butler is interested in the literal demonization of gender by analyzing the historical context of the anti-gender movement.[7] The book has been described as ""the most accessible of their books so far, an intervention meant for a wide audience"".[65]

Reception[edit]
Butler's work has been influential in feminist and queer theory, cultural studies, and continental philosophy.[66] Their contribution to a range of other disciplines, such as psychoanalysis, literary, film, and performance studies as well as visual arts, has also been significant.[4] Their theory of gender performativity as well as their conception of ""critically queer"" have heavily influenced understandings of gender and queer identity in the academic world, and have shaped and mobilized various kinds of political activism, particularly queer activism, internationally.[66][67][68][69] Butler's work has also entered into contemporary debates on the teaching of gender, gay parenting, and the depathologization of transgender people.[70][71]
Some academics and political activists see in Butler a departure from the sex/gender dichotomy and a non-essentialist conception of gender—along with an insistence that power helps form the subject—an idea whose introduction purportedly brought new insights to feminist and queer praxis, thought, and studies.[72] Darin Barney of McGill University wrote that:

Butler's work on gender, sex, sexuality, queerness, feminism, bodies, political speech and ethics has changed the way scholars all over the world think, talk and write about identity, subjectivity, power and politics. It has also changed the lives of countless people whose bodies, genders, sexualities and desires have made them subject to violence, exclusion and oppression.[73]
Postmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that sex is itself constructed through language, a view notably propounded in Butler's 1990 book, Gender Trouble.[74][75] Consequently, Butler's work is passible of criticism by modernist and anti-relativist critics of postmodernism who deplore the idea that categories spoken about in the natural sciences (e.g., sex) are socially constructed.
In 1998, Denis Dutton's journal Philosophy and Literature awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual ""Bad Writing Competition"", which set out to ""celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles"", which Butler responded to.[76][b]
Some critics have accused Butler of elitism due to their difficult prose style, while others state that Butler reduces gender to ""discourse"" or promotes[77][78][79][80][81][82] a form of gender voluntarism – Doctrine prioritizing will over intellect. Susan Bordo, for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language and has contended that the body is a major part of gender, in opposition to Butler's conception of gender as performative.[83] A particularly vocal critic has been feminist Martha Nussbaum, who has argued that Butler misreads J. L. Austin's idea of performative utterance, makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no ""normative theory of social justice and human dignity.""[84] Finally, Nancy Fraser's critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists. Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances them from ""everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves. ... Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?""[85] Butler responded to criticisms in the preface to the 1999-edition Gender Trouble by asking suggestively whether there is ""a value to be derived from...experiences of linguistic difficulty.""[86]
More recently, several critics — such as semiotician Viviane Namaste[87]
— have criticised Judith Butler's Undoing Gender for under-emphasizing the intersectional aspects of gender-based violence. For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like ""gender politics"" and ""gender violence"" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can ""[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialized urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work"", and produce instead ""a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out"".[88]
German feminist Alice Schwarzer speaks of Butler's ""radical intellectual games"" that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising their right to same-sex-marriage in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend Islam, including Islamism, from critics.[89]
EGS philosophy professor Geoffrey Bennington, translator for many of Derrida's books, criticised Butler's introduction to the 1997 translation of Derrida's 1967 Of Grammatology.[c]

Non-academic[edit]
São Paulo, Brazil. An Inside Higher Ed article notes that before a democracy conference in Brazil ""Butler was burned in effigy as police kept groups of protesters – for and against Butler – apart. A pink bra was attached to the figure that was burned"". Some protesters ""held crosses and Brazilian flags in the air.""[91] Before a 2017 democracy conference in Brazil,[91] Butler was burnt in effigy.[92][93][94][95]
Bruno Perreau has written that Butler was literally depicted as an ""antichrist"", both because of their gender and their Jewish identity, the fear of minority politics and critical studies being expressed through fantasies of a corrupted body.[96]

Political activism[edit]
Much of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and they served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.[97] Over the years, Butler has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements.[9] They have also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay. More recently, Butler has been active in the Occupy movement and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.[citation needed]
They emphasize that Israel does not, and should not, be taken to represent all Jews or Jewish opinions. [vague][98] Butler is an outspoken critic of many aspects of contemporary Israel's actions[99][100] and has criticized some forms of Zionism.[101] Butler has been variously identified as post-Zionist[102][100] and anti-Zionist but is reluctant to embrace such labels, saying in 2013, ""I prefer to [provide] a story rather than a category. I come from a strong zionist community in the [United States], and became critical of zionism starting in my early twenties.... I am now working for what can only be called a post-zionist vision at this point in history. Perhaps at another point in history, I would be called a zionist, or even call myself that.""[99]
Butler argues that, though antisemitism has been rising, there is a danger that Jews are seen as ""presumptive victims"", leading to widespread misuse of accusations of antisemitism, which may in fact trivialize the accusation's gravity and weight.[103][104]
On September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized teach-in against the 2006 Lebanon War at the University of California, Berkeley.[105] Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany, at the award ceremony. They cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, Butler went on to name several groups that they commended as stronger opponents of ""homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism"".[106]
In October 2011, Butler attended Occupy Wall Street and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters' demands, they said:

People have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.[107]

Achille Mbembe, Wendy Brown, Judith Butler, and David Theo-Goldberg in 2016
Butler is an executive member of Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace – Educational Network for Human Rights in Israel/Palestine.[108] They are also a member of the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace.[108] In mainstream U.S. politics, they expressed support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.[109]

Adorno Prize affair[edit]
Butler receives the Theodor W. Adorno Award in 2012
When Butler received the 2012 Theodor W. Adorno Award, the prize committee came under attack from Israel's Ambassador to Germany, Yacov Hadas-Handelsman; the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Jerusalem, Efraim Zuroff;[110] and the German Central Council of Jews. They were upset at Butler's selection because of their remarks about Israel, and specifically, ""calls for a boycott against Israel"".[111] Butler responded saying that ""[Butler] did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally"".[112] Rather, they wrote, the attacks are ""directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies.""[112]
In a letter to the Mondoweiss website, Butler wrote that their strong ethical views were grounded in Jewish philosophical thought and that it is ""blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating"".[108]

Comments on Hamas, Hezbollah and the Israel–Hamas war[edit]
Butler has been criticized for statements they have made about Hamas and Hezbollah. Butler was accused of describing the militant Islamist groups as ""social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left"" in 2012.[113] They were accused of defending ""Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations"" and supporting their tactics.[114][115]
Butler responded to these criticisms by stating that their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, their established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented. Butler describes the origin of their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way:

I was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to ""the global left"" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.[108]
After the start of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Butler published an essay entitled ""The Compass of Mourning"" in which they ""condemn without qualification"" the ""terrifying and revolting massacre"" while at the same time arguing that the attacks by Hamas should be seen in the context of the ""horrors of the last seventy years"".[116] The article was criticized several times in German newspapers. Christian Geyer-Hindemith wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that Butler ""makes individual atrocities disappear"" through contextualization. Thomas E. Schmidt spoke in the Die Zeit about the ""reversal of guilt"". At the same time, Anna Mayr wrote in the Die Zeit that ""countless the same thing goes on for paragraphs: Nothing can justify the violence, and you still have to see the violence of the occupying power, Israel. It becomes clear that [they] (understandably) doesn't know where to think next.""[117][118][119] Writing for Haaretz, Chaim Levinson rejected Butler's framing of the matter within a context of colonialism, saying that term is ""the emptiest word in Western intellectual discourse today"".[120]
Speaking at a public event in Paris on March 3, 2024, Butler stated that the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel was an uprising, an instance of armed resistance, rather than an act of terrorism.[121][122]

""I think it is more honest and historically correct to say that the uprising of October 7 was an act of armed resistance. It is not a terrorist attack and it is not an antisemitic attack. It was an attack against Israelis.""[123]
Comments on Black Lives Matter[edit]
In a January 2015 interview with George Yancy of The New York Times, Butler discussed the Black Lives Matter movement. They said:

What is implied by this statement [Black Lives Matter], a statement that should be obviously true, but apparently is not? If black lives do not matter, then they are not really regarded as lives, since a life is supposed to matter. So what we see is that some lives matter more than others, that some lives matter so much that they need to be protected at all costs, and that other lives matter less, or not at all. And when that becomes the situation, then the lives that do not matter so much, or do not matter at all, can be killed or lost, can be exposed to conditions of destitution, and there is no concern, or even worse, that is regarded as the way it is supposed to be...When people engage in concerted actions across racial lines to build communities based on equality, to defend the rights of those who are disproportionately imperiled to have a chance to live without the fear of dying quite suddenly at the hands of the police. There are many ways to do this, in the street, the office, the home, and in the media. Only through such an ever-growing cross-racial struggle against racism can we begin to achieve a sense of all the lives that really do matter.
The dialogue draws heavily on their 2004 book Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence.[124]

Avital Ronell sexual harassment case[edit]
On May 11, 2018, Butler joined a group of scholars in writing a letter to New York University following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor Avital Ronell. The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the Title IX complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a ""malicious campaign"" against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed ""malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare"" for a highly regarded scholar. ""If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed.""[125] Butler, one of the signatories, invoked their title as President Elect of the Modern Language Association. James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler's resignation or removal from their post. He argued that ""Protesting against one instance of punishment is only a means to the larger end of preserving senior faculty's privilege of impunity. ... [Butler] was standing up for an old, corrupt, and long-standing way of doing business. The time for doing business that way is over. We should never look back.""[126] Some three months later, Butler apologized to the MLA for the letter. ""I acknowledged that I should not have allowed the MLA affiliation to go forward with my name,"" Butler wrote to the Chronicle of Higher Education. ""I expressed regret to the MLA officers and staff, and my colleagues accepted my apology. I extend that same apology to MLA members.""[127]

Comments on the anti-gender movement and trans-exclusionary radical feminism[edit]
Sign at São Paulo with Judith Butler's name. ""destruir identidade sexual dos seus filhos"" can be loosely translated as destroy sexual identity of your children
Butler said in 2020 that trans-exclusionary radical feminism (TERF) is ""a fringe movement that is seeking to speak in the name of the mainstream, and that our responsibility is to refuse to let that happen"".[128] In 2021, drawing from Umberto Eco who understood ""fascism"" as ""a beehive of contradictions"",[d] they noted that the term fascism ""describes"" the ""anti-gender ideology"". They cautioned self-declared feminists from allying with anti-gender movements in targeting trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people.[92][129] Butler also explored the issue in a 2019 paper in which they argued that ""the confusion of discourses is part of what constitutes the fascist structure and appeal of at least some of these [anti-gender] movements. One can oppose gender as a cultural import from the North at the same time that one can see that very opposition as a social movement against further colonization of the South. The result is not a turn to the Left, but an embrace of ethno-nationalism.""[130] In 2023 Butler said, ""the anti-gender ideology movement should be considered a neo-fascist phenomenon.""[131]

The Guardian interview[edit]
On September 7, 2021, The Guardian published an interview[94] with Butler by Jules Gleeson that included Butler's view of trans-exclusionary feminists (TERFs). In response to a question about the Wi Spa controversy, the Press Gazette stated that Butler, in the Guardian article, said: ""The anti-gender ideology is one of the dominant strains of fascism in our times.""[132] Within a few hours of publication, three paragraphs including this statement were removed, with a note explaining: ""This article was edited on 7 September 2021 to reflect developments which occurred after the interview took place.""[133]
The Guardian was then accused of censoring Butler for having compared TERFs to fascists. British writer Roz Kaveney called it ""a truly shocking moment of bigoted dishonesty,"" while British transgender activist and writer Juno Dawson, among others, observed that The Guardian had inadvertently triggered the Streisand effect—an attempt to censor yields the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of a topic.[134] The next day, The Guardian acknowledged ""a failure in our editorial standards"".[133]

Personal life[edit]
Butler is a lesbian,[135] legally non-binary in the State of California,[136] and, as of 2020, said they use both singular they/them and she/her pronouns but prefer to use singular they/them pronouns.[6] Butler indicated that they were ""never at home"" with being assigned female at birth.[5]
They live in Berkeley with their partner Wendy Brown and son.[137]

Notes[edit]


^ Butler uses she/her and they/them pronouns[5] but in 2020 said that they prefer the latter.[6] This article uses they/them pronouns for consistency.

^ Butler's cited entry in a 1997 issue of the scholarly journal Diacritics ran thus:The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.

^ He criticised it for ""vagueness, inaccuracies, misunderstandings, and plain errors"", such as an ""extraordinarily inaccurate account of Saussure's notion of the sign"", doing Derrida and original preface-writer Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak ""a real disservice"".[90]

^ Butler notes a 'contradiction': ... chromosomal and endocrinological differences complicate the binarism [sic] of sex ... [Nevertheless,] [t]he anti-gender advocates claim that ""gender ideologists"" deny the material differences between men and women, but their [the anti-gender advocates'] materialism quickly devolves ... .[92]

While Butler's theory was initially viewed by some as a kind of gender voluntarism, it is clear that this is very far from her actual view, further refined in Bodies that Matter (1993). Butler clarifies that instead of a kind of voluntary theatricality donned and doffed by a pre-existing agent, gender performance is constitutive of the agent itself.

I will proceed backwards, from present to past, from critiques and interpretations to Beauvoir's own writing. My starting point is the recent criticism presented by Judith Butler in her Gender Trouble (1990a). In this work, Butler contrasts her own ""performative theory of gender"" to Beauvoir's ...... the notion that Butler presented a voluntarist theory of gender. ...

Butler's theory of performative gender has been criticized for being a voluntarist theory. Elspeth Probyn, for example, takes Butler as saying that gender construction is a totally voluntary act. Hence, Probyn argues that according to Butler's theory of gender performativity 'we can have whatever type of gender we want' ... Butler herself does not criticize Beauvoir for ... a voluntaristic framework ... [Butler] mentions Michele Le Doeuff and other feminists who accuse of Beauvoir for resurrecting 'a classical form of voluntarism which insidiously blames the victims of oppression for 'choosing' their situation'.

What is Ferrocene?,"Ferrocene is a complex organic molecule composed of two Fe atoms and five cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings. It was first synthesized in 1959 by the German chemist Fritz London and his team at the Ruhrchemie company in Essen, Germany. Here are some specific details and examples related to Ferrocene:

* Name: Ferrocene is also known as ferrocenium or FeCp5.
* Discovery: London and his team discovered Ferrocene in 1959 while synthesizing a different compound called ferrocenethiol.
* Synthesis: Ferrocene can be synthesized by the reaction of iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) with a Cp* ligand, which is a derivative of the cyclopentadienyl ring. The Cp* ligand is a highly reactive species that can coordinate with the iron atoms in the iron pentacarbonyl molecule.
* Properties: Ferrocene has a unique combination of properties that make it useful in various applications. Some of its key properties include:
	+ Magnetic properties: Ferrocene has a high magnetic moment, which makes it useful in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other magnetic applications.
	+ Electrochemistry: Ferrocene is an excellent electron transfer agent, which means it can easily transfer electrons between different molecules or electrodes.
	+ Catalysis: Ferrocene has been used as a catalyst in various chemical reactions, including the oxidation of alcohols and the reduction of nitro compounds.
* Applications: Ferrocene has a wide range of applications due to its unique properties. Some of its key applications include:
	+ Electrochemistry: Ferrocene is used as an electrode in batteries, fuel cells, and other electrochemical devices.
	+ Catalysis: Ferrocene is used as a catalyst in various chemical reactions, including the oxidation of alcohols and the reduction of nitro compounds.
	+ Magnetism: Ferrocene is used in MRI imaging to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and improve the spatial resolution of the images.
* People: Fritz London and his team at Ruhrchemie were responsible for the discovery and synthesis of Ferrocene. Other notable people associated with Ferrocene include:
	+ Fritz London: The German chemist who synthesized Ferrocene in 1959.
	+ Peter Atkins: A British chemist who wrote a popular textbook on physical chemistry, which includes a chapter on Ferrocene.
	+ Tony Blighe: An Irish chemist who developed a process for the commercial production of Ferrocene.
* Numbers: Ferrocene has a molecular formula of C10H14Fe, which means it contains 10 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and one iron atom.
* Events: Ferrocene was first synthesized in 1959 by the German chemist Fritz London and his team at the Ruhrchemie company in Essen, Germany. The discovery of Ferrocene was a significant achievement in the field of organic chemistry and has led to its widespread use in various applications.

Chemical compound
Ferrocene is an organometallic compound with the formula Fe(C5H5)2. The molecule is a complex consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings sandwiching a central iron atom. It is an orange solid with a camphor-like odor that sublimes above room temperature, and is soluble in most organic solvents. It is remarkable for its stability: it is unaffected by air, water, strong bases, and can be heated to 400 °C without decomposition. In oxidizing conditions it can reversibly react with strong acids to form the ferrocenium cation Fe(C5H5)+2.[7] Ferrocene and the ferrocenium cation are sometimes abbreviated as Fc and Fc+ respectively.
The first reported synthesis of ferrocene was in 1951. Its unusual stability puzzled chemists, and required the development of new theory to explain its formation and bonding. The discovery of ferrocene and its many analogues, known as metallocenes, sparked excitement and led to a rapid growth in the discipline of organometallic chemistry. Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer, both of whom worked on elucidating the structure of ferrocene, later shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on organometallic sandwich compounds. Ferrocene itself has no large-scale applications, but has found more niche uses in catalysis, as a fuel additive, and as a tool in undergraduate education.


History[edit]
Discovery[edit]
Ferrocene was discovered by accident twice. The first known synthesis may have been made in the late 1940s by unknown researchers at Union Carbide, who tried to pass hot cyclopentadiene vapor through an iron pipe. The vapor reacted with the pipe wall, creating a ""yellow sludge"" that clogged the pipe. Years later, a sample of the sludge that had been saved was obtained and analyzed by Eugene O. Brimm, shortly after reading Kealy and Pauson's article, and was found to consist of ferrocene.[7][8]
The second time was around 1950, when Samuel A. Miller, John A. Tebboth, and John F. Tremaine, researchers at British Oxygen, were attempting to synthesize amines from hydrocarbons and nitrogen in a modification of the Haber process. When they tried to react cyclopentadiene with nitrogen at 300 °C, at atmospheric pressure, they were disappointed to see the hydrocarbon react with some source of iron, yielding ferrocene. While they too observed its remarkable stability, they put the observation aside and did not publish it until after Pauson reported his findings.[7][9][10] Kealy and Pauson were later provided with a sample by Miller et al., who confirmed that the products were the same compound.[8]
In 1951, Peter L. Pauson and Thomas J. Kealy at Duquesne University attempted to prepare fulvalene ((C5H4)2) by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene (C5H6). To that end, they reacted the Grignard compound cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether with ferric chloride as an oxidizer.[7] However, instead of the expected fulvalene, they obtained a light orange powder of ""remarkable stability"", with the formula C10H10Fe.[8][11]

Determining the structure[edit]
Pauson and Kealy's original (incorrect) notion of ferrocene's molecular structure.[11]
Pauson and Kealy conjectured that the compound had two cyclopentadienyl groups, each with a single covalent bond from the saturated carbon atom to the iron atom.[7] However, that structure was inconsistent with then-existing bonding models and did not explain the unexpected stability of the compound, and chemists struggled to find the correct structure.[10][12]
The structure was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952.[13] Robert Burns Woodward, Geoffrey Wilkinson, et al. deduced observe that the compound was diamagnetic and nonpolar.[14]  A few months later they described its reactions as being typical of aromatic compounds such as benzene.[15] The name ferrocene was coined by Mark Whiting, a postdoc with Woodward.[16] Ernst Otto Fischer and Wolfgang Pfab also noted ferrocene's diamagneticity and high symmetry. They also synthesize nickelocene and cobaltocene and confirmed they had the same structure.[17] Fischer described the structure as Doppelkegelstruktur (""double-cone structure""), although the term ""sandwich"" came to be preferred by British and American chemists.[18] Philip Frank Eiland and Raymond Pepinsky confirmed the structure through X-ray crystallography and later by NMR spectroscopy.[10][19][20][21]
The ""sandwich"" structure of ferrocene was shockingly novel and led to intensive theoretical studies. Application of molecular orbital theory with the assumption of a Fe2+ centre between two cyclopentadienide anions C5H−5 resulted in the successful Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model, allowing correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule as well as explaining its remarkable stability.[22][23]

Impact[edit]
The discovery of ferrocene was considered so significant that Wilkinson and Fischer shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ""for their pioneering work, performed independently, on the chemistry of the organometallic, called sandwich compounds"".[24]

Structure and bonding[edit]
Mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that the iron center in ferrocene should be assigned the +2 oxidation state. Each cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ring should then be allocated a single negative charge. Thus ferrocene could be described as iron(II) bis(cyclopentadienide), Fe2+[C5H−5]2.
Each ring has six π-electrons, which makes them aromatic according to Hückel's rule. These π-electrons are then shared with the metal via covalent bonding. Since Fe2+ has six d-electrons, the complex attains an 18-electron configuration, which accounts for its stability. In modern notation, this sandwich structural model of the ferrocene molecule is denoted as Fe(η5-C5H5)2, where η denotes hapticity, the number of atoms through which each ring binds.
The carbon–carbon bond distances around each five-membered ring are all 1.40 Å, and all Fe–C bond distances are 2.04 Å. The Cp rings rotate with a low barrier about the Cp(centroid)–Fe–Cp(centroid) axis, as observed by measurements on substituted derivatives of ferrocene using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For example, methylferrocene (CH3C5H4FeC5H5) exhibits a singlet for the C5H5 ring.[25]
From room temperature down to 164 K, X-ray crystallography yields the monoclinic space group; the cyclopentadienide rings are a staggered conformation, resulting in a centrosymmetric molecule, with symmetry group D5d.[19] However, below 110 K, ferrocene crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal lattice in which the Cp rings are ordered and eclipsed, so that the molecule has symmetry group D5h.[26] In the gas phase, electron diffraction[27] and computational studies[28] show that the Cp rings are eclipsed. While ferrocene has no permanent dipole moment at room temperature, between 172.8 and 163.5 K the molecule exhibits an ""incommensurate modulation"", breaking the D5 symmetry and acquiring an electric dipole.[29]
In solution, eclipsed D5h ferrocene was determined to dominate over the staggered D5d conformer, as suggested by both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculations.[30]

Synthesis[edit]
Early methods[edit]
The first reported syntheses of ferrocene were nearly simultaneous. Pauson and Kealy synthesised ferrocene using iron(III) chloride and cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide.[11] A redox reaction produces iron(II) chloride. The formation of fulvalene, the intended outcome does not occur.[8]


The Miller et al.[9] approach to ferrocene
Another early synthesis of ferrocene was by Miller et al.,[9] who treated metallic iron with gaseous cyclopentadiene at elevated temperature.[31] An approach using iron pentacarbonyl was also reported.[32]

Fe(CO)5 + 2 C5H6 → Fe(C5H5)2 + 5 CO + H2
Via alkali cyclopentadienide[edit]
More efficient preparative methods are generally a modification of the original transmetalation sequence using either commercially available sodium cyclopentadienide[33] or freshly cracked cyclopentadiene deprotonated with potassium hydroxide[34] and reacted with anhydrous iron(II) chloride in ethereal solvents.
Modern modifications of Pauson and Kealy's original Grignard approach are known:

Using sodium cyclopentadienide:       2 NaC5H5   +   FeCl2   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 NaCl
Using freshly-cracked cyclopentadiene:     FeCl2·4H2O   +   2 C5H6   +   2 KOH   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 KCl   +   6 H2O
Using an iron(II) salt with a Grignard reagent:     2 C5H5MgBr   +   FeCl2   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 MgBrCl
Even some amine bases (such as diethylamine) can be used for the deprotonation, though the reaction proceeds more slowly than when using stronger bases:[33]

2 C5H6   +   2 (CH3CH2)2NH   +   FeCl2   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 (CH3CH2)2NH2Cl
Direct transmetalation can also be used to prepare ferrocene from some other metallocenes, such as manganocene:[35]

FeCl2   +   Mn(C5H5)2   →   MnCl2   +   Fe(C5H5)2
Properties[edit]
Crystals of ferrocene after purification by vacuum sublimation
Ferrocene is an air-stable orange solid with a camphor-like odor.[36]    As expected for a symmetric, uncharged species, ferrocene is soluble in normal organic solvents, such as benzene, but is insoluble in water. It is stable to temperatures as high as 400 °C.[36]
Ferrocene readily sublimes, especially upon heating in a vacuum. Its vapor pressure is about 1 Pa at 25 °C, 10 Pa at 50 °C, 100 Pa at 80 °C, 1000 Pa at 116 °C, and 10,000 Pa (nearly 0.1 atm) at 162 °C.[37][38]

Reactions[edit]
With electrophiles[edit]
Ferrocene undergoes many reactions characteristic of aromatic compounds, enabling the preparation of substituted derivatives. A common undergraduate experiment is the Friedel–Crafts reaction of ferrocene with acetic anhydride (or acetyl chloride) in the presence of phosphoric acid as a catalyst. Under conditions for a Mannich reaction, ferrocene gives N,N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene.

Important reactions of ferrocene with electrophiles and other reagents
Ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the ferrocenium cation (Fc+); the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry.[12]
It is an aromatic substance and undergoes substitution reactions rather than addition reactions on the cyclopentadienyl ligands. For example, Friedel-Crafts acylation of ferrocene with acetic anhydride yields acetylferrocene[39] just as acylation of benzene yields acetophenone under similar conditions. Vilsmeier-Haack reaction (formylation) using formylanilide and phosphorus oxychloride gives ferrocenecarboxaldehyde.  Diformylation does not occur readily, showing the electronic communication between the two rings.[40]
Protonation of ferrocene allows isolation of [Cp2FeH]PF6.[41]
In the presence of aluminium chloride, Me2NPCl2 and ferrocene react to give ferrocenyl dichlorophosphine,[42] whereas treatment with phenyldichlorophosphine under similar conditions forms P,P-diferrocenyl-P-phenyl phosphine.[43]
Ferrocene reacts with P4S10 forms a diferrocenyl-dithiadiphosphetane disulfide.[44]

Lithiation[edit]
Ferrocene reacts with butyllithium to give 1,1′-dilithioferrocene, which is a versatile nucleophile. In combination with butyllithiium, tert-butyllithium produces monolithioferrocene.[45]

Redox chemistry[edit]
Ferrocene undergoes a one-electron oxidation at around 0.4 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), becoming ferrocenium. This reversible oxidation has been used as standard in electrochemistry as Fc+/Fc = 0.64 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode,[46] however other values have been reported.[47] Ferrocenium tetrafluoroborate is a common reagent.[48] The remarkably reversible oxidation-reduction behaviour has been extensively used to control electron-transfer processes in electrochemical[49][50] and photochemical[51][52] systems. 

The one-electron oxidized derivative of biferrocene has attracted much research attention.
Substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands alters the redox potential in the expected way: electron-withdrawing groups such as a carboxylic acid shift the potential in the anodic direction (i.e. made more positive), whereas electron-releasing groups such as methyl groups shift the potential in the cathodic direction (more negative). Thus, decamethylferrocene is much more easily oxidised than ferrocene and can even be oxidised to the corresponding dication.[53] Ferrocene is often used as an internal standard for calibrating redox potentials in non-aqueous electrochemistry.

Stereochemistry of substituted ferrocenes[edit]
A planar chiral ferrocene derivative
Disubstituted ferrocenes can exist as either 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,1′- isomers, none of which are interconvertible. Ferrocenes that are asymmetrically disubstituted on one ring are chiral – for example [CpFe(EtC5H3Me)]. This planar chirality arises despite no single atom being a stereogenic centre. The substituted ferrocene shown at right (a 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine derivative) has been shown to be effective when used for the kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols.[54]
Several approaches have been developed to asymmetrically 1,1′-functionalise the ferrocene.[55]

Applications of ferrocene and its derivatives[edit]
Ferrocene and its numerous derivatives have no large-scale applications, but have many niche uses that exploit the unusual structure (ligand scaffolds, pharmaceutical candidates), robustness (anti-knock formulations, precursors to materials), and redox (reagents and redox standards).

Ligand scaffolds[edit]
Chiral ferrocenyl phosphines are employed as ligands for transition-metal catalyzed reactions. Some of them have found industrial applications in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. For example, the diphosphine 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) is a valued ligand for palladium-coupling reactions and Josiphos ligand is useful for hydrogenation catalysis.[56] They are named after the technician who made the first one, Josi Puleo.[57][58]

Josiphos ligand.[56]
Fuel additives[edit]
Ferrocene and its derivatives are antiknock agents used in the fuel for petrol engines. They are safer than previously used tetraethyllead.[59] Petrol additive solutions containing ferrocene can be added to unleaded petrol to enable its use in vintage cars designed to run on leaded petrol.[60] The iron-containing deposits formed from ferrocene can form a conductive coating on spark plug surfaces. Ferrocene polyglycol copolymers, prepared by effecting a polycondensation reaction between a ferrocene derivative and a substituted dihydroxy alcohol, has promise as a component of rocket propellants. These copolymers provide rocket propellants with heat stability, serving as a propellant binder and controlling propellant burn rate.[61]
Ferrocene has been found to be effective at reducing smoke and sulfur trioxide produced when burning coal. The addition by any practical means, impregnating the coal or adding ferrocene to the combustion chamber, can significantly reduce the amount of these undesirable byproducts, even with a small amount of the metal cyclopentadienyl compound.[62]

Pharmaceuticals[edit]
Ferrocerone
Ferrocene derivatives have been investigated as drugs,[63] with one compound ferrocerone [ru] approved for use in the USSR in the 1970s as an iron supplement, though it is no longer marketed today.[64] Only one drug has entered clinical trials in recent years, Ferroquine (7-chloro-N-(2-((dimethylamino)methyl)ferrocenyl)quinolin-4-amine), an antimalarial,[65][66][67] which has reached Phase IIb trials.[68] Ferrocene-containing polymer-based drug delivery systems have been investigated.[69]

Ferroquine
The anticancer activity of ferrocene derivatives was first investigated in the late 1970s, when derivatives bearing amine or amide groups were tested against lymphocytic leukemia.[70] Some ferrocenium salts exhibit anticancer activity, but no compound has seen evaluation in the clinic.[71] Ferrocene derivatives have strong inhibitory activity against human lung cancer cell line A549, colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, and breast cancer cell line MCF-7.[72] An experimental drug was reported which is a ferrocenyl version of tamoxifen.[73] The idea is that the tamoxifen will bind to the estrogen binding sites, resulting in cytotoxicity.[73][74]
Ferrocifens are exploited for cancer applications by a French biotech, Feroscan, founded by Pr. Gerard Jaouen.

Solid rocket propellant[edit]
Ferrocene and related derivatives are used as powerful burn rate catalysts in ammonium perchlorate composite propellant.[75]

Derivatives and variations[edit]
Ferrocene analogues can be prepared with variants of cyclopentadienyl. For example, bisindenyliron and bisfluorenyliron.[58]

Various ferrocene derivatives where cyclopentadienyl has been replaced by related ligands
Carbon atoms can be replaced by heteroatoms as illustrated by Fe(η5-C5Me5)(η5-P5) and Fe(η5-C5H5)(η5-C4H4N) (""azaferrocene""). Azaferrocene arises from decarbonylation of Fe(η5-C5H5)(CO)2(η1-pyrrole) in cyclohexane.[76] This compound on boiling under reflux in benzene is converted to ferrocene.[77]
Because of the ease of substitution, many structurally unusual ferrocene derivatives have been prepared. For example, the penta(ferrocenyl)cyclopentadienyl ligand,[78] features a cyclopentadienyl anion derivatized with five ferrocene substituents.

Penta(ferrocenyl)cyclopentadienyl ligand
Structure of hexaferrocenylbenzene
In hexaferrocenylbenzene, C6[(η5-C5H4)Fe(η5-C5H5)]6, all six positions on a benzene molecule have ferrocenyl substituents (R).[79] X-ray diffraction analysis of this compound confirms that the cyclopentadienyl ligands are not co-planar with the benzene core but have alternating dihedral angles of +30° and −80°. Due to steric crowding the ferrocenyls are slightly bent with angles of 177° and have elongated C-Fe bonds. The quaternary cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms are also pyramidalized. Also, the benzene core has a chair conformation with dihedral angles of 14° and displays bond length alternation between 142.7 pm and 141.1 pm, both indications of steric crowding of the substituents.
The synthesis of hexaferrocenylbenzene has been reported using Negishi coupling of hexaiodidobenzene and diferrocenylzinc, using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, in tetrahydrofuran:[79]


The yield is only 4%, which is further evidence consistent with substantial steric crowding around the arene core.


Materials chemistry[edit]
Strands of an uncharged ferrocene-substituted polymer are tethered to a hydrophobic silica surface. Oxidation of the ferrocenyl groups produces a hydrophilic surface due to electrostatic attractions between the resulting charges and the polar solvent.[80]
Ferrocene, a precursor to iron nanoparticles, can be used as a catalyst for the production of carbon nanotubes.[81] Vinylferrocene can be converted to (polyvinylferrocene, PVFc), a ferrocenyl version of polystyrene (the phenyl groups are replaced with ferrocenyl groups). Another polyferrocene which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. In addition to using organic polymer backbones, these pendant ferrocene units have been attached to inorganic backbones such as polysiloxanes, polyphosphazenes, and polyphosphinoboranes, (–PH(R)–BH2–)n, and the resulting materials exhibit unusual physical and electronic properties relating to the ferrocene / ferrocinium redox couple.[80] Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups. The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70° smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30°, and the switching of wettability is reversible. In the PFcMA case, the effect of lengthening the chains and hence introducing more ferrocene groups is significantly larger reductions in the contact angle upon oxidation.[80][82]

"
Who was Grigori Rasputin?,"Grigori Rasputin was a Russian mystic and spiritual leader who played a significant role in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Revolution. Here are some specific details and examples of his life and influence:

* Grigori Rasputin was born in the small village of Polotsk, Russia, in 1869. He was the son of a wealthy landowner and was educated at a prestigious military school.
* Rasputin gained notoriety in the 1900s as a holy man and healer, who was said to have the ability to heal the sick and the afflicted. He was also known for his mystical practices, such as praying to the Virgin Mary and performing séances.
* In 1903, Rasputin married the daughter of a wealthy landowner and became involved in Russian politics and society. He was known for his charm and charisma, and was able to ingratiate himself with influential people, including the Russian Tsar Nicholas II.
* Rasputin's influence on Russian politics and society grew over time, and he became known as a spiritual advisor to the Tsar and his family. He was able to influence the Tsar's decisions and was able to bring about a number of changes in Russian society, including the legalization of gambling and the loosening of restrictions on women's dress.
* However, Rasputin's influence also brought about a number of problems, including accusations of corruption and immorality. In 1916, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Russian government, but was eventually released.
* In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out, and Rasputin was able to use his influence to try to influence the new government. However, he was assassinated in December of that year by a group of revolutionaries, who believed that he was a threat to the new government.
* Grigori Rasputin's legacy continues to be debated and discussed in Russia and beyond. While some people view him as a spiritual and political leader, others view him as a manipulative and immoral figure who played a role in the downfall of the Russian Empire.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin,"

Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (/ræˈspjuːtɪn/; Russian: Григо́рий Ефи́мович Распу́тин [ɡrʲɪˈɡorʲɪj jɪˈfʲiməvʲɪtɕ rɐˈsputʲɪn]; 21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869 –  30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916) was a Russian mystic and faith healer. He is best known for having befriended the imperial family of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, through whom he gained considerable influence in the final years of the Russian Empire.
Rasputin was born to a family of peasants in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, located within Tyumensky Uyezd in Tobolsk Governorate (present-day Yarkovsky District in Tyumen Oblast). He had a religious conversion experience after embarking on a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897 and has been described as a monk or as a strannik (wanderer or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1903 or in the winter of 1904–1905, he travelled to Saint Petersburg and captivated a number of religious and social leaders, eventually becoming a prominent figure in Russian society. In November 1905, Rasputin met Nicholas II and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna.
In late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a faith healer for Nicholas' and Alexandra's only son, Alexei Nikolaevich, who suffered from haemophilia. He was a divisive figure at court, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary and prophet, and by others as a religious charlatan. The extent of Rasputin's power reached an all-time high in 1915, when Nicholas left Saint Petersburg to oversee the Imperial Russian Army as it was engaged in the First World War. In his absence, Rasputin and Alexandra consolidated their influence across the Russian Empire. However, as Russian military defeats mounted on the Eastern Front, both figures became increasingly unpopular, and in the early morning of 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916, Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative Russian noblemen who opposed his influence over the imperial family.
Historians often suggest that Rasputin's scandalous and sinister reputation helped discredit the Tsarist government, thus precipitating the overthrow of the House of Romanov shortly after his assassination. Accounts of his life and influence were often based on common rumors; he remains a mysterious and captivating figure in popular culture.[1]


Early life
Pokrovskoye in 1912
Rasputin with his children
Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk Governorate (now Tyumen Oblast) in the Russian Empire.[2] According to official records, he was born on 21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869 and christened the following day.[3] He was named for St. Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on 10 January.[4]
There are few records of Rasputin's parents. His father, Yefim (1842 – 1916),[4] was a peasant farmer and church elder who had been born in Pokrovskoye and married Rasputin's mother, Anna Parshukova (c. 1840 – 1906), in 1863. Yefim also worked as a government courier, ferrying people and goods between Tobolsk and Tyumen.[5][4] The couple had seven other children, all of whom died in infancy and early childhood; there may have been a ninth child, Feodosiya. According to historian Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin was certainly close to Feodosiya and was godfather to her children, but ""the records that have survived do not permit us to say more than that"".[5]
According to historian Douglas Smith, Rasputin's youth and early adulthood are ""a black hole about which we know almost nothing"", though the lack of reliable sources and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about Rasputin's parents and his youth after his rise to prominence.[6] Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was not formally educated and remained illiterate well into his early adulthood.[4][7] Local archival records suggest that he had a somewhat unruly youth—possibly involving drinking, small thefts and disrespect for local authorities—but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy or bearing false witness, all major crimes later imputed to him as a young man.[8]
In 1886, Rasputin traveled to Abalak, some 250 km east-northeast of Tyumen and 2,800 km east of Moscow, where he met a peasant girl named Praskovya Dubrovina. After a courtship of several months, they married in February 1887. Praskovya remained in Pokrovskoye throughout Rasputin's later travels and rise to prominence, and remained devoted to him until his death. The couple had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood: Dmitry (b. 1895), Maria (b. 1898) and Varvara (b. 1900).[9]

Religious conversion
In 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons are unclear; according to some sources, he left the village to escape punishment for his role in horse theft.[10] Other sources suggest Rasputin had a vision of the Virgin Mary or of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye, while still others suggest that his pilgrimage was inspired by a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky.[11] Whatever his reasons, Rasputin cast off his old life: he was 28 years old, married ten years, with an infant son and another child on the way. According to Smith, his decision ""could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis"".[12]
Rasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk's cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 transformed him.[13] There, he met and was ""profoundly humbled"" by a starets (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write. However, he later claimed that some of the monks at Verkhotuyre engaged in homosexuality and criticized monastic life as too coercive.[14] He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently. He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past.[15]
Rasputin spent the years that followed as a strannik (a holy wanderer or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of holy sites.[16] It is possible he wandered as far as Mount Athos—the center of Eastern Orthodox monastic life—in 1900.[17]
By the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of followers, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Yefim's root cellar—Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time—the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing Rasputin before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs, and even that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to include self-flagellation and sexual orgies.[18][19] According to Fuhrmann, however, ""repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect"", and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded.[20]

Rise to prominence

Word of Rasputin's activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s.[18] At some point during 1904 or 1905, he traveled to the city of Kazan, where he acquired a reputation as a wise starets who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties.[21] Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with female followers,[22] he made a favorable impression on several local religious leaders. Among these were Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave Rasputin a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the theological seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to Saint Petersburg.[23][24][25]
Upon arriving at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, Rasputin was introduced to church leaders, including Archimandrite Theofan, inspector of the theological seminary, who was well-connected in Saint Petersburg society and later served as confessor to the imperial family.[26][27] Theofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home; he went on to become one of Rasputin's most important friends in Saint Petersburg,[26] gaining him entry to many of the influential salons where the local aristocracy gathered for religious discussions. It was through these meetings that Rasputin attracted some of his early and influential followers—many of whom would later turn against him.[28]
Alternative religious movements such as spiritualism and theosophy had become popular among Saint Petersburg's aristocracy before Rasputin's arrival, and many of the aristocracy were intensely curious about the occult and the supernatural.[29] Rasputin's ideas and ""strange manners"" made him the subject of intense curiosity among the city's elite, who according to Fuhrmann were ""bored, cynical, and seeking new experiences"" during this period.[26] Rasputin's appeal may have been enhanced by the fact that he was also a native Russian, unlike other self-described ""holy men"" such as Nizier Anthelme Philippe and Gérard Encausse, who had previously been popular in Saint Petersburg.[27]
According to Fuhrmann, Rasputin stayed in Saint Petersburg for only a few months on his first visit and returned to Pokrovskoye in the fall of 1903.[30] Smith, however, argues that it is impossible to know whether Rasputin stayed in Saint Petersburg or returned to Pokrovskoye at some point between his first arrival and 1905.[31] Regardless, by 1905 Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the ""Black Princesses"", Militsa and Anastasia of Montenegro, who had married cousins of Tsar Nicholas II (Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich and Prince George Maximilianovich Romanowsky) and were instrumental in introducing Rasputin to the tsar and his family.[27][32]
Rasputin first met Nicholas on 1 November 1905, at the Peterhof Palace. The tsar recorded the event in his diary, writing that he and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, had ""made the acquaintance of a man of God – Grigory, from Tobolsk province"".[31] Rasputin returned to Pokrovskoye shortly after their first meeting and did not return to Saint Petersburg until July 1906.[33] On his return, he sent Nicholas a telegram asking to present the tsar with an icon of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye. He met with Nicholas and Alexandra on 18 July and again in October, when he first met their children.[34]
At some point, Nicholas and Alexandra became convinced that Rasputin possessed the miraculous power to heal their only son, Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, who suffered from haemophilia. Historians disagree over when this happened: according to Orlando Figes, Rasputin was first introduced to the tsar and tsarina as a healer who could help their son in November 1905,[35] while Joseph T. Fuhrmann has speculated that it was in October 1906 that Rasputin was first asked to pray for the health of Alexei.[36]

Healer to Alexei Nikolaevich

Much of Rasputin's influence with the imperial family stemmed from the belief by Alexandra and others that he had on several occasions eased Alexei's pain and stopped his bleeding. According to historian Marc Ferro, the tsarina had a ""passionate attachment"" to Rasputin, believing he could heal her son's affliction.[37] Harold Shukman wrote that Rasputin became ""an indispensable member of the royal entourage"".[38] It is unclear when Rasputin first learned of Alexei's haemophilia, or when he first acted as a healer. He may have been aware of Alexei's condition as early as October 1906,[36] and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for the tsarevich when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning.[39] Alexandra's friend Anna Vyrubova became convinced that Rasputin had miraculous powers shortly thereafter and became one of his most influential advocates.[40][41]
During the summer of 1912, Alexei developed a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the imperial hunting grounds at Spała, which caused a large hematoma.[42] In severe pain and delirious with fever, the tsarevich appeared close to death.[43] In desperation, Alexandra asked Vyrubova to send Rasputin (who was in Siberia) a telegram, asking him to pray for Alexei.[44] Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the tsarina that ""God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.""[44] The next morning, Alexei's condition was unchanged, but Alexandra was encouraged by the message and regained some hope that he would survive. His bleeding stopped the following day.[44] Dr. S. P. Fedorov, one of the physicians who attended Alexei, admitted that ""the recovery was wholly inexplicable from a medical point of view.""[45] Later, Dr. Fedorov admitted that Alexandra could not be blamed for seeing Rasputin as a miracle man: ""Rasputin would come in, walk up to the patient, look at him, and spit. The bleeding would stop in no time.... How could the empress not trust Rasputin after that?""[46]
Historian Robert K. Massie has called Alexei's recovery ""one of the most mysterious episodes of the whole Rasputin legend"".[44] The cause of his recovery is unclear: Massie speculated that Rasputin's suggestion not to let doctors disturb Alexei had aided his recovery by allowing him to rest and heal, or that his message may have aided Alexei's recovery by calming his mother and reducing the tsarevich's emotional stress.[47] Alexandra believed that Rasputin had performed a miracle, and concluded that he was essential to Alexei's survival.[48] Some writers and historians, such as Ferro, claim that Rasputin stopped Alexei's bleeding on other occasions through hypnosis.[37] Still other historians–including memoirist Pierre Gilliard, Alexei's French-language tutor–have speculated that Rasputin controlled Alexei's bleeding by disallowing the administration of aspirin, then widely used to relieve pain, but unknown as an anti-clotting agent until the 1950s.[49]

Relationship with the Imperial Children
Alexei and his siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as ""our friend"" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, their aunt, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, was escorted to the nursery by Nicholas to meet Rasputin. Maria, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. ""All the children seemed to like him,"" Olga Alexandrovna recalled. ""They were completely at ease with him.""[50]
Rasputin's friendship with the tsar's children was evident in the messages he sent to them. ""My Dear Pearl M!"" Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. ""Tell me how you talked with the sea, with nature! I miss your simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss."" In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, ""My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it's already evening. So it is with the cares of the world.""[51] In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the children a telegram, advising them to, ""Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.""[52]
One of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 when Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns. Tyutcheva wanted Rasputin barred from the nurseries. In response to her complaints, Nicholas asked Rasputin to end his nursery visits. ""I am so afr(aid) that S.I. [Tyutcheva] can speak ... about our friend something bad,"" Maria's twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to her mother on 8 March 1910, after begging Alexandra to forgive her for doing something she did not like. ""I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.""[53] Alexandra eventually had Tyutcheva fired.[54]
Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the imperial family, who were scandalized by the reports, though Rasputin's contacts with the children were by all accounts completely innocent.[55] Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna, was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. Xenia wrote on 15 March 1910 that she could not understand ""...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a khlyst!) He's always there, goes into the nursery, visits Olga and Tatiana while they are getting ready for bed, sits there talking to them and caressing them. They are careful to hide him from Sofia Ivanovna, and the children don't dare talk to her about him. It's all quite unbelievable and beyond understanding.""[53]
Another of the nursery governesses claimed in the spring of 1910 that she was raped by Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova had at first been a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. Alexandra refused to believe Vishnyakova ""and said that everything Rasputin does is holy"". Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but ""they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard."" Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.[56]
It was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only Alexandra but also the four grand duchesses.[57] Rasputin had released ardent letters written to him by the tsarina and the grand duchesses, which circulated throughout society and fueled the rumors. Pornographic cartoons also circulated that depicted Rasputin having sexual relations with the tsarina, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background.[58] Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave Saint Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.[59]
Despite the scandal, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until his murder on 17 December 1916. ""Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed,"" Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916.[60] In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared ""cold and visibly terribly upset"" by Rasputin's death and sat ""huddled up closely together"" on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed.[61] Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by the grand duchesses and their mother.[62]

Controversies
Rasputin among admirers, 1914
The imperial family's belief in Rasputin's healing powers brought him considerable status and power at court.[63] Nicholas appointed Rasputin his lampadnik (lamplighter), charged with keeping the lamps lit before religious icons in the palace, which gained him regular access to the palace and imperial family.[64] By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to ask a special favor of the tsar: that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Noviy (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that Rasputin already had the tsar's favor at that early date.[36] Rasputin used his position to full effect, accepting bribes and sexual favors from admirers[63] and working diligently to expand his influence.
Rasputin soon became a controversial figure; he was accused by his enemies of religious heresy and rape, was suspected of exerting undue political influence over the tsar and was even rumored to be having an affair with the tsarina.[65] Opposition to Rasputin's influence grew within the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1907, the local clergy in Pokrovskoye denounced Rasputin as a heretic, and the Bishop of Tobolsk launched an inquest into his activities, accusing him of ""spreading false, Khlyst-like doctrines"".[66] In Saint Petersburg, Rasputin faced opposition from even more prominent critics, including Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin and the Okhrana, the tsar's secret police.[67] Having ordered an investigation into Rasputin's activities, Stolypin confronted Nicholas but did not succeed in reining in Rasputin's influence or exiling him from Saint Petersburg.[68]
Outside of the royal court, Rasputin preached that physical contact between him and others purified them; he engaged in drunken revels and extramarital affairs with a wide range of women from prostitutes to high-society ladies.[69][70] In 1909, Khioniya Berlatskaya, one of Rasputin's early supporters, accused him of rape. Betlatskaya sought aid from Theofan, who became convinced that Rasputin was a danger to the monarchy.[71] Rumors multiplied that Rasputin had assaulted female followers and behaved inappropriately on visits with the imperial family—and particularly with Nicholas's teenage daughters Olga and Tatiana.[72][73]

During this period the First World War, the dissolution of feudalism and a meddling government bureaucracy all contributed to Russia's rapid economic decline. Many laid the blame on Alexandra and Rasputin. One outspoken member of the Duma, far-right politician Vladimir Purishkevich, stated in November 1916 that he held the tsar's ministers had ""been turned into marionettes, marionettes whose threads have been taken firmly in hand by Rasputin and the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna—the evil genius of Russia and the Tsarina… who has remained a German on the Russian throne and alien to the country and its people"".[74] (The tsarina had been born a German princess.)

Failed assassination attempt
On 12 July [O.S. 29 June] 1914, a 33-year-old peasant woman named Khioniya Guseva attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye.[75] Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear if he would survive.[76] After surgery[77] and some time in a hospital in Tyumen,[78] he recovered.
Guseva was a follower of Iliodor, a former priest who had supported Rasputin before denouncing his sexual escapades and self-aggrandizement in December 1911.[79][80] A radical conservative and anti-semite, Iliodor had been part of a group of establishment figures who had attempted to drive a wedge between Rasputin and the imperial family in 1911. When this effort failed, Iliodor was banished from Saint Petersburg and was ultimately defrocked.[79][81] Guseva claimed to have acted alone, having read about Rasputin in the newspapers and believing him to be a ""false prophet and even an Antichrist"".[82] Both the police and Rasputin, however, believed that Iliodor had instigated the assassination attempt.[79] Iliodor fled the country before he could be questioned, and Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions by reason of insanity.[79]

Death
Felix Yusupov, husband of Princess Irina Aleksandrovna Romanova, the Tsar's niece, 1914
A group of nobles led by Purishkevich, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yusupov decided that Rasputin's influence over Alexandra threatened the Russian Empire. They concocted a plan in December 1916 to kill Rasputin, apparently by luring him to the Yusupovs' Moika Palace.[83][84]

Rasputin was murdered during the early morning on 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916 at the home of Prince Yusupov. He died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead. Little is certain about his death beyond this, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation. According to Smith, ""what really happened at the Yusupov home on 17 December will never be known"".[85] The story that Yusupov recounted in his memoirs, however, has become the most frequently told version of events.[86]

Rasputin's corpse on the ground with a bullet wound visible in his forehead
According to Yusupov's account, Rasputin was invited to his palace shortly after midnight and ushered into the basement. Yusupov offered tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. After initially refusing the cakes, Rasputin began to eat them and, to Yusupov's surprise, appeared unaffected by the poison.[87] Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress.[n 1] At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. He took a revolver from Pavlovich, then returned to the basement and told Rasputin that he had ""better look at the crucifix and say a prayer"", referring to a crucifix in the room, then shot him once in the chest. The conspirators then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night.[88] Upon returning to his palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead.[89] Suddenly, Rasputin leaped up and attacked Yusupov, who freed himself with some effort and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed Yusupov into the palace's courtyard, where he was shot by Purishkevich. He collapsed into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped his body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge and dropped it into the Little Nevka river.[90]
In an unsubstantiated claim, Grand Duchess Tatiana, who was earlier alleged to have been raped by Rasputin, was present at the site of Rasputin's murder, ""disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her"". Maurice Paléologue, the French ambassador to Russia, wrote that Tatiana had supposedly witnessed Rasputin's castration, but he doubted the credibility of the rumor.[91]
In a modern analysis of Rasputin's death, published on the 100th anniversary of the event, Dr Carolyn Harris of the University of Toronto notes that the actual circumstances were apparently less dramatic than Yusupov's account. Rasputin's daughter recorded that her father disliked sweet food and would not have eaten the supposedly poisoned cakes. An autopsy account by the official surgeon involved has no record of poisoning or drowning but simply records death by a single bullet fired into the head at close range.[92]

Aftermath
News of Rasputin's murder spread quickly, even before his body was found. According to Smith, Purishkevich spoke openly about the murder to two soldiers and to a policeman who was investigating reports of shots shortly after the event, but urged them not to tell anyone else.[93] An investigation was launched the next morning.[94] The Stock Exchange Gazette ran a report of Rasputin's death ""after a party in one of the most aristocratic homes in the center of the city"" on the afternoon of 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916.
After two workmen discovered blood on the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot on the ice below, police began searching the area.[95] Rasputin's body was found under the river ice on 1 January (O.S. 19 December) approximately 200 meters downstream from the bridge.[96] Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon, examined the body. Kosorotov's report was lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds (one at close range to the forehead), a slice wound to his left side and other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem.[97] Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned.[98] According to both Smith and Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect.[99][100] Some later accounts claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, but Kosorotov found his genitals intact.[98]
Rasputin was buried on 2 January (O.S. 21 December) at a small church that Vyrubova had been building at Tsarskoye Selo. The funeral was attended only by the imperial family and a few of their intimates. Rasputin's wife, mistress and children were not invited,[101] although his daughters met with the imperial family at Vyrubova's home later that day.[102] The imperial family planned to build a church over Rasputin's grave site.[62] However, his body was exhumed and burned by a detachment of soldiers on the orders of Alexander Kerensky shortly after Nicholas abdicated the throne in March 1917,[101] so that his grave would not become a rallying point for supporters of the old regime.[103]

Prominent children
Maria Rasputin
Rasputin's daughter, Maria Rasputin (born Matryona Rasputina; 1898–1977), emigrated to France after the October Revolution and then to the United States. There, she worked as a dancer and then a lion tamer in a circus.[104]

Notes


^ The claim that Stanislas Lazovert confessed on his deathbed that he applied mock-poison to the wine and pastries instead of cyanide to avoid violating the Hippocratic Oath appears to be incorrect and likely originated with the book The Ochrana: The Russian Secret Police, in which the author merely assumes that Lazovert utilized mock-poison.

"
Who is Elizabeth Loftus?,"Elizabeth Loftus is an American psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of California, Irvine. She is known for her research on memory and suggestibility, particularly in the area of false memories.

Loftus's research has led to several key findings, including the idea that people can easily fabricate memories of past events that never occurred. Loftus and her colleagues conducted a series of experiments in which they showed participants a video of a car accident and then asked them to recall details about the accident. In some of the experiments, the participants were given false information about the details of the accident, such as the speed of the cars involved or the direction of the cars.

Despite the false information, the participants were able to accurately recall many of the details of the accident. Loftus and her colleagues also found that the more detailed the false information was, the more accurate the participants' memories were of the accident.

Loftus's work has been controversial, with some critics arguing that her research has led to misconceptions about memory and suggestibility. However, her findings have also been influential, leading to changes in the way that memory is taught in schools and universities.

Some specific details and examples of Loftus's research include:

* Loftus and her colleagues conducted a series of experiments in which they showed participants a video of a car accident and then asked them to recall details about the accident. In some of the experiments, the participants were given false information about the details of the accident, such as the speed of the cars involved or the direction of the cars. Despite the false information, the participants were able to accurately recall many of the details of the accident.
* Loftus and her colleagues also found that the more detailed the false information was, the more accurate the participants' memories were of the accident. This suggests that people are more likely to remember details of events that are highly detailed and vivid.
* Loftus and her colleagues also conducted experiments in which they showed participants a video of a car accident and then asked them to recall details about the accident. In some of the experiments, the participants were given false information about the details of the accident, such as the speed of the cars involved or the direction of the cars. Despite the false information, the participants were able to accurately recall many of the details of the accident.
* Loftus and her colleagues also conducted experiments in which they asked participants to recall details about a past event, such as a car accident or a medical procedure. In some of the experiments, the participants were given false information about the details of the event, such as the speed of the cars involved or the direction of the cars. Despite the false information, the participants were able to accurately recall many of the details of the event.

Overall, Loftus's research has led to several key findings about memory and suggestibility. Her findings have been influential, leading to changes in the way that memory is taught in schools and universities.",True,https://www.amacad.org/person/elizabeth-f-loftus,"

Professor


Elizabeth F. Loftus



University of California, Irvine




Psychologist; Educator



Area
Social and Behavioral Sciences


Specialty
Psychological Sciences


Elected


2003













Dr. Elizabeth F. Loftus, a professor of psychology and expert researcher on the malleability and reliability of repressed memories, is an instrumental figure in cognitive psychology. Loftus' work has made a huge contribution to psychology and opened a unique and controversial aspect of psychology and memory.Loftus was born in Los Angeles, California on October 16, 1944, to Sidney and Rebecca Fishman. Though planning to become a math teacher, she discovered psychology at UCLA where she received her BA in 1966 in math and psychology. In 1968, she married Geoffrey Loftus and applied to graduate school at Stanford. While at Stanford, she became interested in long term memory. Loftus went on to receive her M.A. in 1967 and her Ph.D in 1970, from Stanford. In 1973, Loftus was offered a position as assistant professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, where her husband was currently employed. She is still presently a psychology professor at the University of Washington. She began her research with investigations of how the mind classifies and remembers information. In the 1970's, she began to reevaluate the direction of her research. In ""Diva of Disclosure"" published in Psychology Today, she stated ""I wanted my work to make a difference in people's lives."" Thus, she began her research on traumatically repressed memories and eyewitness accounts. Loftus suddenly found herself in the midst of sexual abuse stories and defending accused offenders. In 1974, her research thrust her into the courtroom to testify in over 200 trials as an expert witness on the unreliability of eyewitness testimonies based on false memories, which she believed to be triggered, suggested, implanted, or created in the mind. Her trials have included those of mass murderer Ted Bundy and George Franklin. She testifies with the hope of preventing an innocent victim from going to prison and protecting a family's unity.Elizabeth Loftus has appeared on countless talk shows including the Oprah Winfrey Show. She has published 19 books and nearly 200 articles. She remains one of the most sought after psychology speakers and is an important spokesperson for the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF). Loftus' most recent book, ""The Myth of Repressed Memory"" written with her colleague Katherine Ketcham, was published in 1994 by St. Martin's Press. It contains three detailed histories of individuals falsely accused of sexual molestation. It is an attempt to justify innocent people from being prosecuted and families being torn apart based on her explanation of the ""false memory phenomenon."" Loftus is an avid member of several psychological associations and has received numerous grants, fellowships, and awards. She is a member of the American Psychological Association, Western Psychological Association, and the Psychonomic Society. Her most recent award was in 1995 when she received the Distinguished Contribution Award from the American Academy of Forensic Psychology. She attains the highest respect from her colleagues and remains an important figure in this unfolding drama of memories and crime.

"
What is the history behind the construction of the Panama Canal?,"The construction of the Panama Canal was a monumental engineering feat that began in the late 19th century and continued through the early 20th century. It was a project that was driven by a desire to shorten the distance between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and to facilitate the movement of goods and people between the two regions.

The history of the Panama Canal can be traced back to the mid-19th century, when the United States government began to explore the possibility of building a canal across Central America. In 1881, the American engineer and explorer, Ferdinand de Lesseps, proposed building a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, which would allow ships to bypass the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and sail directly from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

De Lesseps' proposal was met with skepticism and opposition, but it was championed by a group of American entrepreneurs who saw the potential economic benefits of a canal. In 1889, the American-owned company, the Panama Transit Company, was formed to explore the feasibility of building a canal in Panama.

The construction of the Panama Canal began in 1904, under the leadership of the American engineer, George W. Goethals. Goethals oversaw the construction of a series of locks and aqueducts that would enable ships to travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific without having to circumnavigate the Americas. The first ships to transit the canal were the SS Ancon and the SS San Francisco, on May 16, 1914.

The construction of the Panama Canal was a massive undertaking that required the involvement of thousands of workers, engineers, and contractors. The project was completed in 1914, and the canal has since become a vital transportation route for ships and goods traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

The Panama Canal has been expanded and modernized several times over the years, most recently in 1998, when the Gatun Locks were opened, allowing larger ships to transit the canal. The canal is now operated by the Panamanian government and is an important source of revenue for the country.

The construction of the Panama Canal was a monumental engineering feat that has had a profound impact on the world's transportation systems. It has shortened the distance between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and has facilitated the movement of goods and people between the two regions. The canal has also created thousands of jobs and has been a source of economic growth for the countries of Central America.",True,https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/panama-canal,"

Building the Panama Canal, 1903–1914

President Theodore Roosevelt oversaw the realization of a
                    long-term United States goal—a trans-isthmian canal. Throughout the 1800s,
                    American and British leaders and businessmen wanted to ship goods quickly and
                    cheaply between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

                        circa 1908. (Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division)

To that end, in 1850 the United States and Great Britain negotiated the
                    Clayton-Bulwer Treaty to rein in rivalry over a proposed canal through the
                    Central American Republic of Nicaragua. The Anglo-American canal, however, never
                    went beyond the planning stages. French attempts to build a canal through Panama
                    (province of Colombia) advanced further. Led by Ferdinand de Lesseps—the builder
                    of the Suez Canal in Egypt—the French began excavating in 1880. Malaria, yellow
                    fever, and other tropical diseases conspired against the de Lesseps campaign and
                    after 9 years and a loss of approximately 20,000 lives, the French attempt went
                    bankrupt. In spite of such setbacks, American interest in a canal continued
                    unabated. The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of 1901 abrogated the earlier Clayton-Bulwer
                    Treaty and licensed the United States to build and manage its own canal.
                    Following heated debate over the location of the proposed canal, on June 19,
                    1902, the U.S. Senate voted in favor of building the canal through Panama.
                    Within 6 months, Secretary of State John Hay signed a
                    treaty with Colombian Foreign Minister Tomás Herrán to build the new canal. The
                    financial terms were unacceptable to Colombia’s congress, and it rejected the
                    offer.
President Roosevelt responded by dispatching U.S. warships to Panama City (on the
                    Pacific) and Colón (on the Atlantic) in support of Panamanian independence.
                    Colombian troops were unable to negotiate the jungles of the Darién Gap and
                    Panama declared independence on November 3, 1903. The newly declared Republic of
                    Panama immediately named Philippe Bunau-Varilla (a French engineer who had been
                    involved in the earlier de Lesseps canal attempt) as Envoy Extraordinary and
                    Minister Plenipotentiary. In his new role, Bunau-Varilla negotiated the
                    Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which provided the United States with a
                    10-mile wide strip of land for the canal, a one-time $10 million payment to
                    Panama, and an annual annuity of $250,000. The United States also agreed to
                    guarantee the independence of Panama. Completed in 1914, the Panama Canal
                    symbolized U.S. technological prowess and economic power. Although U.S. control
                    of the canal eventually became an irritant to U.S.-Panamanian relations, at the
                    time it was heralded as a major foreign policy achievement.

"
What is the Raccoon City incident in Resident Evil?,"The Raccoon City incident is a pivotal event in the Resident Evil series that takes place in the fictional town of Raccoon City, United States. The incident begins in 1998, when the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) sends a team of specialists to investigate a viral outbreak at the city's Spencer Mansion, a private research facility owned by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation.

The team, led by Dr. Charles Ashford, discovers that the facility is being used to develop a new type of biological weapon known as ""T-Virus,"" which has been released into the surrounding area. Ashford's team is quickly overwhelmed by the T-Virus, and Ashford is killed in the initial attack.

The BSAA then deploys a team of special forces, led by the game's protagonist, Chris Redfield, to investigate the outbreak and contain the spread of the T-Virus. The team encounters a variety of zombies and other infected creatures, as well as Umbrella Corporation security forces and military personnel.

The Raccoon City incident is notable for its use of zombies as a central theme, as well as its portrayal of the Umbrella Corporation as a major antagonist in the Resident Evil series. The incident also serves as a turning point in the series, as it marks the beginning of the outbreak of the T-Virus and the establishment of the BSAA as a major player in the fight against bioterrorism.",False,https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Raccoon_City_Destruction_Incident,"

The Raccoon City Destruction Incident was an epidemic predominantly caused by the t-Virus that took place around Arklay County especially in Raccoon City in September 1998. Derived from a series of mysterious incidents and bizarre murder cases months earlier, its main cause was the conflict between Umbrella U.S.A. and virologist William Birkin over the ownership of the G-Virus.

Cannibal Disease[]
Background Info[]
t-Virus is a retrovirus engineered by Umbrella Pharmaceuticals for warfare purposes. The primary sponsor of this research was the U.S. government, which -in a clear violation of The Biological Weapons Convention- had a strong interest in the so-called “B.O.W.s” (Bio-Organic Weapons). 

Zombies[]
A zombie refers to humans or animals that have succumbed to the t-Virus infection (Also known as ""The Cannibal Disease"") They suffer from severe brain and body necrosis caused by high cellular metabolism (a side effect of the t-Virus) this process gives them the “living dead” appearance.

Biology[]
Although zombies are medically dead (no organ functions, except for the brain) they aren't reanimated corpses, the standard t-Virus is unable to re-activate dead cell activity. This makes them (due to necrosis) more in a state of ""Dying"". Due to their metabolism, they suffer from severe hunger and have a carnivorous behavior, always looking for living/recently deceased individuals. 

The Outbreak[]
Preceeding incidents (May-September)[]
The first outbreak in Arklay County occurred at Umbrella facilities in the Arklay Mountains on May 11th, at the Arklay Laboratory, the executive training facility, and a water treatment plant as well as adjacent buildings. The perpetrator was Queen Leech, an intelligent bioweapon developed by the late Dr. James Marcus, which had assimilated a facsimile of Marcus's consciousness and sought revenge on Umbrella and the world for his murder ten years prior.
The mountains had already in a precarious situation for several years, with an abandoned hospital housing contaminated flora since 1993 and the escape of Lisa Trevor into the mansion grounds in 1995.[3] In early 1998, allegations were raised that the river water, a dumping ground for Umbrella, had become polluted beyond legal safety limits.[4] However, the latest contamination was far more dangerous. The Arklay staff were exposed to the t-Virus and, following their slow mental deterioration, allowed the MA-39 bioweapon, Cerberus, to escape containment. This led to a number of strange maulings of campers and hikers in the mountains, along with Zombie attacks on rural households. The mountains were subsequently closed to tourists and the Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S) were brought in to investigate, eventually leading to the destruction of the executive training school and laboratory in July, and a subsequent forest fire which destroyed much of the surrounding area.
Though Umbrella USA had enough influence over the media, businesses and municipal institutions in Raccoon City to avoid being linked to criminal actions, with the fall of the Arklay Laboratory, Umbrella virologist Dr. William Birkin and intelligence agent Albert Wesker had begun planning to defect from the company with their research. Wesker had been planning to leave the company for some time, but feared that escape was impossible with oversight from Oswell E. Spencer and the Umbrella Intelligence Division. Thus, Wesker had established contact with a rival corporation, who bid to help Wesker stage his own ""death"" and earn his freedom, at the price of delivering the combat data for Umbrella's Tyrant project. Having received orders to dispatch the S.T.A.R.S. team to the mansion to recover valuable research, Wesker used the opportunity at hand to make the necessary preparations. However, ultimately his efforts were thwarted due to the combined effort of surviving S.T.A.R.S members: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers and Enrico Marini and Umbrella executive officer Sergei Vladimir. 
Running concurrent with this biological disaster, Birkin accelerated research on both the t-Virus and G-Virus projects at the Underground Lab while undergoing negotiations with the Pentagon to hand his research over to the United States Army when completed, in exchange for witness protection alongside his family.[5] Incineration Disposal Plant P-12A, a treatment plant constructed specifically to process biohazardous waste, became a dumping ground for Umbrella's Underground Lab failed test subjects. The material became too much for the facility to process at once, and the chemicals became diluted enough for the virus to mutate. Despite taking antiretroviral drugs, this mutant strain was able to quickly infect the staff and escaped into the outside world.[6] The ground near the plant was also contaminated, leading to the creation of mutants such as the Grave Digger.[7][excerpt 1] Umbrella's facility near the Raccoon Police Station was contaminated by mid-June, with employee ""Don"" showing symptoms of t-Virus infection.[8] By August 17, there were even reports of monsters appearing within the city itself.[9]
The final weeks leading up to the main outbreak saw a further spike in cases. By September 5, the virus had contaminated a chemical treatment plant near the Raccoon Police Station and the sewer facility. Thomas, a worker employed  at a sewage treatment plant next to the Raccoon Police Stationshowed a delayed infection, and was still capable of non-violent, conscious thought as late as September 12, when his friend R.P.D officer George Scott, also began showing symptoms.[10]
Contamination in the sewer system close to Raccoon General Hospital led to an increasing population of mutant leeches, which were observed by researchers at a private Umbrella lab in the basement rather than actively fought against.[11] While the t-Virus spread in the sewers below, the Raccoon General Hospital itself was seeing a surge in inpatients experiencing symptoms of infection, with reports entering on or before Thursday 10 September, and rapidly increasing on Friday 18 September.[12] The hospital was unable to diagnose the patients with a known illness, but took note of the patients experiencing gangrene, coagulation and uncontrolled aggression.[12] Umbrella HQ had taken notice of the increasing spread of the virus and on Tuesday 15 September had already mobilized the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service.[13]

City-wide Outbreak[]
Immediate cause[]
Umbrella caught wind of Birkin's plans thanks to their own moles within the U.S. military, and an Umbrella Security Service (U.S.S.) task force infiltrated Raccoon City in mid-September. Either through spies or warning from Birkin himself, the Rival Company was also alerted to the ongoing developments and Albert Wesker oversaw an H.C.F. operation into the city intent on evacuating Birkin and his research.[14][15]

Operation[]
On September 23, Hunk and another U.S.S. operator both armed with MP5s confronted Birkin in his P-4 laboratory,  Birkin in an attempt defend himself brandished a handgun. However, as he tried to distance himself from the team he was momentarily distracted by an object falling from a nearby desk. Taking the moment of opportunity a U.S.S. operator opened fire on Birkin, mortally  wounding him.
Hunk took Birkin's briefcase containing vials of both the G-Virus and a modified t-Virus ε strain and made their way into the sewers beneath Raccoon City to rendezvous with their reserve team. Close to death, Birkin, still in possession of a remaining G-virus sample injected himself with it leading him to mutate into a ""G"" creature.
After mutating, G-Birkin began to chase Alpha team, catching up to them in the sewers. Despite their attempts to shoot him these hat little to no affect. After killing them, Birkin broke the briefcase and started consuming the samples containing the G-virus, breaking samples containing the T-virus in the process. Shortly after a curious group of rats started drinking the substance leaking from the broken vials, causing them to becoming infected. The sewer life soon spiraled out of control, with giant rats competing with giant cockroaches.[16] Ultimately, these rats were forced out of the sewers and made their way into the outskirts of the city, where their viral load contaminated Victory Lake, the main drinking reservoir for the city.[17]

    Infected rats begin scouring the streets of Raccoon.  
Afterwards[]
Following the raid, Umbrella's Underground Lab had fallen into chaos with the t-Virus spreading throughout the entire laboratory and dozens of Hunter R bioweapons escaping from area B. By rigging the low-temperature laboratory to affect the entirety of level B4F, Dr. Frost was able to force the Hunters to undergo brumation, freezing them in their tracks. Nonetheless, a minimum of ten researchers had been killed during their release.[18] At some point, a researcher managed to steal a remaining sample of the G-Virus from Birkin's lab in the hopes of profiting off it's sale on the black market.[19] Later that day, the executive branch of Umbrella had learned of Birkin's failed assassination and sent out a warning of the major incident at hand. When Brian Irons, Chief of Police of the Raccoon Police Department, was briefed of the emergency he became hysterical and began preparations to botch police operations.[20] Mayor Michael Warren was also alerted and departed the city immediately, leaving his daughter Katherine in the care of Chief Irons.[21]

The Outbreak[]
September 23rd-24th[]
""There was a disruption earlier at today's football match between the Raccoon Sharks and the Old Court Thunders. Apparently the game was interrupted when an unruly fan got out of control and sparked a riot. The number of injured is not yet known, but more than 50 unruly fans broke the line before the police could take control of the scene...""— A news anchor covers the news of ""rioting"".
     A Horde of Zombies on Main Street(Sept. 23–24)   With the t-Virus now contaminating the drinking water, tens of thousands became infected. Over the following hours, violence in the city dramatically increased. During the day, Annette Birkin had finally made the effort to contact her daughter Sherry, and while not informing her of her father's fate, ordered her to leave her classes at East Raccoon Elementary School immediately and return home until further notice. The situation during the first day was immensely confusing, as the emergency response was stretched thin by many reported cases across the city and Raccoon General Hospital became overwhelmed. Still, many people were able to continue on with their ordinary routine despite the increasing state of emergency. Local media began reporting on the mass violence, most notably among spectators at the Raccoon Sharks football game,[22]
Many people were still unaware of the outbreak by the evening, with the occupants of Jack's Bar only evacuating when the bartender, Will, was mauled by an infected man he assumed to be a drunken customer.[22] During the chaos, all available police units were called out to maintain order, set up roadblocks, and post notices regarding helicopter evacuation points.[23] Perhaps with inside information, police were even ordered to kill civilians refusing to comply with police orders.[24] A number of fires broke out around the city, putting a severe strain on the RFD. On Main Street, a small police unit were ordered to set off explosives near the Raccoon Mall, however with the number of zombies on the street reaching staggering numbers, two of the officers were killed while assembling the detonator. A group of survivors assisted in the efforts and successfully triggered the explosives and a large reinforcement force of officers arrived shortly thereafter.[25]
Based on the information of riots obtained by the Pentagon, On September 24 the President quickly invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807, placing the city and surrounding area under martial law.[26] Firefighters Len and Charlie's attempts to put out a fire at the Apple Inn proved fatal when a malfunctioning boiler exploded, with several of the fire-injured zombies mutating into a colony of Lickers.[27]
On Sept. 24th, Chief Irons made several orders to intentionally weaken the effectiveness of the officers. One of which was to seal all possible escape routes, and another was to empty the weapons locker and store weapons and ammunition in caches throughout the station.[28] Though these orders conceptually sought to improve the defense of the station early on by preventing breaches from multiple directions, this eventually backfired and the inevitable loss of ground to the zombies also meant the loss of these caches, the whereabouts of which became unknown to many officers.

     U.S.S. personnel, including JJ and Dylan Blake, are called in to patrol the roads leading out of Raccoon City.  (Sept. 23–24)   The remainder of the operational and off-duty forces of the Umbrella Security Service were quickly deployed by Umbrella HQ to quarantine the city, albeit with little briefing as to the state of the city or the nature of the t-Virus. The unit succeeded in setting up a roadblock at of the city limits, and was tasked with ensuring the evacuation of government and Umbrella personnel. These units were also given the order to 'shoot to kill' citizens attempting to breach the line.
In the end, these units were unprepared to hold back against waves of zombies that would form as a result of many attempting to flee the city and the mission ended in catastrophic failure.[29]

September 24th[]
""Despite the continued efforts of the Police and National Guard, the chaos has yet to be brought under control. Apparently, a rescue helicopter sent to western Raccoon City with nearly 40 refugees on board has crashed. It is unclear if anyone survived. As of nine o'clock, the city has been quarantined and civilian movement is limited and entry by anyone other than authorized military personnel has been strictly forbidden. All signs point to the situation worsening before it gets better.""— A news anchor covers the desperate situation in Raccoon City.[30]
     The U.S. Army in advance towards the city (Sept. 24)  
On the early hours of September 24, the Pentagon deployed an on-the-ground force to assess the severity of the incident, with the earliest media reports of the disaster stating that they were investigating a radioactive leak in the area. The Army National Guard had already been ordered by the State Governor to help with mass-civilian evacuation efforts in addition the President ordered the United States Army to assist in establishing roadblocks and checkpoints on all major highways and routes out of the city.[25][25]
The CDC announced the establishment of an exclusion zone surrounding the city which soon grew to at least 200 miles.[31][note 1] and had begun working with the RPD and the Raccoon City Fire Department in evacuating civilians. With plans for the evacuations being drawn up as early as the evening of September 23, and the first Chinook taking off from Raccoon Zoo at 10 AM on the 24th.[23] The first destination of evacuees was a nearby makeshift hospital, wherein civilians were thoroughly examined for signs of infection before they could be released.[21][32] A no-fly zone was also established,[21] in which only military, Umbrella, RPD, and RFD helicopters were permitted to fly. While the majority of military forces were focused on evacuation and preventing the escape of mutants, Delta Force was also sent in to confiscate Umbrella's research data. One team, which was originally sent to rescue the Birkins, made their way through Umbrella's private subway in search of Umbrella's Underground Lab but instead found themselves at the industrial zone east of the Circular River. Thanks to spies within the military, Umbrella was made aware of the military's ulterior motives.[21]

     A rescue Chinook crashed on Raccoon Tram Terminal.(Sept. 24)  
Around 9 PM, a Chinook crashed when the refugees transformed into zombies.[30] In response to this, the Pentagon announced it would restrict civilian movement.

September 26th[]
     The Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (UBCS) is deployed into the city. (Sept 26)  On September 26, A Saturday, all remaining Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service operatives not currently stationed in the city were deployed and joined in the offensive, bringing with them four platoons of highly trained guerrillas and ex-Soviet personnel. However, they fared poorly against the zombies, and were soon overrun and massacred.[33] Umbrella's plans, however, were beyond that of helping the civilians. Though the UBCS mercenaries had orders to protect and rescue, they had in fact been deployed with the primary goal of testing the effectiveness of trained soldiers against irregular mutants and escaped B.O.W.s, with Monitors within the taskforce recording this information on company-issued laptops. Taking further advantage of the situation, Umbrella Europe deployed it's Hunter β and Hunter γ B.O.W.s, which were transported into the city by road, as well as a Nemesis-T Type by air,[21] with orders to hunt down any surviving S.T.A.R.S. members to prove its viability as an intelligent and obedient soldier.[21]
Meanwhile, operations at Raccoon General Hospital had come to a complete stop. The hospital, which had already been crowded as a result of the water contamination had quickly begun losing personnel, with many having been killed or being turned into zombies.[12] A group of leeches escaped from the sewers and began to stalk survivors and corpses alike. Because leech saliva contains a peptide that inhibits coagulation, staff attacked by leeches continued to bleed out until they were too tired to resist.[34] The hospital staff had refused to abandon their posts during the outbreak, as they desperately researched to create vaccine for the t-Virus, and even succeeded in capturing several Hunter γs to assist in this research. Though they were ultimately successful, the staff failed to vaccinate themselves in time and were either killed or mutated. Through unknown means, Umbrella was made aware of their t-Virus vaccine, and ""Directive Bravo 16"" gave orders for their Monitors to destroy the hospital.[35]

September 27th[]
     The Racoon Police Department engages in a last stand against the hordes. (Sept. 27)  By Monday evening, the situation for the remaining survivors was rapidly deteriorating, with nearly all forces and amenities depleted and no hope of further evacuation. Marvin Branagh commandeered the remaining forces of the RPD, including SWAT, into enacting a large-scale operation to confront the zombies head-on in a desperate attempt to establish a perimeter and reclaim the immediate area surrounding the Raccoon City Police Station, so it could then  be used in further evacuation efforts. This operation ultimately failed, leaving the remaining officers and civilians inside the station outnumbered and critically low on supplies.
At Umbrella's Underground Lab, Dr. Birkin's senior researcher, Dr. Martin Walcott, was dead, and one of Birkin's assistants, Monica murdered Dr. Frost in the hopes of escaping the city with a G-larvae sample. ""Staffer A"" and ""Staffer B"" were still alive, though seriously injured as the Plant 43 had overtaken the facility in the days since.[36] A Group of survivors including Yoko Suzuki reached the laboratory via a sewer tunnel, and made their way through the facility, unfreezing and dispatching the several remaining Hunter R bioweapons in the facility. Monica was soon parasitized by the G-larvae after being attacked by a Giant Moth; incompatible with the parasite, she was killed as it burst from her chest. The survivors were forced to confront the imperfect ""G"" creature to escape the facility via train to the Marshalling Yard.

September 28th[]
Following the massacres on the 27th, the RPD was limited to roughly a dozen officers stranded within the besieged police station, losing repeatedly against the zombies due to the newly forming licker colony.[28] The UBCS' remaining soldiers had been scattered around the city. Echo Team had been given orders to assist in destroying the Zombies in downtown Raccoon City and recapturing St. Michael's Clock Tower for use as an evacuation site.[37] Only two team members made it to the clock tower. However, after it had been secured the wounded UBCS personnel would fail to ring the bell, and alert the evacuation helicopter leading them to die from their injuries.[38]
On the early morning of September 28, the officers were attacked in the Operations Room and took serious casualties, including David Ford who may have been their senior. Realizing the station was entirely doomed to hold out, the survivors began drawing up plans to escape through the sewers, and Lieutenant Marvin Branagh helped his colleague Rita Philips escape through a secret tunnel in a plan to call over a rescue van. Rita finally made contact with fellow officer Harry and both arrived at the station in a van. However, the station was attacked again and Branagh was infected. He then ordered the survivors to leave without him.[39] Two former S.T.A.R.S. members, Jill Valentine and Brad Vickers, remained stranded in the city. Jill was forced to abandon her apartment in the night, hiding out at a warehouse in Uptown with civilian Dario Rosso. Unaware of its abandonment, Valentine left the warehouse and made her way towards the Raccoon Police Station, running into Vickers on the way. Meeting at the Black Jack Bar, Valentine became aware of the Nemesis-T Type, which had until then been harassing Vickers.[40][41] She would soon encounter the creature at the police station's entrance, resulting in Vickers' mutilation,[42] infection and later zombification. Overhearing an emergency broadcast from Cpl. Carlos Oliveira of the UBCS, Valentine chose to abandon the station and investigate. At least six people were left in the building at this point: Irons, Marvin Branagh, Elliot Edward, Katherine Warren, journalist Ben Bertolucci, and Dr. Birkin's 12-year-old daughter Sherry Birkin.
Valentine joined up with survivors of UBCS Delta Platoon, Cpl. Oliveira, Sgt. Nikolai Zinoviev, and Cpt. Mikhail Viktor. The three planned to escape the city by calling the helicopter at the clock tower, Valentine assisted in the retrieval of components to power a tram to get there. In their attempt, Sgt. Zinoviev disappeared and was presumed dead, and Viktor blew himself with a hand grenade in an attempt to kill the Nemesis-T Type when it boarded the tram. Valentine and Oliveira arrived at the clock tower to find its occupants dead and began seriously doubting their prospects of survival. The rescue helicopter did in fact arrive as planned, though it was shot down by Nemesis to deny Valentine's escape. It was seriously injured in a subsequent fight with her which resulted in her being infected with a mutant strain of t-Virus.

September 29th[]
     On Tuesday night, Umbrella finally acted against Delta Force. They were successful, though all five Tyrants were killed.  
Tuesday 29 September marked a major transition in the military operations in the city. The Pentagon's efforts to control the situation militarily were deemed a failure. The remaining uninfected survivors were given up for dead, and the Army and Army National Guard were ordered to retreat from Raccoon City after they themselves sustained heavy casualties from infected refugees. The retreat was chaotic, and the blockades around the city failed as a result.[43] The only remaining soldiers were, presumably, involved in special operations in the city. As of midnight, Col. Sergei Vladimir assumed command over all Umbrella personnel in and around Raccoon City, and issued orders that a helicopter transport T-103s into the city, deploying one at Raccoon Police Station with orders to kill any surviving officers and then search for G-Virus,[44][45] with an additional five ordered to Incineration Disposal Plant P-12A, where Delta Force had positioned themselves.[44] The third faction, H.C.F., continued its attempts to recover a G-Virus sample, with agent Ada Wong ordered to Raccoon Police Station in search of Bertolucci, who they had hired or were otherwise aware was investigating Umbrella.
With much of the incident still covered-up by the Pentagon, the most up-to-date information publicly available consisted only of a riot, a radiation spill and an apparent outbreak of a skin disease. Those willing to travel into the city in spite of this news were able to do so through the gaps in the blockade, with at least three people entering the same route: rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy, arriving a week late for work after an initial warning not to come in; Claire Redfield, sister of S.T.A.R.S. officer Chris Redfield; and a tanker driver. Accounts differ as to where Kennedy and Redfield met-up, with one suggesting they did so at the Mizoil Gas Station on the city outskirts, while another suggests they did so at a diner in the city.[46] Regardless, they soon found themselves trapped in the city, with the tanker driver becoming infected and colliding with their car.
The Raccoon Police Station continued its decay over the course of Tuesday. By the time of Kennedy and Redfield's arrival in search of shelter, the non-Zombie population was down to nine people, counting themselves. Irons, Branagh and Elliot were the only remaining police officers, with Branagh succumbing to Cannibal Disease and being euthanized soon after and Elliott being infected and killed, in one account during a failed helicopter evacuation. Of the two refugees, Sherry Birkin was in hiding using a series of ventilation tunnels to avoid the Zombies, and Katherine Warren was murdered by Irons who wanted to turn her into a taxidermy work. The remaining two were Bertolucci, the only remaining prisoner, and Wong. It was also at the end of the night that Umbrella deployed T-00 into the police station to complete its mission. Kennedy's exploration of the police station led him to Wong, who manipulated him into aiding her in her search for Umbrella's Underground Lab. During their co-operation, Bertolucci was killed by a mutant, though accounts differ as to if this was T-00, G-Birkin or an infant G. Redfield meanwhile met Sherry and made plans to escape with her after finding proof her brother was not in the city. Accounts differ as to how Redfield escaped the station: in one, Irons took Sherry hostage but was attacked by G-Birkin and died from internal ruptures caused by a G-parasite as Redfield caught up to them at Raccoon City Orphanage. In two other accounts, Redfield instead followed him into his workshop in the police station basement, where he was either killed by G-Birkin or by a parasite escaping him. In all three accounts, however, Redfield departed into the sewers with Sherry.

September 30th[]
During exploration of the sewers, the group met Annette Birkin, who explained the nature of the G-Virus, Umbrella's attack on her husband, and her suspicions of a spy sent to steal the virus. Sherry was found by her father and a parasite was implanted within her body. Though she was found by Redfield, she complained of stomach pains and later passed out. The four made their way into the Umbrella's Lab, where Redfield realized Sherry had been infected. With help from Annette, who would soon after die, she was able to fabricate the G-Virus vaccine, ""DEVIL"". Wong's identity as a spy was confirmed when she tried to steal a G-Virus sample Kennedy obtained. She was knocked unconscious in a fight with T-00 and mistaken for dead, with Kennedy throwing the sample down a chasm in anger. In the daylight hours on 30 September, T-00 was finally destroyed in its Super Tyrant form, Sherry was treated and her father was killed on a train. Kennedy, Redfield and Sherry found themselves far out of the Arklay Mountains and on the plains. Redfield left the two to search for her brother, while Kennedy and Sherry were soon found by U.S. military personnel and detained.
On the night of Wednesday 30 September, USS agent HUNK made radio contact with Umbrella and requested for immediate evacuation. HUNK was part of the two-man team that stole the briefcase from Dr. Birkin, and had survived the attack from the infected virologist with a G-Virus sample on his person.[16] An Umbrella helicopter picked him up at the Raccoon City Police Station and left the city.

October 1st[]
During the week, a Congressional committee including Ron Davis discussed how to solve the crisis in Raccoon City, with input from Derek C. Simmons, who was involved in the American bio-weapons research group which wanted the G-Virus. The solution moved towards bombing, which both served as a means of destroying the mutants as well as serving to destroy any evidence in the city of Umbrella's bio-weapons project, which could be used by rival nations like China as a jumping-off-point for their own projects.[47] Additionally, the destruction of this data would serve to wipe away evidence implying the US military was both aware and supportive of illegal bio-weapons development, allowing them to carefully blame everything on Umbrella USA.[21] Umbrella HQ was aware of the plan to use a thermobaric bomb, and protested to give themselves more time. However, their influence in government affairs was now diminished, and these protests fell on deaf ears. In the final hours, emergency radio messages were transmitted into the city warning any surviving personnel to evacuate immediately. The no-fly zone that was erected around the city was itself lifted, and the US Air Force was given orders to deploy aircraft for the mission.[21]
Cpl. Oliveira searched Raccoon General Hospital for any that might help Valentine, who had been unconscious for two days due to the effects of Nemesis α's t-Virus strain. In his search he discovered the hospital's vaccine research and prepared a sample of the finished vaccine for Valentine. Meanwhile, Sgt. Zinoviev set up C4 charges to destroy the building per his orders and may have been behind the death of fellow Monitor Tyrell Patrick. Cpl. Oliveira and Sgt. Zinoviev escaped before the hospital exploded, and Valentine was treated for her infection.
In anticipation of Raccoon City's destruction, Umbrella executives and mercenary leaders quickly scrambled to finish their missions in the city. One UBCS team had orders to capture or destroy Thanatos,[48] an experimental Tyrant developed by Dr. Greg Mueller, who had left the company in the weeks ahead of the outbreak and was known to be working on a t-Virus reagent called ""Daylight"".[49] The UBCS team was wiped out at Raccoon University with the exception of Sgt. Zinoviev, who succeeded in assassinating Dr. Mueller before leaving. The co-developer of Daylight, Dr. Peter Jenkins, had successfully conscripted Dr. George Hamilton to complete his work before Mueller killed him.[49][50] Thanatos itself was injured when Sgt. Zinoviev set off explosives. However, it continued to pursue Dr. Hamilton's group of civilians in its Super Tyrant form. It was either killed or incapacitated, and the civilians were picked up by a Fire Department helicopter, whose crew had noticed the university explosion.[51] This group of survivors were evacuated with a sample of the Daylight reagent.[note 2]
Another UBCS team still operational, under the command of Arnold and executive Tommy Nielsen, was given last-minute instructions to recover ""Nyx"", an experimental bio-weapon which was stolen from an Umbrella storage depot at the dockyards by rogue USS Cpt. Rodriguez. The team laid landmines to prevent him escaping on foot, with Arnold based on the highway overpass with a sniper rifle in case he avoided them. The team also possessed a rocket launcher should he use a nearby Chinook sitting on the ruined Main Street. Cpt. Rodriguez remained inside the Chinook for some time, having given his co-conspirator Dr. Linda Baldwin time to recover a viral suppressant named ""AT1521"" from the Umbrella R&D Center. The facility had already been raided by David King's team of survivors and Dr. Carter, who were also searching for AT1521. To escape the building, now controlled by escaped Hunter R bioweapons, Dr. Carter released the experimental T-103 variant, ""Tyrant R"".[52] The Tyrant soon turned on them however, and killed Dr. Carter destroying the sample in the process.[53] Dr. Baldwin, the only one left alive with knowledge on how to create the suppressant, was rescued by King's team after falling down a shaft into the sewers, but was soon washed away by water. Dr. Baldwin was shot by Arnold, who mistook her for a zombie, and sought shelter at the Apple Inn, where she was later rescued. The UBCS team rebelled against Nielsen when Arnold received the emergency radio transmission, and they began preparations to evacuate via left-over Army vehicles in the nearby roadblock on the highway overpass. Whether or not Cpt. Rodriguez escaped with Nyx is uncertain, but its escape would have ensured the demise of the team.[note 3]
Ada Wong, injured during her experiences and escape from Umbrella's Lab managed to escape into the sewers before the lab was destroyed.[54] Though having lost the G-Virus sample, she was able to recover a tissue fragment from Birkin, containing G-Cells that could be of use for the Organization.[14][44] Per her orders, she headed for the Apple Inn and meet with a liaison hiding in an upstairs room. The man had given up waiting in her absence, however, and killed himself to prevent mutation. Wong's superior, Dr. Albert Wesker, notified her of an Umbrella helicopter set to escape Raccoon City. This helicopter was the same one used to drop off the T-103s several days prior, now carrying Col. Vladimir, an Umbrella executive, and the UMF-013 supercomputer originally retrieved from the Arklay Laboratory prior to its destruction.[44] Wong, armed with the liaison's hookshot, was able to quickly traverse the destroyed streets and made her way up the highway overpass where she fought Tyrant R. Wong succeeded in destroying the Tyrant and used her hookshot to ride out of the city.[55]

     The detonation of a top secret missile which completely destroyed the city.  
Meanwhile, Valentine and Cpl. Oliveira moved independently through Raccoon Park, in the direction of Incineration Disposal Plant P-12A, with both overhearing radio evacuation orders along the way.[56] While Valentine explored a cabin, she discovered Sgt. Zinoviev, who may have killed the radio operator.[57] All three made their way into the P-12A plant, though Sgt. Zinoviev succeeded in capturing a helicopter and fleeing, leaving Valentine and Cpl. Oliveira behind. Valentine fought and seriously wounded the Nemesis-T Type in a treatment room; the Tyrant was dropped into the treatment chemicals which, while weakened, were potent enough to destroy the Tyrant body.[58] The parasite, however, lived on and was able to drag the body out into the outside world. Finding itself in a scrap yard where a Delta Force unit and the five T-103 Super Tyrants annihilated one another, the parasite began consuming from one of the Super Tyrant bodies to regain its strength, and mutated further, effectively becoming the main organism and the Tyrant body a parasite.[59] An experimental railgun named the ""Sword of Paracelsus"", brought into the yard by Delta Force, was used against the creature by Valentine. The two survivors were then picked up by former S.T.A.R.S. officer Barry Burton, who had been waiting for the no-fly restrictions to be lifted to rescue Valentine.[21] Having gotten in contact with Cpl. Oliveira, he knew to land at the scrap yard. The three escaped just as the missile arrived and struck directly into the heart of the city, and the helicopter was hit by the shockwave though remained in the air. At least 100,000 people (infected and non-infected) along with B.O.W.s were killed and everything within the city's limit was turned into a huge crater as a result of the bombing.

Aftermath[]
The Raccoon City Destruction Incident had global ramifications. The events of the incident, including the destruction, were covered up by the government, with only portions of the destruction and the overall incident, namely the Umbrella Corporation's ties to it, being publicly revealed for Umbrella's shutdown and bankruptcy. It also put an irreversible setback into Spencer's plans to create a new race due to the research notes for his eugenics project, Project W (which also resulted in the creation of Albert Wesker himself) being lost in the destruction. Immediately after Raccoon City's sterilization, the then President of the United States resigned from office following a disastrous press conference amidst worldwide public and media outrage.[19]
Within six months of the bombing, a perimeter fence was set up around the city ruins, with the exclusion zone still in force. A government research station was established in the center of the ruins to collect samples on the t-Virus, though it is uncertain what this was for.[60] At some point during the recent aftermath of the bombing, the United States Secret Service Department of Biohazard Containment and Prevention conducted an investigation into the events of the Raccoon City incident and documented their findings based on analyzed data and survivor testimonies in a report stored in their list of archived threat assessments.
Publicly, the t-Virus' existence, and that of B.O.W.s, continued to be denied by the US government for years. The newly established Anti-Umbrella Pursuit and Investigation Team, set up in light of Delta Force's losses, took on responsibilities in destroying biohazardous material and killing or detaining current and former Umbrella employees suspected of smuggling bio-weaponry across the world, along with their customers. In 2002, these would include searching for a smuggler and a drug lord in the Amazon Rainforest, and an unofficial joint mission with the Chinese security forces to destroy a missile silo intended to disperse t-Virus across both countries. It would not be until the Terragrigia Panic of mid-2004 that the world at large saw the reality of bio-weaponry, which led to a rapid increase in their prominence in the black market and use in attacks.
The United States itself was not free from bioterrorism. In 2005, the city of St. Cloud, Minnesota fell victim to an outbreak, and Harvardville was struck twice by Dr. Curtis Miller, the latter in an attempt to force the US government to admit to the Raccoon City cover-up. During the presidency of Adam Benford, the possibility of disclosing classified information about the outbreak became a serious policy. This would draw the attention of The Family and its leader, Simmons himself. To prevent China reaping from both information on bio-weaponry and the inevitable loss of prestige placed on the US if such information was revealed, The Family would orchestrate a massive outbreak in Tall Oaks as a means of assassinating the President under the guise of a terrorist attack, with another Sterilization Operation ordered to conveniently eliminate evidence. Over 70,000 were killed during this outbreak, which lasted a mere day.

What is the U Visa for victims of crime?,"The U Visa is a nonimmigrant visa category that allows individuals who have suffered persecution or who are victims of certain crimes in the United States to remain in the country and work towards a path to permanent residency. The U Visa program was created to provide a pathway to legal status and a path to citizenship for individuals who may not otherwise be eligible for such benefits.

To be eligible for the U Visa, an individual must have suffered persecution or be a victim of a qualifying crime, such as human trafficking, domestic violence, gang-related activity, or certain forms of violent crime. The individual must also have cooperated with law enforcement or immigration authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the crime.

Once an individual has been approved for a U Visa, they are eligible to stay in the United States and work towards a path to permanent residency. The U Visa program also provides certain benefits, such as the ability to apply for employment authorization and to apply for a Green Card (a permanent residency card).

Examples of specific names, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, and other details related to the U Visa program include:

* In 2022, the U Visa program was used to grant lawful permanent resident status to more than 1,000 individuals who had suffered persecution or were victims of certain crimes in the United States.
* In 2021, the U Visa program was used to grant lawful permanent resident status to more than 1,000 individuals who had suffered persecution or were victims of certain crimes in the United States.
* In 2020, the U Visa program was used to grant lawful permanent resident status to more than 1,000 individuals who had suffered persecution or were victims of certain crimes in the United States.

It is worth noting that the U Visa program is a relatively new program and the specific details and examples can vary depending on the year and the specific circumstances of each case.",False,https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/victims-of-criminal-activity-u-nonimmigrant-status,"

ALERT: The filing location for U nonimmigrant-based Form I-485 is now only at the Nebraska Service Center.

The U nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity. Congress created the U nonimmigrant visa with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (including the Battered Immigrant Women’s Protection Act) in October 2000. The legislation was intended to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of aliens and other crimes, while also protecting victims of crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse due to the crime and are willing to help law enforcement authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity. The legislation also helps law enforcement agencies to better serve victims of crimes.To learn about updates to the program, visit our U Nonimmigrant Status Program Updates page.U Nonimmigrant EligibilityYou may be eligible for a U nonimmigrant visa if:You are the victim of qualifying criminal activity.You have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been a victim of criminal activity.You have information about the criminal activity.

However, there is no cap for family members deriving status from the principal applicant, such as spouses, children, or other eligible family members.If the cap is reached before all U nonimmigrant petitions have been adjudicated, USCIS will create a waiting list for any eligible principal or derivative petitioners that are awaiting a final decision and a U visa. Petitioners placed on the waiting list will be granted deferred action or parole and are eligible to apply for work authorization while waiting for additional U visas to become available.Once additional visas become available, petitioners on the waiting list and those who have received a bona fide determination will receive their visa in the order in which their petition was received. Petitioners do not have to take any additional steps to request the U visa. USCIS will notify the petitioner of the approval and the accompanying U visa.Note to Petitioners: Principal U nonimmigrant petitioners are employment authorized incident to status, after the underlying petition for U nonimmigrant status is approved and an employment authorization document is automatically issued without filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.Derivative family members residing inside the United States are also employment authorized incident to status, however an employment authorization document is not automatically issued. Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, may be filed for a derivative to obtain an employment authorization document.Employment authorization for principals and derivatives can only be issued after the underlying U nonimmigrant status petition is approved, regardless of when the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, is filed.Principal petitioners and derivative family members living in the United States may receive employment authorization and deferred action if the underlying pending petition is bona fide, and they meet certain discretionary standards. USCIS will issue a notice if the principal petitioner or derivative family member needs to file a Form I-765 for employment authorization associated with a bona fide determination.If the statutory cap is reached in a fiscal year and USCIS uses the waiting list process described at 8 CFR 214.14(d)(2), petitioners for U nonimmigrant status and derivatives in the United States can apply for employment authorization using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on deferred action.  An application for employment authorization based on deferred action can only be approved after DHS has deferred action in your case, regardless of when the Form I-765 is filedApplying for a Green CardYou may be eligible to apply for a Green Card (adjustment of status/permanent residence) if you meet certain requirements, including:You have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least three years while in U nonimmigrant status, andYou have not unreasonably refused to provide assistance to law enforcement since you received your U visa.To apply for permanent residence (a Green Card) for yourself or a qualifying family member, visit our Green Card for a Victim of a Crime (U Nonimmigrant) page.PLEASE NOTE: Any qualifying family member who does not have a derivative U visa when the principal U nonimmigrant receives a Green Card is no longer eligible for a derivative U visa, but may still be eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence.For information on extending your principal U visa to ensure your family member remains eligible for a U visa, please visit the T and U visa extension memorandum.Family Members Deriving StatusIf the family member deriving status based on your status has met the eligibility requirements for a Green Card, they may apply for lawful permanent residence by filing their own Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.Even if your family members never had U nonimmigrant status or a U visa, they may still be eligible for a Green Card.First, you must file a Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Nonimmigrant, for each eligible family member.You may file the Form I-929 at the same time or after you file your Form I-485.If the Form I-929 for your family member(s) is approved:Family members in the United States may file the Form I-485 to apply for a Green Card.Family members outside the United States must first visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to obtain their immigrant visa.

What is the Norwalk virus?,"The Norwalk virus is a type of RNA virus that is closely related to the hepatitis A virus. It is a member of the Picornaviridae family and is a single-stranded RNA virus.

The Norwalk virus was first identified in 1968, and since then, it has been responsible for outbreaks of foodborne illness in many countries around the world. The virus is spread through contaminated food and water, and can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.

In recent years, there have been several outbreaks of foodborne illness caused by the Norwalk virus in the United States. In 2017, there were 5,134 cases reported, with 18 deaths. In 2018, there were 5,546 cases reported, with 22 deaths.

Examples of outbreaks of foodborne illness caused by the Norwalk virus in the United States include:

* In 2017, there was an outbreak of foodborne illness caused by the Norwalk virus in New York City, where 1,500 people were sickened. The outbreak was linked to contaminated lettuce from a local farm.
* In 2018, there was an outbreak of foodborne illness caused by the Norwalk virus in Florida, where 1,100 people were sickened. The outbreak was linked to contaminated oysters from a local seafood market.
* In 2019, there was an outbreak of foodborne illness caused by the Norwalk virus in California, where 1,000 people were sickened. The outbreak was linked to contaminated raspberries from a local farm.

It's important to note that the Norwalk virus is not the same as the hepatitis A virus, which is a different type of virus that causes a different type of illness. However, both viruses can cause similar symptoms and outbreaks of foodborne illness are common when either virus is involved.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus,"

Type of viruses that cause gastroenteritis

The white bar = 50 nm.SpecialtyEmergency medicine, pediatricsSymptomsDiarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, headache[2]ComplicationsDehydration[2]Usual onset12 to 48 hours after exposure[2]Duration1 to 3 days[2]CausesNorovirus[3]Diagnostic methodBased on symptoms[3]PreventionHand washing, disinfection of contaminated surfaces[4]TreatmentSupportive care (drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids)[5]Frequency685 million cases per year[6]Deaths200,000 per year[6][7]
Norovirus, also known as Norwalk virus and sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting disease, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis.[1][6] Infection is characterized by non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain.[2][3] Fever or headaches may also occur.[2] Symptoms usually develop 12 to 48 hours after being exposed, and recovery typically occurs within one to three days.[2] Complications are uncommon, but may include dehydration, especially in the young, the old, and those with other health problems.[2]
The virus is usually spread by the fecal–oral route.[3] This may be through contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact.[3] It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through air from the vomit of an infected person.[3] Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation and sharing close quarters.[3] Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms.[3] Confirmatory testing is not usually available but may be performed by public health agencies during outbreaks.[3]
Prevention involves proper hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces.[4] There is no vaccine or specific treatment for norovirus.[4][5] Management involves supportive care such as drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids.[5] Oral rehydration solutions are the preferred fluids to drink, although other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help.[5] Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against the norovirus, according to the NHS information page on the subject;[8] this is due to norovirus being a non-enveloped virus.
Norovirus results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200,000 deaths globally a year.[6][7] It is common both in the developed and developing world.[3][9] Those under the age of five are most often affected, and in this group it results in about 50,000 deaths in the developing world.[6] Norovirus infections occur more commonly during winter months.[6] It often occurs in outbreaks, especially among those living in close quarters.[3] In the United States, it is the cause of about half of all foodborne disease outbreaks.[3] The virus is named after the city of Norwalk, Ohio, US, where an outbreak occurred in 1968.[10]


Signs and symptoms[edit]
Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus.[11] General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous, and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days.[1]
Norovirus can establish a long-term infection in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with common variable immunodeficiency or with a suppressed immune system after organ transplantation.[12] These infections can be with or without symptoms.[12] In severe cases, persistent infections can lead to norovirus‐associated enteropathy, intestinal villous atrophy, and malabsorption.[12]

Transmission[edit]
Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks)[13] and indirectly via contaminated water and food.  Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit or by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up.[14] The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided, and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.[15]
Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively and appears to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread the infection across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit.[16] In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one person vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick person later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick person. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the infection rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.[17]
In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people.[18] A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools, and ice machines.[19]
Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often implicated in norovirus outbreaks. Ingestion of shellfish that has not been sufficiently heated – under 75 °C (167 °F) – poses a high risk for norovirus infection.[20][21] Foods other than shellfish may be contaminated by infected food handlers.[22] Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by only one infected person.[23]
From March and August 2017, in Quebec, Canada, there was an outbreak of norovirus that sickened more than 700 people. According to an investigation by Canada's CFIA Food Control Agency, the culprit was frozen raspberries imported from Harbin Gaotai Food Co Ltd, a Chinese supplier. Canadian authorities subsequently issued a recall on raspberries products from Harbin Gaotai.[24]
According to the CDC, there was a surge in norovirus cases on thirteen cruise ships in 2023, which marks the highest number of outbreaks since 2012.[25]

Classification[edit]
Noroviruses (NoV) are a genetically diverse group of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[26][27] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the genus Norovirus has one species, which is called Norwalk virus.[26]
Noroviruses can genetically be classified into at least seven different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, GVI, and GVII), which can be further divided into other genetic clusters or genotypes.[28]
Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes Norwalk virus, Desert Shield virus, and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.[27]
Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII.[29]
Noroviruses from genogroup II, genotype 4 (abbreviated as GII.4) account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe.[30]
Recent examples include US95/96-US strain, associated with global outbreaks in the mid- to late-1990s; Farmington Hills virus associated with outbreaks in Europe and the United States in 2002 and in 2004; and Hunter virus which was associated with outbreaks in Europe, Japan, and Australasia. In 2006, there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe.[31] Reports have shown a link between the expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and the susceptibility to norovirus infection. Studies have suggested the capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs.[32] HBGAs are not, however, the receptor or facilitator of norovirus infection. Co-factors such as bile salts may facilitate the infection, making it more intense when introduced during or after the initial infection of the host tissue.[33] Bile salts are produced by the liver in response to eating fatty foods, and they help with the absorption of consumed lipids. It is not yet clear at what specific point in the Norovirus replication cycle bile salts facilitate infection: penetration, uncoating, or maintaining capsid stability.[33]
The protein MDA-5 may be the primary immune sensor that detects the presence of noroviruses in the body.[34]  Some people have common variations of the MDA-5 gene that could make them more susceptible to norovirus infection.[35]

Viruses in Norovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries. Capsid diameters vary widely, from 23 to 40 nm in diameter. The larger capsids (38–40 nm) exhibit T=3 symmetry and are composed of 180 VP1 proteins. Small capsids (23 nm) show T=1 symmetry, and are composed of 60 VP1 proteins.[36] The virus particles demonstrate an amorphous surface structure when visualized using electron microscopy.[37]

Genome[edit]
Noroviruses contain a linear, non-segmented,[36] positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kilobases, encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7)[38] by the viral 3C-like protease (NS6), a major structural protein (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2).[39]
The most variable region of the viral capsid is the P2 domain, which contains antigen-presenting sites and carbohydrate-receptor binding regions.[40][41][42][43][44]

Evolution[edit]
Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 last shared a common ancestor in AD 867.[45] The group 2 and group 4 viruses last shared a common ancestor in approximately AD 1443 (95% highest posterior density AD 1336–1542).[46] Several estimates of the evolution rate have been made varying from 8.98 × 10−3 to 2.03 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year.[citation needed]
The estimated mutation rate (1.21×10−2 to 1.41 ×10−2 substitutions per site per year) in this virus is high even compared with other RNA viruses.[47]
In addition, a recombination hotspot exists at the ORF1-ORF2 (VP1) junction.[48]

Replication cycle[edit]
Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Positive-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of replication. Translation takes place by leaky scanning and RNA termination-reinitiation. Humans and other mammals serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and contamination.[36]

Pathophysiology[edit]
When a person becomes infected with norovirus, the virus replicates within the small intestine. The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis, characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, that develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure and lasts for 24–72 hours.[49] Sometimes there is loss of taste, general lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, cough, and/or low-grade fever. The disease is usually self-limiting.[citation needed]
Severe illness is rare; although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward, they are rarely admitted to the hospital. The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around 570–800[50] each year, with most of these occurring in the very young, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may become life-threatening in these groups if dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is ignored or left untreated.[51]

Diagnosis[edit]
Specific diagnosis of norovirus is routinely made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays or quantitative PCR assays, which give results within a few hours. These assays are very sensitive and can detect as few as 10 virus particles.[52]
Tests such as ELISA that use antibodies against a mixture of norovirus strains are available commercially, but lack specificity and sensitivity.[53]

Prevention[edit]
After infection, immunity to the same strain of the virus – the genotype – protects against reinfection for six months to two years.[54] This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus.[54]
In Canada, norovirus is a notifiable disease.[55] In both the US and the UK it is not notifiable.[56][57]

Hand washing and disinfectants[edit]
Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% isopropyl alcohol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope.[58] Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.[49][59][60]

Health care facilities[edit]
In healthcare environments, the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2 systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.[61]
In 2011, the CDC published a clinical practice guideline addressing strategies for the prevention and control of norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings.[62][63] Based on a systematic review of published scientific studies, the guideline presents 51 specific evidence-based recommendations, which were organized into 12 categories: 1) patient cohorting and isolation precautions, 2) hand hygiene, 3) patient transfer and ward closure, 4) food handlers in healthcare, 5) diagnostics, 6) personal protective equipment, 7) environmental cleaning, 8) staff leave and policy, 9) visitors, 10) education, 11) active case-finding, and 12) communication and notification. The guideline also identifies eight high-priority recommendations and suggests several areas in need of future research.[citation needed]

Vaccine trials[edit]
LigoCyte announced in 2007 that it was working on a vaccine and had started phase 1 trials.[64] The company has since been taken over by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.[65] As of 2019[update], a bivalent (NoV GI.1/GII.4) intramuscular vaccine had completed phase 1 trials.[66][67] In 2020 the phase 2b trials were finished.[68][69] The vaccine relies on using a virus-like particle that is made of the norovirus capsid proteins in order to mimic the external structure of the virus. Since there is no RNA in this particle, it is incapable of reproducing and cannot cause an infection.[64]

Persistence[edit]
The norovirus can survive for long periods outside a human host depending on the surface and temperature conditions:  it can survive for weeks on hard and soft surfaces,[70] and it can survive for months, maybe even years in contaminated still water.[71] A 2006 study found the virus remained on surfaces used for food preparation seven days after contamination.[72]

Detection in food[edit]
Routine protocols to detect norovirus in clams and oysters by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are being employed by governmental laboratories such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US.[73]

Treatment[edit]
There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Norovirus infection cannot be treated with antibiotics because it is a virus. Treatments aim to avoid complications by measures such as the management of dehydration caused by fluid loss in vomiting and diarrhea,[5] and to mitigate symptoms using antiemetics and antidiarrheals.[74]

Epidemiology[edit]

Norovirus causes about 18% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. It is relatively common in developed countries and in low-mortality developing countries (20% and 19% respectively) compared to high-mortality developing countries (14%). Proportionately it causes more illness in people in the community or in hospital outpatients (24% and 20% respectively) as compared with hospital inpatients (17%) in whom other causes are more common.[76]
Age and emergence of new norovirus strains do not appear to affect the proportion of gastroenteritis attributable to norovirus.[76]
In the United States, the estimated annual number of norovirus cases in 2023[update] was 21 million,[77] representing a rate of 6,270 cases per 100,000 individuals.
Norovirus is a common cause of epidemics of gastroenteritis on cruise ships. The CDC, through its Vessel Sanitation Program, records and investigates outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness – mostly caused by norovirus – on cruise ships with both a US and foreign itinerary;[78] there were 12 in 2015, and 10 from 1 January to 9 May 2016. An outbreak may affect over 25% of passengers, and a smaller proportion of crew members.[79]

Human genetics[edit]
Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABO(H) (histo-blood group) phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner.[80][81] GII.4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more histo-blood group antigens than other genogroups.[80] FUT2 fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar to the end of the ABO(H) precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands. The ABH-antigen produced is thought to act as a receptor for human norovirus: A non-functional fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high protection from the most common norovirus strain, GII.4.[82]
Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH-antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong – although not absolute – protection from the norovirus GII.4.[83] Non-secretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes, as the precursor is formed by FUT1.[80] Some norovirus genotypes (GI.3) can infect non-secretors.[84]

History[edit]
The norovirus was originally named the ""Norwalk agent"" after Norwalk, Ohio, in the United States, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November 1968. In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name ""Norwalk virus"". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The cloning and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[85] The name ""norovirus"" (Norovirus for the genus) was approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2002.[86] In 2011, however, a press release and a newsletter were published by ICTV, which strongly encouraged the media, national health authorities, and the scientific community to use the virus name Norwalk virus, rather than the genus name Norovirus when referring to outbreaks of the disease. This was also a public response by ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name ""Noro"". Before this position of ICTV was made public, ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case.[87]
In addition to ""Norwalk agent"" and ""Norwalk virus"", the virus has also been called ""Norwalk-like virus"", ""small, round-structured viruses"" (SRSVs), Spencer flu, and ""Snow Mountain virus"".[88] Common names of the illness caused by noroviruses still in use include ""Roskilde illness"", ""winter vomiting disease"",[89] ""winter vomiting bug"",[90][91] ""viral gastroenteritis"", and ""acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis"".[51]

What is the Triple Entry Accounting system?,"The triple entry accounting system is a method of accounting that records financial transactions in three separate accounts: the debit account, the credit account, and the ledger account. It is also known as the double entry bookkeeping system.

In the triple entry accounting system, every financial transaction is recorded in three separate accounts. For example, if a company sells an item to a customer, the transaction is recorded in three accounts: the sales account, the accounts receivable account, and the cost of goods sold account.

The sales account is debited because the company is receiving money from the sale. The accounts receivable account is also debited because the company is extending credit to the customer. The cost of goods sold account is also debited because the company is recording the cost of the item sold.

The accounts receivable account is credited because the company is extending credit to the customer. The sales account is also credited because the company is receiving money from the sale. The cost of goods sold account is also credited because the company is recording the cost of the item sold.

This system ensures that every financial transaction is recorded in the correct account, and that the accounts are balanced at the end of the accounting period.

For example, if a company has a sales revenue of $10,000 and a cost of goods sold of $5,000, the triple entry accounting system would record the following transactions:

Debit Sales account $10,000
Credit Accounts Receivable account $10,000
Credit Cost of Goods Sold account $5,000

This system is simple to understand and use, and it is widely used in small and large businesses, as well as in non-profit organizations. It is also used in government accounting and in education.

In summary, the triple entry accounting system is a method of accounting that records financial transactions in three separate accounts: the debit account, the credit account, and the ledger account. It is also known as the double entry bookkeeping system. It ensures that every financial transaction is recorded in the correct account, and that the accounts are balanced at the end of the accounting period.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_accounting_and_triple-entry_bookkeeping,"

Momentum accounting and triple-entry book keeping is an alternative accountancy system developed by Japanese academic Yuji Ijiri and the subject of his 1989 monograph.[1] It is proposed as an alternative to double-entry bookkeeping, which is the standard method used in the worldwide financial accounting system.
Momentum accounting and triple-entry bookkeeping introduce changes to traditional double-entry bookkeeping by tracking balances, revenue earning, and cash collection. These events are recorded with two entries, typically a debit and a credit, assigned on a specific date. In momentum accounting, changes in balances are the recognized events.


Example[edit]
An acceleration in revenue earning, such as a $1,000 per period increase of revenues from $10,000 per month to $11,000 per month, would require three entries to implement.

What is the Event Horizon Telescope?,"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a collaboration of scientists and engineers from around the world who have come together to create the world's largest radio telescope. The EHT is designed to study events that occur at the edge of black holes, such as the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way.

The EHT consists of a network of radio telescopes located in different parts of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Asia. The telescopes are linked together using sophisticated software to form a single virtual telescope with a much larger collecting area than any single telescope could have on its own.

The EHT was first proposed in 2006 by a team of astronomers led by Stephen Hawking, a theoretical physicist who was well-known for his work on black holes. The EHT was officially launched in 2017, and since then, it has been working to study the event horizon of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.

One of the key scientists involved in the EHT is Dr. Sheperd Doeleman, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has played a leading role in the development and operation of the EHT. Doeleman is a co-chair of the EHT's collaboration and has been involved in the project since its inception.

In addition to Doeleman, other prominent scientists involved in the EHT include astrophysicists from the United States, Europe, and Asia who have contributed to the design, construction, and operation of the EHT.

The EHT has made several important discoveries since its launch, including the first direct observation of a black hole shadow. In 2019, the EHT also announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of space-time that are produced by certain types of astronomical events.

The EHT has also been involved in several high-profile events, including the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to three scientists who developed the technology that made the EHT possible.

Overall, the Event Horizon Telescope is a remarkable achievement that has brought together scientists and engineers from around the world to study one of the most mysterious and fascinating phenomena in the universe.",True,https://eventhorizontelescope.org/,"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Pepsi Refresh Project (PRP) was a 2010 initiative by PepsiCo to award $20 million in grants to individuals, businesses and non-profits that promote a new idea that has a positive impact on their community, state, or the nation. The project is completely separate from the Pepsi Corporate Foundation and uses money budgeted for marketing.[1]
More than 80 million votes were registered and, at its peak, 37% of Americans were aware of the Refresh Project.[2]
This project has been the focus of a 2013 Harvard Business School case (""The Pepsi Refresh Project: a Thirst for Change""), describing the process that Pepsi's marketing team, led by senior marketing director Ana Maria Irazabal, went through to come up with this idea.[3]
In early 2012, Pepsi abandoned the Refresh Project. One opinion is due to declining market share and falling to third place behind Coke and Diet Coke.[4]


Rules[edit]
The PRP began on January 13, 2010 when the website, refresheverything.com began accepting ideas online. In contrast to the extensive requirements of Federal and Philanthropic organizations, the application process did not require skill in grant writing. The rules of the project state that the first 1,000 ideas proposed online each month will be considered for a share of $1.3 million available[5] It took less than a week for one thousand ""January"" ideas to be submitted and the site stopped accepting ideas.
Voting started February 1, 2010 for the group of ideas proposed during January. On March 1, the first grants were announced[6] in six categories: Health, Arts & Culture, Food & Shelter, the Planet, Neighborhoods and Education.[6]
Up to 32 ideas may be selected every month in each of the following grant segments: $5K; $25K; $50K; and $250k. Individuals, non-profits, and socially beneficial businesses are eligible to compete in all categories.
In September 2010, the Pepsi Refresh Project was criticized for allowing a coalition of progressive, nonprofit organizations called the 'Progressive Slate' to participate in the project, accusing the company of violating its own terms.[7]

Power votes[edit]
Codes printed on Pepsi sodas could be redeemed for ""power votes"",[8] in a way a hybrid of a loyalty program and crowd funding. The soft drink marketer had placed an alphanumeric code under the caps of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max two-liter and 20-oz. bottles, as well as 12-pack and 24-pack carton wraps. Each code was worth between five and 100 votes; participants entered the code on the Power Vote page on the Pepsi Refresh site to find out its worth.

Metrics[edit]
The Pepsi Refresh Project generated more than 80 million votes and ""37% of Americans were aware of the Refresh Project"".[2]
The Pepsi Refresh Project included the risks associated with digital promotions, due to the nature of the campaign. ""This was not corporate philanthropy. This was using brand dollars with the belief that when you use these brand dollars to have consumers share ideas to change the world, the consumers will win, the brand will win and the community will win. This was a big bet. No one has done it on this scale before"", declares the head of digital, Shiv Singh.

NFL[edit]
Prior to Super Bowl XLIV, the National Football League website hosted a one-week Pepsi Refresh Project contest for ideas suggested by NFL players. Drew Brees was the winner of the ""Super Bowl Refresh Project"" with more than half a million votes. A $100,000 grant was given to the Hope Lodge in New Orleans for no-cost housing of cancer patients and families.[9]

Gulf disaster[edit]
In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, on July 12, 2010 a special competition was announced within the PRP: Do Good for the Gulf. An additional $1.3 million was committed to projects for communities in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas which were adversely affected by the disaster.[10]  The application period was a full month, the response was overwhelming, and 32 projects were funded with grants,[11] which ranged from providing mental health services for oil disaster victims, to building seafood farms to help employ displaced workers, to creating shelters for animals that lost their homes.[12]

Donnie Yen Chi-tan (Chinese: 甄子丹; born 27 July 1963) is a Hong Kong[1] actor, filmmaker, martial artist, and action director.[4][5] He is the recipient of various accolades, including three Golden Horse Awards and five Hong Kong Film Awards. He is best known for portraying Wing Chun grandmaster Ip Man in the Ip Man film series, namely Ip Man (2008), Ip Man 2 (2010), Ip Man 3 (2015), and Ip Man 4: The Finale (2019). He also served as co-producer for the spin-off Master Z: Ip Man Legacy (2018).
Born in Guangdong, Yen developed an interest in martial arts at a young age, and began experimenting with various styles, including tai chi and other traditional Chinese martial arts. At age 18, he auditioned for action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping in Hong Kong. He landed his first starring role in the 1984 Hong Kong martial arts action film  Drunken Tai Chi. He made his breakthrough role as the antagonist General Nap-lan in Once Upon a Time in China II (1992), opposite Jet Li's character. He appeared in several other Hong Kong kung fu films, including Iron Monkey (1993) and Wing Chun (1994).[6] In 1997, he starred in his directorial debut film Legend of the Wolf.
Yen made his American debut in Highlander: Endgame (2000), followed by a cameo in Blade II (2002). He went on to appear in the American films Shanghai Knights (2003), Rogue One (2016), XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017), Mulan (2020), and John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023).[7] He has continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema, appearing in the well-received films Hero (2002), SPL: Sha Po Lang (2005), 14 Blades (2010), Wu Xia (2011), Kung Fu Jungle (2014), Chasing the Dragon (2017), Enter the Fat Dragon (2020), Raging Fire (2021), and Sakra (2023), among others. In television, Yen portrayed fictional character Chen Zhen in the television series Fist of Fury (1995); he reprised the role in the 2010 film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen.
For portraying Ip Man in the Ip Man film series (2008-2019), Yen is credited by many for contributing to the popularisation of Wing Chun in China.[8] Alongside Kung fu, particularly Wing Chun, Yen is also known for incorporating mixed martial arts (MMA) elements into his action choreography. Aside from his acting, in 1997, he established his own production company, Bullet Films, which choreographed the action for Western blockbusters like Blade II (2002) and Stormbreaker (2006).[9]


Early life[edit]
Yen was born on 27 July 1963 in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. His mother, Bow-sim Mark, is a Fu-style wudangquan (internal martial arts) and tai chi grandmaster, while his father, Klyster Yen (甄雲龍), was a newspaper editor.[10] When he was 2 years old, his family moved to Hong Kong and then to the United States when he was 11 years old, settling in Boston.[11] He attended Newton North High School.[12][non-primary source needed]
His younger sister, Chris Yen, is also a martial artist and actress, and appeared in the 2007 film Adventures of Johnny Tao: Rock Around the Dragon.
At a young age, under the influence of his mother, Yen developed an interest in martial arts and began experimenting with various styles, including tai chi and other traditional Chinese martial arts.[13] At age 16, Yen began practising Wushu after his parents sent him to Beijing to train with the Beijing Wushu Team.[13]
At age 18, when Yen was returning to the United States to visit his family, he made a stop in Hong Kong, where he met and auditioned for action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping.[13]
Yen comes from a family of musicians. His mother is a soprano, in addition to being a martial arts teacher in Boston, while his father is a violinist.[14] From a young age, he was taught by his parents to play musical instruments, including the piano.[15][16]

Career[edit]
Beginnings to the 1990s[edit]
Yen's first step into the film industry was when he landed his first starring role in the 1984 film Drunken Tai Chi. After filming Drunken Tai Chi and Tiger Cage (1988), Yen made his breakthrough role as General Nap-lan in Once Upon a Time in China II (1992), which included a fight scene between his character and Wong Fei-hung (portrayed by Jet Li).[13] Yen had a starring role in the film Iron Monkey in 1993. Yen and Li appeared together again in the 2002 film Hero, where Yen played a spear (or qiang) fighter who fought with Li's character, an unnamed swordsman.[13] The film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2003 Academy Awards.
In 1995, Yen starred as Chen Zhen in the television series Fist of Fury produced by ATV, which is adapted from the 1972 film of the same title that starred Bruce Lee as Chen Zhen. Yen reprised his role as Chen Zhen in the 2010 film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen by replacing Li who starred as Chen Zhen in the prequel film Fist of Legend, which was released in 1994.
In 1997, Yen started the production company Bullet Films, and made his directorial debut[17] in Legend of the Wolf (1997) and Ballistic Kiss (1998), in which he played the lead character. At age 34, Yen almost went bankrupt. Films produced by his own production company and directed by him were critically acclaimed but did not do well at the box office. Yen was forced to borrow money from loan sharks and his production crew to get by.

2000s: Breakthrough success[edit]
Yen in Seoul in 2005
Yen went back to the United States, where he was invited to choreograph fight scenes in Hollywood films, such as Highlander: Endgame (2000) and Blade II (2002). His choreography and skills impressed the directors, and they invited him for cameo appearances in both films.[18] In 2002, Li was filming Hero and insisted to director Zhang Yimou that he wanted Yen to play the role of Sky, his adversary, due to Yen's martial arts ability. Li personally invited Yen back from Hollywood to star in the film, marking the second time the two actors appeared onscreen together since Once Upon a Time in China II 10 years earlier back in 1992.[19] In 2003, Yen portrayed antagonist Wu Chow against Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson in Shanghai Knights.
Yen choreographed most of the fight animation in the 2004 video game Onimusha 3, which featured actors Takeshi Kaneshiro and Jean Reno. Yen continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema in the 2000s, starring as Chu Zhaonan in Tsui Hark's wuxia epic film Seven Swords, and as Ma Kwun in Wilson Yip's brutal crime drama film SPL: Sha Po Lang in 2005. Both films were featured at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Later that year, Yen co-starred with Nicholas Tse and Shawn Yue in Wilson Yip's Dragon Tiger Gate, an adaptation of Wong Yuk-long's manhua series Oriental Heroes. Yen worked as action choreographer in Stormbreaker, starring Alex Pettyfer. Yen continued to work with Wilson Yip in Flash Point (2007), in which he starred as the lead character and served as producer and action choreographer for the film. He won the award for Best Action Choreography at the Golden Horse Film Awards and the Hong Kong Film Awards for his performance in Flash Point.
In 2008, Yen starred in Ip Man, a semi-biographical account of Ip Man, the Wing Chun master of Bruce Lee. Ip Man marked Yen's fourth collaboration with director Wilson Yip, reuniting him with his co-stars in SPL: Sha Po Lang, Sammo Hung and Simon Yam. Ip Man became the biggest box office hit to date featuring Yen in the leading role, grossing HK$25 million in Hong Kong and 100 million yuan in China.[20][21]

2010s[edit]
Yen at the New York Film Festival in 2012
In 2010, Ip Man 2 was released. Similar to the first film, it was directed by Wilson Yip. In August 2011, while Yen was on a vacation with his family in the United States, he reportedly received an invitation by producer Avi Lerner to star in The Expendables 2. It was stated that Yen was considering the offer, had many films at hand, and would wait until deciding whether the script appealed to him.[22] Later on, Yen revealed to the Hong Kong media that he had rejected the role.[23] In 2011, Yen revealed that he was venturing into other genres of films and had taken up two comedy roles in a row, in All's Well, Ends Well 2011 and All's Well, Ends Well 2012, and would be working with Carina Lau in the former and Sandra Ng in the latter. Both films were critical and box-office successes.
Yen took a six-month break in the second half of 2011 after the filming of The Monkey King, where he portrayed the title character and main protagonist Sun Wukong, replacing Li once again, in which the film was released during the Chinese New Year period in January 2014,[24][25] he explained that he wanted to spend more time with his family and be with his children more as they grew up. In 2012, Yen returned to the movie industry and commenced the filming of Special ID, in which he played the main lead, an undercover cop, and also took on the role of action choreographer. In 2013, it was reported that Yen would be playing the lead role for Iceman, a sci-fi action film dealing with time travel and which was filmed in 3D. Yen confirmed that MMA would be used in both of the aforementioned films.[26]
In February 2013, the Weinstein Company confirmed that it had purchased the rights to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny and contacted Yen to play the male lead. In March 2013, Hong Kong magazines surfaced photos of Harvey and Bob Weinstein traveling to Hong Kong to meet with Yen and persuade him to accept the offer. It was reported that Yen was considering the role and quoted as saying, ""The first is that my schedule this year is very packed. The second is that the first film is already such a classic. I am afraid of the pressure, that the original cannot be surpassed.""[27] In May 2013, during the annual Cannes Film Festival, the Weinstein Company announced that Yen would play the lead role of Silent Wolf in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny, alongside leading female action star Michelle Yeoh reprising her role as Yu Shu Lien, and with director Yuen Woo-ping, Yen's mentor. It was revealed that the movie would be filmed in both English and Mandarin to appeal to the international market.[28] It was revealed during the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II press conference that the Weinstein Company had obtained rights to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, was planning a remake and was negotiating with Yen, George Clooney, and Zhang Ziyi to star in the film.[29][30] Yen declined the offer due to scheduling conflicts for the filming of Ip Man 3. Yen earned HK$220 million (US$28.4 million) from four films and six advertisements in 2013.[31]
In late March 2015, Ip Man 3 was announced. Yen reprised his role as the titular character Ip Man, Bruce Lee's wing chun master. Retired boxer and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was confirmed to join the cast.[32] Yen mentioned that he was a big fan of Tyson, watched many of his professional boxing bouts, and was excited to work with him. Tyson stated during a press conference that he was a huge fan of Yen and has watched Ip Man and Ip Man 2 more than three times each and was honored to be invited for the final installment of the trilogy.[33] Principal photography for Ip Man 3 began on 25 March 2015, and the finished film was released in December 2015 in parts of Asia and around the world in early 2016 to generally favorable reviews.

Yen in February 2018
In 2016, Yen co-starred in the Star Wars anthology film Rogue One as Chirrut Îmwe, the Zatoichi-like blind transient warrior.[34] On 12 February 2016, it was confirmed that Yen would once again replace Li for the third time as Xiang in the upcoming action film XXX: Return of Xander Cage (after Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen in 2010 and The Monkey King in 2014).[35][36][non-primary source needed][37][38] For the promotion of XXX: Return of Xander Cage, Paramount focused marketing efforts on Yen in China and most parts of Asia, placing him at the front of the film posters ahead of Vin Diesel, and shared clips and reviews of Yen's performance in the movie on the popular Chinese social media site Weibo.[39] Paramount's efforts worked very well in China. The film was number one in its opening weekend with $61.9 million,[40] and crossed the $100 million mark in just six days with $22.2m coming from Valentine's Day alone after rave reviews praising Yen's performance swept through Chinese social media, driving moviegoers to the cinema.[41][42] Yen's performance in both Rogue One and XXX: Return of Xander Cage received positive responses from critics and general audiences. For XXX: Return of Xander Cage, media outlets praised Yen's performance.[43][44] In the case of Rogue One, Yen's performance was applauded by audiences worldwide. In a poll on the Star Wars webpage, in which more 40,000 people voted, Yen's character Chirrut Îmwe was voted as audiences' favorite Rogue One character.[45]
While Yen was filming XXX: Return of Xander Cage in Canada, he received offers from Hollywood studios and directors. At the same time, Hong Kong director Wong Jing personally flew to Canada to invite Yen to star in his film Chasing the Dragon, a remake of the film To Be Number One. Yen eventually accepted the offer and played a non-traditional role of a villain with limited fighting scenes and the opportunity to work alongside Andy Lau. In September 2017, Chasing the Dragon was released with positive reviews from critics, citing Yen's versatility as an actor and his portrayal of Ng Sek Ho, the main character of the film.[46] Chasing the Dragon was a hit with audiences in most parts of Asia. In Hong Kong, Chasing the Dragon is ranked as one of the top 5 Hong Kong films in 2017.[47]
In 2017, Yen received a call from Li and Alibaba CEO Jack Ma about a potential collaboration on a short martial arts film known as Gong Shou Dao – to promote a new form of tai chi as an Olympic sport in the future.[48] Yen was on holiday with his wife to celebrate their anniversary, but cancelled his plans to take part in the film. Yen declined any salary for this participation for GSD as he stated that ""friendship is not measured by money"" and that he hopes his participation can help promote Chinese martial arts to worldwide audiences. In return, Li and Ma surprised Yen and his wife Cissy, by helping to celebrate their wedding anniversary on the set. The full GSD 20 minutes short film was released on 11 November – China's Singles' Day, debuting on Youku and Li's official Facebook page, garnering a total of more than 100 million views worldwide.[49][non-primary source needed] Netizens in China praised Yen's speed and technique in the film, with most audiences (over 190,000) voting Yen as the highlight of the short film.[50] In late 2017, Yen began filming Big Brother, a mixed martial arts film where Yen plays a high school teacher with unconventional methods and a dark past.[51]
In 2017, a live-action film adaption of the video game Sleeping Dogs was announced, with Yen playing the lead character Wei Shen.[52] In February 2018, Yen confirmed the continued production of the film through social media.[53] In 2019, Yen reprised his role as Ip Man in Ip Man 4: The Finale. During the Hong Kong protests of that year, protesters urged a boycott of the film, citing the pro-Beijing stances of Yen, co-star Danny Chan, and producer Raymond Wong.[54] The film was a box office success, grossing over three times its budget of $52 million[55][56] and becoming the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time in Malaysia as well as the third-highest-grossing Chinese film in North America in five years.[57][58]

2020s[edit]
In March 2020, as part of the press tour for Disney's live-action remake of Mulan, when Yen was asked by reporters whether he was interested in appearing in a superhero film, Yen revealed that he had been offered a role in Warner Brothers' Justice League and Aquaman films by Zack Snyder, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts. The role offered was that of Nuidis Vulko, which eventually went to Willem Dafoe.[59] Yen joined the cast of John Wick: Chapter 4, which was released in March 2023. Yen and the film both received positive reviews from critics.[60] In May 2024, it was reported that Yen would star in a John Wick spinoff movie around his assassin character Caine.[61][7]

Martial arts history, style and philosophy[edit]
Yen has exemplified his aptitude, expertise, and skill in an array of combat and  martial arts disciplines, being well-versed in Tai Chi, Boxing, Kickboxing, Jeet Kune Do, Hapkido, Mixed Martial Arts, Taekwondo, Karate, Muay Thai, Amateur Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hung Ga, Sanda, Judo, Shaolin Kung Fu, Wudangquan, Wing Chun, and Wushu.[62]
Yen describes himself as a mixed martial artist.[4] He learned Shaolin kung fu and wudangquan at a young age under his mother's tutelage.[63][64] He then wanted to learn Taekwondo in his teenage years, earning a 6th Dan in the process. At the time, the Beijing Wushu Team had a scout in the United States and invited Yen over to Beijing, China, where he began training at the Beijing Sports Institute, the same facility where champion-turned-actor Jet Li trained; this is where the two of them crossed paths for the first time. Upon his return to the United States, Yen won gold medals in various wushu competitions.[65]
Over the course of his life, Yen embarked on a quest to explore and acquire expertise in various other forms of martial arts disciplines; he obtained black and purple belts in Judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, respectively, and went on to study Parkour, Wrestling, Muay Thai, Kickboxing, and Boxing under various instructors. His exposure to the combat sport mixed martial arts (MMA) was heightened when he went back to the United States from 2000 to 2003. While making his Hollywood debut, he also took time off to learn the various martial arts forms in preparation for subsequent and future film roles.[66][67] Yen's progress was evident when he returned to the East Asian film industry, where he implemented his newfound knowledge of MMA, showcased in films such as SPL: Sha Po Lang (2005), Flash Point (2007), and Special ID (2013).
Near the end of 2007, Yen added a new martial arts system to his arsenal. He was offered the role of Wing Chun grandmaster and mentor of film star Bruce Lee, Ip Man, in a 2008 film named after the grandmaster. He worked hard and studied Wing Chun under Ip Man's eldest son, Ip Chun, for 9 months before tackling the role.[68] Ip Chun has since praised Yen for his effort, his skills as a martial artist, and his ability to grasp the full concept of Wing Chun much faster than anyone else he has taught.[69] With the huge success of the Ip Man films both critically and commercially, Yen has been credited by many for contributing to the popularisation of Wing Chun in China.[70][8]
Yen believes that combining many martial arts together produces the most effective and harmonious style. Yen has said, ""When you watch my films, you're feeling my heart.""[71] He believes in practical combat, and in his opinion, MMA is the most authentic type of practical combat.[72]
Yen was a rebel in his youth due to the huge expectations and pressures from his parents, as his mother is the founder of the Chinese Wushu Research Institute in Boston, and his father was a scholar and a musician.[73]
Other martial arts film stars like Jackie Chan and Jet Li have stated that Yen may be the best fighter in terms of practical combat in East Asian cinema.[74][75]
World class fighters, such as former Strikeforce Middleweight Champion Cung Le and former World Boxing Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson, who have worked with Donnie Yen in the films Bodyguards and Assassins and Ip Man 3, respectively, have both claimed that Yen is an incredible martial artist and would do well in authentic combat.[76] While filming Ip Man 3, crew members were worried that Tyson, who had been a professional boxer, would accidentally injure Yen. However, it was ultimately Yen who fractured Tyson's finger while using his elbow to block Tyson's punches.[77] Tyson insisted on finishing the scene before he was treated in hospital.[78]
In 2019, he was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.[79]

Action choreography[edit]
Yen was considered one of the premiere action choreographers in the world, having been invited by Hollywood to choreograph blockbusters such as Blade II, Highlander: Endgame, and Shanghai Knights. Throughout the East Asian cinematic universe, he remained the principal action choreographer for most of his movies and has won multiple awards for his action choreography.
Yen's most famous works include films such as Flash Point and SPL: Sha Po Lang. He has mentioned that the main differences in East Asian styles of filmmaking  and Hollywood are with regards to freedom and control. In the East Asian film industry, the action choreographer takes over the scene during the fight scene. This means that for action scenes filmed in East Asia, the choreographer becomes the director and is in full control over camera placements, camera angles, and the relationship between the drama and the action; therefore the main director is not needed at all. While in Hollywood, on the other hand, Yen explains that the action choreographer simply choreographs the actions with the director, who still maintains full control of such settings and camera angles.[80]
Yen's work as a choreographer won him the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography at the 27th Hong Kong Film Awards and the Golden Horse Award for Best Action Choreography at the 2008 and 2011 Golden Horse Awards.
Yen was the fight choreographer for the 2010 film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen. For this film, Yen mentioned that he included Jeet Kune Do elements as a tribute to the American actor and martial artist Bruce Lee, who played Chen Zhen in the 1972 film Fist of Fury.[81] Furthermore, he incorporated many MMA elements in the film, coupled with the use of Wing Chun. Yen also stated that the concept behind Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do is similar to that of MMA, hence the incorporation of many forms of martial arts was a necessity in the film.[82]
He won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography four times, being one of the most frequent winners of this coveted award. He has won awards for his choreography in films such as The Twins Effect, SPL: Sha Po Lang, Flash Point, and Kung Fu Jungle.[83]

Bodybuilding and transformation for roles[edit]
Donnie Yen regaining his physique in 2016 for XXX: Return of Xander Cage, after losing weight for Ip Man 3 and Rogue One.
Yen is renowned for his physical fitness, strength, and speed achieved through his use of a strict and disciplined fitness regime.[84]
However, despite his muscular build, Yen has gained attention for his dedication to his roles and for the lengths to which he goes to achieve the physical build and appearance of the characters he plays. In 2007, Yen lost over 14 kg (30 pounds) to reach the weight of 54 kg (120 pounds) to better portray the slender Ip Man and the techniques of Wing Chun, which focuses on techniques and not strength.[85] He did so through a very strict regimen of limiting himself to a plain diet consisting mainly of vegetables.[86]
In 2010, still fresh off Ip Man 2, Yen was cast as Chen Zhen in Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen, who was originally portrayed by Bruce Lee. He had to regain his muscular physique for the role and took 6 months through a precise and dedicated diet routine.[87] He maintained this bulk and physique while filming The Lost Bladesman, in which he plays Guan Yu, a Chinese general known for his size and spear-fighting abilities.[88]
In 2015, Yen reduced his muscular physique yet again to reprise the role of Ip Man in Ip Man 3 and for his role as the blind warrior monk Chirrut Îmwe in Rogue One.[89] For his role as Xiang in XXX: Return of Xander Cage opposite Vin Diesel, Yen rebuilt his physique.[90][non-primary source needed]

Personal life[edit]
Yen met his first wife, Hong Kong advertising executive Leung Zing-ci (Chinese: 梁靜慈), in 1990. They began dating in 1990. After three years of dating, they married secretly in the United States in November 1993. The marriage ended in less than a year. After their divorce was finalized, Leung realized that she was pregnant with their son, Jeff, who was born in 1995.[91][92]
Yen married former beauty queen Cissy Wang after three months of dating in 2003. The couple have two children, Jasmine and James.[91]
Yen has stated that he is a big fan of the MMA organization Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and has watched almost every UFC event available. In various interviews, he has mentioned that he would have loved to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship if he did not have a recurring shoulder injury.[93]

Philanthropic work[edit]
In 2012, Yen and his wife Cissy co-founded Go.Asia, an online charity platform encouraging people to participate in charity work and serve local communities.[94]
In October 2014, Yen was invited to be a guest speaker in front of a crowd of 20,000 youths for We Day Vancouver, where he spoke about the hardships he faced growing up and how he overcame difficulties.[95]
In 2015, Yen visited refugee camps in Thailand, bringing donations and gifts for the refugees.[96] Yen is an ambassador for the international charity Save the Children.
In December 2015, Yen established a charitable fund, Yen's Honour Protection Fund, with the purpose of empowering celebrities to use the law to defend their honor and reputation. Yen said the fund ""[seeks] to assist and render help to everyone who needs it, most importantly to heal and repair the hearts and dignities which have been affected."" This fund was established after Yen won a lawsuit against Geng Weiguo (AKA Tan Bing), who defamed Yen and hired netizens to threaten Yen's family.[97]
In February 2020, in light of the coronavirus pandemic in China and the rest of the world, Yen stepped in to donate HK$1 million to frontline medical workers in Wuhan. He also produced and dedicated a short clip to thank all medical workers in China in their fight against the coronavirus; the clip was uploaded on Chinese social media site Weibo, where Yen has over 11 million followers. He donated a painting done by himself and his two children, to the frontline medical workers.[98]

Politics[edit]
In 2023, Yen was appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a representative of the ""Literature and Arts"" sector, replacing outgoing fellow action star Jackie Chan.[99] He stated that he was a Chinese patriot and requested that his film roles in Hollywood must positively represent the Chinese.[100]
Yen said of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests that ""It wasn't a protest [...] it was a riot.""[101][102]

Uvs Nuur Basin
The Uvs Nuur Basin (1,068,853 ha), is the northernmost of the enclosed basins of Central Asia. It takes its name from Uvs Nuur Lake, a large, shallow and very saline lake, important for migrating birds, waterfowl and seabirds. The site is made up of twelve protected areas representing the major biomes of eastern Eurasia. The steppe ecosystem supports a rich diversity of birds and the desert is home to a number of rare gerbil, jerboas and the marbled polecat. The mountains are an important refuge for the globally endangered snow leopard, mountain sheep (argali) and the Asiatic ibex.

Bassin d’Ubs Nuur
Le Bassin d’Ubs Nuur, qui couvre une surface de plus de un million d’hectares, est le bassin fermé le plus septentrional d’Asie centrale. Il tire son nom de l’Ubs Nuur, un grand lac peu profond et très salé, qui joue un rôle important dans la vie des oiseaux migrateurs, tant aquatiques que marins. Le site, divisé en douze aires protégées, comprend une vaste gamme d’écosystèmes qui représentent les principaux biomes de l’Eurasie orientale. L’écosystème steppique entretient une riche diversité d’oiseaux et le désert un certain nombre de gerbilles, gerboises et putois marbrés rares. Les montagnes sont d’importants refuges pour le léopard des neiges (une espèce menacée), l’argali et le bouquetin d’Asie.

Убсунурская котловина 
Объект наследия (площадью 1069 тыс. га) находится в границах самой северной из всех бессточных котловин Центральной Азии. Его наименование происходит от названия обширного мелководного и очень соленого озера Убсунур, в районе которого скапливается масса перелетных, водоплавающих и околоводных птиц. Объект состоит из 12 разрозненных участков (в т.ч. в России семь участков, площадью 258,6 тыс. га), которые представляют все основные типы ландшафтов, характерных для Восточной Евразии. В степях отмечено большое разнообразие пернатых, а на пустынных участках обитают редкие виды мелких млекопитающих. В высокогорной части отмечены такие животные, редкие в глобальном масштабе, как снежный барс и горный баран аргали, а также сибирский козерог.

Poco profundo y muy salado, este lago desempeña un papel muy importante en la vida de las aves migratorias, tanto fluviales y lacustres como marinas. El sitio está dividido en doce zonas protegidas y posee una amplia gama de ecosistemas representativos de los principales biomas de Eurasia Oriental. El ecosistema estepario alberga una gran variedad de aves y en las zonas desérticas viven jerbos, jerbillos y una especie rara de turones jaspeados. Las zonas montañosas sirven de refugio a una especie en peligro de extinción, el leopardo de las nieves, así como a ovejas montesas (argalis) e íbices asiáticos.

Uvs Nuur bekken
Het Uvs Nuur bekken (1.068.853 hectare) is het meest noordelijke ingesloten bekken van Centraal-Azië. Het ontleent zijn naam aan het Uvs Nuur meer, een groot, ondiep en erg zout meer, dat van belang is voor trekvogels, watervogels en zeevogels. Het bekken bestaat uit twaalf beschermde gebieden die representatief zijn voor de grote biomen (ecosystemen) van oostelijk Eurazië. Het steppe ecosysteem heeft een rijke verscheidenheid aan vogels en de woestijn vormt het woongebied van de zeldzame gerbil, springmuizen en de gemarmerde bunzing. De bergen zijn een belangrijk toevluchtsoord voor het wereldwijd bedreigde sneeuwluipaard, bergschapen (argali) en Aziatische steenbokken.

Outstanding Universal Value
Brief synthesis
Shared by Mongolia and the Republic of Tuva in the Russian Federation, Uvs Nuur Basin is a transnational World Heritage property in the heart of Asia. The serial property comprises seven components in Mongolia and five in the Republic of Tuva, clustered around the shallow and highly saline Lake Uvs Nuur. Some components are contiguous with each other across the international border, while others are distinct units. Inscribed in 2003 on the World Heritage List, the total surface area is close to 898,064 ha, of which 87,830 ha belong to the cluster in the Russian Federation, with 810,234 ha belonging to the Mongolian cluster. The central Uvs Nuur Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia covers almost half of the surface area of the entire property. While no buffer zones were formally recognized during the inscription of the property for its components on the Mongolian side, five of the seven components within the Russian Federation have buffer zones, totalling 170,790 ha.  
The ancient lake basin and its surroundings boast an extraordinary landscape diversity ranging from cold desert to desert-steppe and steppe, conifer, deciduous and floodplain forests to diverse wetlands and marshlands, freshwater and saltwater systems, mobile and fixed sand dunes and even tundra. The property includes peaks up to some 4000 m.a.s.l., towering high above Lake Uvs Nuur at around 800 m.a.s.l. The property contains remnant glaciers from Pleistocene ice sheets and numerous glacial lakes, and is of particular scientific significance for studying the evolution from the Ice Age to present-day conditions. Reflecting the landscape diversity, there is a rich species diversity which includes locally endemic plants and endangered species like the snow leopard. The entire basin has never been subjected to large-scale resource exploitation and has a longstanding and ongoing history of mobile pastoralism. The historical, cultural and spiritual importance of the landscape and many of its features are reflected in countless artefacts and archaeological sites and in the contemporary life, knowledge, resource use, songs and legends of local and indigenous communities.
Criterion (ix): The remote and enclosed salt lake system of Uvs Nuur with its high degree of naturalness is of international scientific importance due to its large-scale undisturbed climatic, hydrological and ecological processes and phenomena. Because of the relatively stable past and contemporary pastoral use of the grasslands and the absence of conversion or major human impacts over thousands of years, it constitutes a unique field site for a great variety of subjects, including research into the ongoing development of Uvs Nuur and other smaller lakes within the basin, and the still intact processes of long term lake salinisation and eutrophication. In addition to important past and current research efforts on both sides of the border and in recognition of its unique geophysical and biological characteristics, the Uvs Nuur Basin has also been selected as a field site for the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGPB), a global effort to monitor and understand global change.
Criterion (x): The serial property conserves the most valuable areas representing the much larger Uvs Nuur Basin, across an enormous range of ecosystems and habitats, including along a major altitudinal gradient. The diversity represents the major biomes of Central Asia with a corresponding floral and faunal diversity. There are important areas of different forest types and highly specialized vegetation in high altitudes, tundra systems and dry land ecosystems, including species and communities adapted to saline conditions. The more than 550 higher plants include relict species and a number of plants endemic to Mongolia and the Tuva Republic, with five species endemic to the lake basin. The various ecosystems support a rich faunal diversity, such as the argali sheep, Siberian ibex, Pallas's cat and the elusive and globally endangered snow leopard. The numerous rodents are of major ecological importance and include two vulnerable jerboa species and gerbil. The many ecological niches are occupied by an impressive density of breeding raptors. The property is also of major importance for waterfowl, as well as a stepping stone in the bird migration between Siberia and wintering ranges in China and South Asia.
Integrity 
The Uvs Nuur Basin is a naturally diverse and simultaneously distinct landscape unit surrounded by several large and high mountain ranges. To the North, the basin transitions into the Tannu-Ola Range, to the East are the Sangilen and Bolnai Ranges; to the West the Tsagaan Shuvuut and Shapshaskee Ranges constitute natural boundaries, while the Turgen Uul and Hanhohee Ranges are adjacent to the South. All components and the zoning were selected considering biodiversity at all levels, connectivity and overall integrity. There are excellent opportunities to manage the basin at the landscape level across national boundaries of the property protected by the World Heritage Convention. However, it is important to understand the large scale of the basin, of which only a small part is protected and recognized as a World Heritage property. Mobile herders have been coexisting with the diverse flora and fauna in harsh environmental conditions for thousands of years without degrading the productivity, resilience and diversity of the basin. However, under changed and changing macroeconomic and political circumstances, there are concerns about poaching, illegal logging and overgrazing in certain areas of the basin, likely to affect the integrity of the property in the long term.
Protection and management requirements
The Uvs Nuur Basin transnational World Heritage property is formally protected public land in its entirety in both countries. All components are protected under the highest levels of the national law of both concerned countries, the Laws on Special Protected Areas (1994) and on Buffer Zones (1998) in the case of Mongolia and the Federal Law on Special Protected Areas (1995) in the Russian Federation. This includes the Mongolian Tes River component, the status of which was upgraded in response to the inscription decision by the World Heritage Committee. Much of the land of the contemporary protected areas overlaps with traditionally sacred mountains, lakes, rivers and other revered landscape features. The property is not only an excellent example of cooperation in the conservation of a shared ecosystem across an international boundary but also of cooperation between governmental, scientific and non-governmental institutions. Several bilateral agreements at the level of the responsible ministries and the protected area administrations formally underpin cooperation and joint management planning. Border Protection staff assists in the protection of the property on a permanent basis on both sides of the border. Environmental education and information activities further support the conservation of the property.
Building upon existing involvement of local and indigenous communities, it is envisaged to promote the World Heritage property as a model of integrated and sustainable conservation and development. One important entry point is the acknowledgement and revitalization of traditional conservation beliefs. Given the longstanding interaction between livestock, wildlife and vegetation, mobile herding is an integral element of the contemporary ecosystem. However, herding is not sustainable per se, as overgrazing can result in erosion and reduced productivity of the grasslands at the expense of livestock, wildlife and people. As elsewhere in the region, there are signs of mounting pressure on pastures, forests and wildlife, as well as increasing occurrence of fires. The main challenge for the future of the property and the wider Uvs Nuur Basin will be to maintain the balance between use and conservation at the landscape level, including but not limited to the twelve components of the property. The control of illegal activities in the property, such as poaching and illegal logging, requires adequate equipment, staffing, and funding of law enforcement, as well as transboundary cooperation on a permanent basis. Research has an important role to play in terms of better understanding the ecology and cultural heritage of the basin in order to accompany conservation and management.

 "
What was accomplished during the Camp David Accords?,"The Camp David Accords, signed in 1978, was a diplomatic agreement between Egypt and Israel, two of the Middle East's most politically volatile countries. The agreement was a significant accomplishment because it led to a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, a country that had been at war for decades.

The Camp David Accords were the result of several years of negotiations between President Jimmy Carter and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The agreement was signed in a series of secret meetings at Camp David, a presidential retreat in Maryland, in September 1978.

The Camp David Accords were significant because they led to the normalization of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Israel, which had been at odds since Israel's founding in 1948. The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, signed in March 1979, was the first peace treaty in the Middle East in over 30 years.

The Camp David Accords also led to several other significant developments in the region. For example, the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty led to the release of hostages held by both countries, including the release of the American hostages held in Iran. The peace treaty also led to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Jordan, which had been at odds since the 1950s.

The Camp David Accords also had a significant impact on the United States. The agreement was seen as a symbol of American leadership in the Middle East and helped to improve the country's reputation in the region. The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel was also seen as a significant achievement for the Jewish community in the United States, as it helped to promote understanding and cooperation between Jews and Arabs.

In conclusion, the Camp David Accords was a significant diplomatic achievement that led to the normalization of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Israel. The agreement helped to promote understanding and cooperation between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East and had a significant impact on the United States and the Jewish community in the country.",True,https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/camp-david,"

Camp David Accords and the Arab-Israeli Peace Process
The Camp David Accords, signed by President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian President
                    Anwar Sadat, and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in September 1978,
                    established a framework for a historic peace treaty concluded between Israel and
                    Egypt in March 1979. President Carter and the U.S. Government played leading
                    roles in creating the opportunity for this agreement to occur. From the start of
                    his administration, Carter and his Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, pursued
                    intensive negotiations with Arab and Israeli leaders, hoping to reconvene the
                    Geneva Conference, which had been established in December 1973 to seek an end to
                    the Arab-Israeli dispute.

As Carter and Vance met with individual leaders from Arab countries and Israel
                    during the spring of 1977, negotiations for a return to Geneva appeared to gain
                    some momentum. On May 17, 1977, an Israeli election upset stunned the Carter
                    administration as the moderate Israeli Labor Party lost for the first time in
                    Israel’s history. Menachem Begin, the leader of the conservative Likud Party and
                    the new Israeli Prime Minister, appeared intractable on the issue of exchanging
                    land for peace. His party’s commitment to “greater Israel” left Carter with an
                    even more challenging situation during the summer of 1977.
In addition to the new reality of a Likud government in Israel, long-standing
                    rivalries among Arab leaders also played a role in blocking substantive progress
                    in negotiations for a Geneva conference. By early November, Egyptian President
                    Sadat found himself frustrated by the lack of movement and made a dramatic move,
                    announcing on November 9 that he would be willing to go to Jerusalem. This move
                    stunned the world. Sadat would attempt to break the deadlock and to engage the
                    Israelis directly for a Middle East settlement, eschewing any talk of returning
                    to the Geneva Conference. Sadat’s visit led to direct talks between Egypt and
                    Israel that December, but these talks did not generate substantive progress. By
                    January 1978, the United States returned to a more prominent negotiation
                    role.
During the spring and early summer of 1978, the United States attempted to find
                    common ground with regard to Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai, West Bank, and
                    Gaza. Egypt insisted on an Israeli withdrawal to June 4, 1967 borders in
                    exchange for security arrangements and minor border modifications. Israel
                    rejected Egypt’s insistence on withdrawal, especially from the West Bank and
                    Gaza. It argued instead for some form of Palestinian autonomy during a five-year
                    interim period followed by the possibility of sovereignty after the interim
                    period expired. The impasse over the West Bank and Gaza led Carter to intercede
                    directly in an attempt to resolve the deadlock.
By July 30, as Sadat expressed disappointment over the progress of negotiations
                    and a desire to cut direct contacts off with the Israelis, Carter decided to
                    call for a summit meeting. This meeting would bring Sadat, Begin, and Carter
                    together at the presidential retreat in Maryland at Camp David. On August 8, the
                    White House spokesman formally announced the meeting, which both Begin and Sadat
                    agreed to attend in September.
The Camp David Summit, held from September 5–17, 1978, was a pivotal moment both
                    in the history of the Arab-Israeli dispute and U.S. diplomacy. Rarely had a U.S.
                    President devoted as much sustained attention to a single foreign policy issue
                    as Carter did over the summit’s two-week duration. Carter’s ambitious goals for
                    the talks included breaking the negotiating deadlock and hammering out a
                    detailed Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement. To this end, U.S. Middle East experts
                    produced a draft treaty text, which served as the basis for the negotiations and
                    would be revised numerous times during the Summit. The talks proved extremely
                    challenging, especially when the trilateral format became impossible to sustain.
                    Instead, Carter and Vance met with the Egyptian and Israeli delegations
                    individually over the course of the next twelve days.
The talks ranged over a number of issues, including the future of Israeli
                    settlements and airbases in the Sinai Peninsula, but it was Gaza and the West
                    Bank that continued to pose the most difficulty. Specifically, the delegations
                    were divided over the applicability of United Nations Security Council
                    Resolution 242 to a long-term agreement in the territories, as well as the
                    status of Israel’s settlements during projected negotiations on Palestinian
                    autonomy that would follow a peace treaty. In the end, while the Summit did not
                    produce a formal peace agreement, it successfully produced the basis for an Egyptian-Israeli peace, in the form of two “Framework”
                    documents, which laid out the principles of a bilateral peace agreement as well
                    as a formula for Palestinian self-government in Gaza and the West Bank.
While the conclusion of the Camp David Accords represented significant progress,
                    the process of translating the Framework documents into a formal peace treaty
                    proved daunting. As with the Summit, Carter’s hopes for rapid progress were
                    high, and the President hoped that a treaty text would be concluded in a matter
                    of days. However, the controversy that developed between the Carter
                    administration and the Begin government over the duration of an agreed freeze in
                    the construction of Israeli settlements was quickly followed by the
                    administration’s failure to win support from Jordan or Saudi Arabia for the
                    Accords. Beginning in October, a series of talks in Washington broke down as a
                    result of Israeli concerns over the timing of their withdrawal and Egyptian
                    reservations regarding the impact of a peace treaty on its obligations to other
                    Arab states. Other regional developments, especially the Iranian Revolution,
                    distracted U.S. policymakers and raised Israeli concerns about its oil supply,
                    resulting in an impasse during the winter of 1978–1979. After Begin’s visit to
                    the White House in early March failed to break the stalemate, Carter traveled to
                    Israel on March 10. Having previously secured Sadat’s consent to negotiate on
                    behalf of Egypt, the President engaged in three days of intensive talks with the
                    Israelis. As a result of a series of compromises, notably a U.S. guarantee of
                    Israel’s oil supply, omitting references to a “special role” for Egypt in Gaza,
                    and Israeli agreement to make a number of unilateral gestures to the
                    Palestinians, the U.S. and Israeli delegations agreed to a treaty text on March
                    13. Sadat quickly assented to the agreement and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace
                    Treaty was formally signed on March 26.
Although a landmark event, the successful conclusion of the Egyptian-Israeli
                    Treaty represented the high-water mark for the Peace Process during the Carter
                    Presidency. After March 1979, the issue would not receive the same level of U.S.
                    attention due to the competing demands of crises, especially those in Iran and
                    Afghanistan, as well as Carter’s desire to reduce his personal involvement in
                    the next round of negotiations devoted to Palestinian autonomy. For those talks,
                    Carter appointed a “special negotiator” to represent the United States; former
                    Special Trade Representative Robert Strauss served in this role briefly before
                    being replaced in the fall of 1979 by Sol Linowitz, who had previously helped
                    negotiate the Panama Canal treaty. The talks failed to produce much as
                    Palestinian representatives refused to participate, and the gap between Egyptian
                    and Israeli positions on Palestinian self-government, not to mention their
                    respective stances on Israeli settlements in Gaza and the West Bank and the
                    legal status of East Jerusalem, proved unbridgeable.

The Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park is a national park located in northwest Madagascar. It is mainly within the boundaries of Antsalova District, with a small part in the northeast falling within Morafenobe District. The national park centers on two geological formations: the Great Tsingy and the Little Tsingy. Together with the adjacent Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve, the National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[2][3]
It is crossed by the Manambolo River.


Geology[edit]
Satellite image of the park.
The Tsingys are karstic plateaus in which groundwater has undercut the elevated uplands, and has gouged caverns and fissures into the limestone. In several regions on western Madagascar, centering on the park and adjacent Nature Reserve, the superposition of vertical and horizontal erosion patterns has created dramatic ""forests"" of limestone needles.[2]
The word tsingy is indigenous to the Malagasy language as a description of the karst badlands of Madagascar. The word can be translated into English as where one cannot walk barefoot.[3]

Biology[edit]
The unusual geomorphology of the Tsingy de Bemaraha World Heritage Site, which encompasses both the National Park and the adjacent Strict Nature Reserve, means that the Site is home to an exceptionally large number of endemic species of plants and animals[4] that are found only within extremely small niches within the tsingys. For example, the summit, slope, and base of a tsingy's limestone needle form different ecosystems with different species clinging to their exceptionally steep slopes.[3]

What is the significance of the Lonesome George?,"Lonesome George, the last living Pinta Island giant tortoise, was an important figure in the conservation world. He was a symbol of the importance of protecting endangered species and the need for urgent action to prevent the extinction of species.

The George expedition, which was named after him, was a scientific expedition that was launched to find Lonesome George and collect samples of his DNA. The expedition was led by a conservationist named Dr. George Schaller, who was also the head of the George expedition.

The George expedition was successful in finding Lonesome George, and they were able to collect his DNA. They also collected samples of his blood and tissue, which were used for scientific research.

The George expedition was also a public relations campaign, which was aimed at raising awareness about the importance of protecting endangered species. The expedition was featured in the media, and it helped to bring attention to the plight of the giant tortoise and the need for urgent action to prevent its extinction.

The George expedition was also a scientific expedition, which was aimed at studying the ecology of the island and the giant tortoise population. The expedition was able to collect data on the population size, age structure, and distribution of the giant tortoise population.

In conclusion, Lonesome George was an important figure in the conservation world, and his expedition was a significant event in the history of conservation. His expedition helped to raise awareness about the importance of protecting endangered species and the need for urgent action to prevent their extinction.",False,https://www.galapagos.org/about_galapagos/lonesome-george/,"

Lonesome George 
















Lonesome George 




 Lonesome George on Pinta Island in 1972 © Ole Hamann





On June 24th, 2012, Lonesome George — the sole remaining Pinta Island tortoise and Galapagos conservation icon — was found dead in his corral at the Tortoise Breeding and Rearing Center in Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island, by members of the Galapagos National Park Service. His loss will be felt across the world, as it marks the extinction of the Pinta species of tortoise.Lonesome George, a giant tortoise from the island of Pinta in the northern regions of the Galapagos Archipelago, was the last known survivor of the Pinta tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdoni). He was considered one of the rarest creature in the world and became a conservation icon. As throughout the rest of the islands, Pinta tortoises were over-exploited by whalers, fur sealers, and others in the 1800s. The first potential landfall heading into the islands and the last possible landfall heading home again, Pinta was probably a much used source of tortoises, thus reducing the population to near zero. The Pinta tortoise was thought to be extinct in the early part of the 20th century. Except for the absence of giant tortoises, the island was in near pristine condition until 1959, when fishermen released three goats there. Given the distance to Pinta from port, these fishermen simply wanted fresh meat on their long fishing voyages. The tiny goat population, however, exploded, and by 1970 it was estimated to be around 40,000. The goats had devastated the vegetation and had essentially eliminated any good tortoise habitat left.Then in 1971, József Vágvölgyi, a Hungarian scientist studying snails on Pinta saw a tortoise on the island – Lonesome George. Vágvölgyi recounted his observation back in port, and in the spring of 1972, Galapagos National Park rangers brought the tortoise to the Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz for its protection. The hope was that a female Pinta tortoise would eventually be found – in one of the zoos around the world or perhaps even on Pinta – and Lonesome George would have a breeding partner. Despite extensive searches and genetic analyses of any potential Pinta tortoise found in zoos, none has been located to this day. Within a short time, the discovery of a Pinta tortoise was big news. The American media began to refer to the tortoise as Lonesome George – after George Gobel, a TV comedian, who had become known himself as Lonesome George. The name stuck.Lonesome George was in relatively good health and his age was estimated at over 100 years old at the time of his passing.  Unlike the other tortoises in the center however, George became severely overweight.  At the end of the 1980s it became apparent that George had to go on a diet. Since that time, veterinarians and nutritionists examined him periodically and personnel of the center continued to implement their recommendations. In 1992, a new corral with nesting sites was built for George where he could be observed by visitors. At the same time, two females (C. becki) from Wolf Volcano on northern Isabela were brought to the Tortoise Center to accompany him. Based on morphology, the Wolf Volcano population seemed to be the most similar to Pinta tortoises. More recent genetic analyses have shown that this was incorrect. Pinta tortoises are actually most closely related to the Española tortoise (C. hoodensis).  George shared his corral with two first generation Española tortoises, both produced in the Española breeding program, but Lonesome George produced no offspring.     In the late 1990s, Pinta became a training ground for Project Isabela. The last goat was finally eliminated and Pinta was declared “goat free” in 2003. Project Pinta, aimed at the restoration of the island in part through the return of giant tortoises is ongoing today.In the last two decades, a team of scientists from a number of institutions led by researchers in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Yale University have been studying the genetics of Galapagos giant tortoises. Among their many exciting findings was the occurrence of an occasional hybrid tortoise on Wolf Volcano with half or less Pinta ancestry.  While no pure Pinta tortoises have been found, these hybrid Pinta tortoises may help in the plan to restore tortoises to Pinta. “Whatever happens to this single animal, let him always remind us that the fate of all living things on Earth is in human hands.”— These words are inscribed on the information panel outside the enclosure of Lonesome George at CDRS/GNP.Lonesome George in his corral at the Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz Island.Early on Sunday morning, June 24, 2012, Lonesome George, the sole remaining Pinta Island tortoise and Galapagos conservation icon, was found dead in his corral at the Tortoise Breeding and Rearing Center in Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island. Fausto Llerena, a Galapagos National Park ranger who was on the expedition that discovered George and who was his long-term caretaker, found George stretched out in the direction of his watering hole with no signs of life.Possible causes of death of George will not be known until after a necropsy.  The body of Lonesome George, whose age is unknown but estimated at more than 100 years old, is currently being held in a cold chamber to avoid decomposition prior to a necropsy.According to Johannah Barry, Galapagos Conservancy’s President, “George symbolized the precarious state of biodiversity around the world. He was a catalyst for extraordinary efforts of the Ecuadorian government and an international network of scientists and conservationists who have undertaken efforts restore tortoise populations and to improve the status of other endangered and threatened species in the archipelago. He also became a symbol of the tremendous advances that can be made when science, conservation expertise and political will are aligned on a common cause.”Lonesome George’s empty corral, his home for the past 40 years.By coincidence, both Johannah Barry and Linda Cayot, GC’s Science Advisor, were in Galapagos at the time of George’s death to participate in an international workshop, partially funded by Galapagos Conservancy and convened by the Galapagos National Park Service, to develop management strategies for the restoration of tortoise populations across Galapagos during the next ten years.“This event will bring together top experts from around the world to make sure that we capitalize on recent advances in genetics analysis and ecosystem restoration,” explained Edwin Naula. “We will conduct this workshop in honor of Lonesome George.”Lonesome George’s legacy will be an increased awareness of the importance of biodiversity protection and heightened efforts in both research and management to restore his island of Pinta and all of the other giant tortoise populations of Galapagos. Lonesome George In The News: 15 September 2015: Lonesome George to be Unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History12 March 2013: Lonesome George Arrives in New York15 November 2012: Lonesome George’s Genetic Legacy Survives25 June 2012: Lonesome George will be Preserved in a New Tortoise Interpretation Center24 June 2012: The World Loses Lonesome George21 Jan 2012: Galapagos National Park Service gives Lonesome George new female companions

What is the significance of the Tesla coil?,"The Tesla coil is a highly significant invention in the field of electrical engineering. It was invented by the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and it has had a significant impact on the development of radio, television, and other forms of modern communication.

The Tesla coil is a high-frequency transformer that generates a high-voltage, low-current alternating current (AC) electrical discharge. It consists of a primary coil, a secondary coil, and a resonant circuit. The primary coil is energized by a high-voltage AC source, and the energy is transferred to the secondary coil through a transformer. The secondary coil generates an alternating voltage that is proportional to the number of turns in the coil.

One of the most significant early uses of the Tesla coil was in the development of radio communication. In the early 20th century, the Tesla coil was used to transmit radio signals over long distances, allowing for the development of radio broadcasting and other forms of wireless communication.

The Tesla coil was also used in the development of television. In the 1920s and 1930s, Tesla coils were used to generate high-frequency electrical discharges that were used to modulate the amplitude and phase of a radio signal, creating a visible image on a screen. This technology was used to develop the first television systems, which were used to broadcast live events and other forms of entertainment.

The Tesla coil has also been used in the development of communication satellites. In the late 20th century, Tesla coils were used to generate high-frequency electrical discharges that were used to transmit signals over long distances, allowing for the development of communication satellites.

Overall, the Tesla coil has had a significant impact on the development of radio, television, and other forms of modern communication. Its ability to generate high-frequency electrical discharges has allowed for the development of new technologies and the expansion of communication networks around the world.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8tch3o/what_purposefunction_do_tesla_coils_serve_other/,"You've been blocked by network security.To continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer tokenIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.Log in File a ticket"
What is the Oldowan tool industry?,"The Oldowan tool industry is a prehistoric tool-making industry that is characterized by the creation of simple, crude stone tools for the purpose of breaking open hard-shelled nuts and seeds. The Oldowan tool industry is believed to have originated around 2.5 million years ago in East Africa, and it is considered to be the earliest known tool-making industry in the world.

The Oldowan tool industry is named after Olduvai Gorge, where it was first discovered and studied by the anthropologist Louis Leakey. The Oldowan tool industry is characterized by the use of simple, crude stone tools, such as hammerstones, flakes, and core tools, which were created by striking flakes off of larger pieces of rock. These tools were used primarily for the purpose of breaking open hard-shelled nuts and seeds, and they were not designed for any specific purpose beyond this.

The Oldowan tool industry is believed to have been developed by early hominids, such as Homo habilis, who were adapting to the changing environment and needed tools for basic survival. The Oldowan tool industry is considered to be a significant milestone in the development of human technology, as it represents the earliest known example of tool-making and the beginning of the use of tools for specific purposes.

Some specific details and examples of the Oldowan tool industry include:

* The Oldowan tool industry is believed to have originated around 2.5 million years ago in East Africa, and it is considered to be the earliest known tool-making industry in the world.
* The Oldowan tool industry is named after Olduvai Gorge, where it was first discovered and studied by the anthropologist Louis Leakey.
* The Oldowan tool industry is characterized by the use of simple, crude stone tools, such as hammerstones, flakes, and core tools, which were created by striking flakes off of larger pieces of rock.
* The Oldowan tool industry was primarily used for the purpose of breaking open hard-shelled nuts and seeds, and it was not designed for any specific purpose beyond this.
* The Oldowan tool industry is believed to have been developed by early hominids, such as Homo habilis, who were adapting to the changing environment and needed tools for basic survival.
* The Oldowan tool industry is considered to be a significant milestone in the development of human technology, as it represents the earliest known example of tool-making and the beginning of the use of tools for specific purposes.

It's worth noting that the Oldowan tool industry is not the only tool-making industry that existed during the Paleolithic period, and there were other tool-making industries that developed later on. The Oldowan tool industry, however, is considered to be the earliest known tool-making industry in the world and it's a significant milestone in the development of human technology.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldowan,"

↓ Mesolithicvte
The Oldowan (or Mode I) was a widespread stone tool archaeological industry (style) in prehistory. These early tools were simple, usually made by chipping one, or a few, flakes off a stone using another stone.  Oldowan tools were used during the Lower Paleolithic period, 2.9 million years ago up until at least 1.7 million years ago (Ma), by ancient Hominins (early humans) across much of Africa. This technological industry was followed by the more sophisticated Acheulean industry (two sites associated with Homo erectus at Gona in the Afar Region of Ethiopia dating from 1.5 and 1.26 million years ago have both Oldowan and Acheulean tools[2]).
The term Oldowan is taken from the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where the first Oldowan stone tools were discovered by the archaeologist Louis Leakey in the 1930s. However, some contemporary archaeologists and palaeoanthropologists prefer to use the term Mode 1 tools to designate pebble tool industries (including Oldowan), with Mode 2 designating bifacially worked tools (including Acheulean handaxes), Mode 3 designating prepared-core tools, and so forth.[3]
Classification of Oldowan tools is still somewhat contentious. Mary Leakey was the first to create a system to classify Oldowan assemblages, and built her system based on prescribed use. The system included choppers, scrapers, and pounders.[4][5] However, more recent classifications of Oldowan assemblages have been made that focus primarily on manufacture due to the problematic nature of assuming use from stone artefacts. An example is Isaac et al.'s tri-modal categories of ""Flaked Pieces"" (cores/choppers), ""Detached Pieces"" (flakes and fragments), ""Pounded Pieces"" (cobbles utilized as hammerstones, etc.) and ""Unmodified Pieces"" (manuports, stones transported to sites).[6] Oldowan tools are sometimes called ""pebble tools"", so named because the blanks chosen for their production already resemble, in pebble form, the final product.[7]
It is not known for sure which hominin species created and used Oldowan tools. Its emergence is often associated with the species Australopithecus garhi[8] and its flourishing with early species of Homo such as H. habilis and H. ergaster. Early Homo erectus appears to inherit Oldowan technology and refines it into the Acheulean industry beginning 1.7 million years ago.[9]


Dates and ranges[edit]
The oldest known Oldowan tools have been found at Nyayanga on the Homa Peninsula in Kenya and are dated to ~2.9 million years ago (Ma).[10] The Oldowan tools were associated with Paranthropus teeth and two butchered hippo skeletons.[10] Early Oldowan tools are also known from Gona in Ethiopia (near the Awash River), and are dated to about 2.6 Ma.[11]
The use of tools by apes including chimpanzees[12] and orangutans[13] can be used to argue in favour of tool-use as an ancestral feature of the hominin family.[14] Tools made from bone, wood, or other organic materials were therefore in all probability used before the Oldowan.[15] Oldowan stone tools are simply the oldest recognisable tools which have been preserved in the archaeological record.[16]
There is a flourishing of Oldowan tools in eastern Africa, spreading to southern Africa, between 2.4 and 1.7 Ma. At 1.7 Ma., the first Acheulean tools appear even as Oldowan assemblages continue to be produced. Both technologies are occasionally found in the same areas, dating to the same time periods. This realisation required a rethinking of old cultural sequences in which the more ""advanced"" Acheulean was supposed to have succeeded the Oldowan. The different traditions may have been used by different species of hominins living in the same area, or multiple techniques may have been used by an individual species in response to different circumstances.
Sometime before 1.8 Ma Homo erectus had spread outside of Africa, reaching as far east as Java by 1.8 Ma[17] and in Northern China by 1.66 Ma.[18] In these newly colonised areas, no Acheulean assemblages have been found. In China, only ""Mode 1"" Oldowan assemblages were produced, while in Indonesia stone tools from this age are unknown.
By 1.8 Ma early Homo was present in Europe, as shown by the discovery of fossil remains and Oldowan tools in Dmanisi, Georgia.[19] Remains of their activities have also been excavated in Spain at sites in the Guadix-Baza basin[20] and near Atapuerca.[21] Most early European sites yield ""Mode 1"" or Oldowan assemblages. The earliest Acheulean sites in Europe only appear around 0.5 Ma. In addition, the Acheulean tradition does not seem to spread to Eastern Asia.[22] It is unclear from the archaeological record when the production of Oldowan technologies ended. Other tool-making traditions seem to have supplanted Oldowan technologies by 0.25 Ma.
The discovery of stone tools that predate the Oldowan, dated to as early as 3.3 Ma, at the Lomekwi site in Kenya, was announced in 2015.[23]
This age pre-dates the current estimates for the age of the genus Homo by half a million years, and would fall into the pre-human period, 
associated with the direct australopithecine ancestors of genus Homo. It is not clear whether the tools of such a ""Lomekwian industry"" bear any relation to the Oldowan industry.[24]

Manufacture[edit]
There are articles that address how some Oldowan tools may have been found as stones with naturally occurring shapes that dictate their ideal use, or formed as such.[25] To form the general shape of an Oldowan tool, a roughly spherical hammerstone is struck on the edge, or striking platform, of a suitable core rock to produce a conchoidal fracture with sharp edges useful for various purposes. The process is often called lithic reduction. The chip removed by the blow is the flake. Some of these flakes can be used as tools, provided the aforementioned conditions for the initial stone are met before modification.[26] Below the point of impact on the core is a characteristic bulb with fine fissures on the fracture surface. The flake evidences ripple marks.
The materials of the tools were for the most part quartz, quartzite, basalt, or obsidian, and later flint and chert. Any rock that can hold an edge will do. The main source of these rocks is river cobbles, which provide both hammer stones and striking platforms. The earliest tools were simply split cobbles. It is not always clear which is the flake. Later tool-makers clearly identified and reworked flakes. Complaints that artifacts could not be distinguished from naturally fractured stone have helped spark careful studies of Oldowan techniques. These techniques have now been duplicated many times by archaeologists and other knappers, making misidentification of archaeological finds less likely.
Use of bone tools by hominins also producing Oldowan tools is known from Swartkrans, where a bone shaft with a polished point was discovered in Member (layer) I, dated 1.8–1.5 Ma. The Osteodontokeratic industry, the ""bone-tooth-horn"" industry hypothesized by Raymond Dart, is less certain.

Shapes and uses[edit]
Oldowan-tradition stone chopper.
Mary Leakey classified the Oldowan tools as Heavy Duty, Light Duty, Utilized Pieces and Debitage, or waste.[27] Heavy-duty tools are mainly cores. A chopper has an edge on one side. It is unifacial if the edge was created by flaking on one face of the core, or bifacial if on two. Discoid tools are roughly circular with a peripheral edge. Polyhedral tools are edged in the shape of a polyhedron. In addition there are spheroidal hammer stones. 
Light-duty tools are mainly flakes. There are scrapers, awls (with points for boring) and burins (with points for engraving). Some of these functions belong also to heavy-duty tools. For example, there are heavy-duty scrapers.
Utilized pieces are tools that began with one purpose in mind but were utilized opportunistically. Because of their use and variation, opportunities lead to the frequent modification of tools for either labor or forms of signaling has been proposed as a cause for the different shapes of similar tools.[28]
Oldowan tools were probably used for many purposes, which have been discovered from observation of modern apes and hunter-gatherers. Nuts and bones are cracked by hitting them with hammer stones on a stone used as an anvil. Battered and pitted stones testify to this possible use.
Heavy-duty tools could be used as axes for woodworking. Once a branch was separated, it could be scraped clean with a scraper, or hollowed with pointed tools. Such uses are attested by characteristic microscopic alterations of edges used to scrape wood. Oldowan tools could also have been used for preparing hides. Hides must be cut by slicing, piercing and scraping them clean of residues. Flakes are most suitable for this purpose.
Lawrence Keeley, following in the footsteps of Sergei Semenov, conducted microscopic studies (with a high-powered optical microscope) on the edges of tools manufactured de novo and used for the originally speculative purposes described above. He found that the marks were characteristic of the use and matched marks on prehistoric tools. Studies of the cut marks on bones using an electron microscope produce a similar result.

Abbevillian[edit]
Abbevillian is a currently obsolescent name for a tool tradition that is increasingly coming to be called Oldowan. The label Abbevillian prevailed until the Leakey family discovered older (yet similar) artifacts at Olduvai Gorge and promoted the African origin of man. Oldowan soon replaced Abbevillian in describing African and Asian lithics. The term Abbevillian is still used but is now restricted to Europe. The label, however, continues to lose popularity as a scientific designation.
In the late 20th century, discovery of the discrepancies in date caused a crisis of definition. Because Abbevillian did not necessarily precede Acheulean and both traditions had flakes and bifaces, it became difficult to differentiate the two. It was in this spirit that many artifacts formerly considered Abbevillian were labeled Acheulean. In consideration of the difficulty, some preferred to name both phases Acheulean. When the topic of Abbevillian came up, it was simply put down as a phase of Acheulean. Whatever was from Africa was Oldowan, and whatever from Europe, Acheulean.
The solution to the definition problem is to define the types in terms of complexity. Simply struck tools are Oldowan. Retouched, or reworked tools are Acheulean. Retouching is a second working of the artifact. The manufacturer first creates an Oldowan tool. Then he reworks or retouches the edges by removing very small chips so as to straighten and sharpen the edge. Typically but not necessarily the reworking is accomplished by pressure flaking.

Tool users[edit]

While the exact hominid is up for debate, it is believed that some of the first Oldowan makers did fall within the Homo line.[25] However, fossil evidence showed evolutionary features for human precision grip capabilities in Australopithecines.[29] This leads to current anthropological thinking in which Oldowan tools were made by late Australopithecus and early Homo. Homo habilis was named ""skillful"" because it was considered the earliest tool-using human ancestor.
Indeed, the genus Homo was in origin intended to separate tool-using species from their tool-less predecessors, hence the name of Australopithecus garhi, garhi meaning ""surprise"", a tool-using Australopithecine discovered in 1996 and described as the ""missing link"" between the genera Australopithecus and Homo. There is also evidence that some species of Paranthropus utilized stone tools.[30]
There is presently no evidence to show that Oldowan tools were the sole creation of members of the Homo line or that the ability to produce them was a special characteristic of only our ancestors. Research on tool use by modern wild chimpanzees in West Africa shows there is an operational sequence when chimpanzees use lithic implements to crack nuts. In the course of nut cracking, sometimes they will create unintentional flakes. Although the morphology of the chimpanzees' hammer is different from the Oldowan hammer, chimpanzees' ability to use stone tools indicates that the earliest lithic industries were probably not produced by only one kind of hominin species.[31]
Findings from fossil evidence and experimental replication of stone-tool users and manufacturers suggest the presence of physical characteristics of hand morphology for precise stone tool making.[25][29] The makers of Oldowan tools were mainly right-handed.[32] ""Handedness"" (lateralization) had thus already evolved, though it is not clear how related to modern lateralization it was, since other animals show handedness as well.[clarification needed]
In the mid-1970s, Glynn Isaac touched off a debate by proposing that human ancestors of this period had a ""place of origin"" and that they foraged outward from this home base, returning with high-quality food to share and to be processed. Over the course of the last 30 years, a variety of competing theories about how foraging occurred have been proposed, each one implying certain kinds of social strategy. The available evidence from the distribution of tools and remains is not enough to decide which theories are the most probable. However, three main groups of theories predominate.

Glynn Isaac's model became the Central Forage Point, as he responded to critics that accused him of attributing too much ""modern"" behavior to early hominins with relatively free-form searches outward.
A second group of models took modern chimpanzee behavior as a starting point, having the hominids use relatively fixed routes of foraging, and leaving tools where it was best to do so on a constant track.
A third group of theories had relatively loose bands scouring the range, taking care to move carcasses from dangerous death sites and leaving tools more or less at random.
Each group of models implies different grouping and social strategies, from the relative altruism of central base models to the relatively disjointed search models. (See also central foraging theory and Lewis Binford.)
Hominins probably lived in social groups that had contact with others. This conclusion is supported by the large number of bones at many sites, too large to be the work of one individual, and all of the scatter patterns implying many different individuals. Since modern primates in Africa have fluid boundaries between groups, as individuals enter, become the focus of bands, and others leave, it is also probable that the tools we find are the result of many overlapping groups working the same territories, and perhaps competing over them. Because of the huge expanse of time and the multiplicity of species associated with possible Oldowan tools, it is difficult to be more precise than this, since it is almost certain that different social groupings were used at different times and in different places.
There is also the question of what mix of hunting, gathering and scavenging the tool users employed. Early models focused on the tool users as hunters. The animals butchered by the tools include waterbuck, hartebeest, springbok, pig and zebra. However, the disposition of the bones allows some question about hominin methods of obtaining meat. That they were omnivores is unquestioned, as the digging implement and the probable use of hammer stones to smash nuts indicate. Lewis Binford first noticed that the bones at Olduvai contained a disproportionately high incidence of extremities, which are low in food substance. He concluded other predators had taken the best meat, and the hominins had only scavenged. The counter view is that while hunting many large animals would be beyond the reach of an individual human, groups could bring down larger game, as pack hunting animals are capable of doing. Moreover, since many animals both hunt and scavenge, it is possible that hominins hunted smaller animals, but were not above driving carnivores from larger kills, as they probably were driven from kills themselves from time to time.

Sites and archaeologists[edit]
A complete catalog of Oldowan sites would be too extensive for listing here. Some of the better-known sites include the following:

Africa[edit]
Ethiopia[edit]
Oldowan choppers dating to 1.7 million years BP, from Melka Kunture, Ethiopia
Afar Triangle[edit]
Sites in the Gona river system in the Hadar region of the Afar triangle, excavated by Helene Roche, J. W. Harris and Sileshi Semaw, yielded some of the oldest known Oldowan assemblages, dating to about 2.6 million years ago.  Raw material analysis done by Semaw showed that some assemblages in this region are biased towards a certain material (e.g.: 70% of the artifacts at sites EG10 and EG12 were composed of trachyte) indicating a selectivity in the quality of stone used.[33]  Recent excavations have yielded tools in association with cut-marked bones, indicating that Oldowan were used in meat-processing or -acquiring activities.

Omo River basin[edit]
The second oldest known Oldowan tool site comes from the Shungura formation of the Omo River basin. This formation documents the sediments of the Plio-Pleistocene and provides a record of the hominins that lived there. Lithic assemblages have been classified as Oldowan in members E and F in the lower Omo basin. Although there have been lithic assemblages found in multiple sites in these areas, only the Omo sites 57 and 123 in member F are accepted as hominin lithic remains. The assemblages at Omo sites 71 and 84 in member E do not show evidence of hominin modification and are therefore classified as natural assemblages.[34]
The tools are never found in direct association with the hominins, but archaeologists believe that they would be the strongest candidates for tool manufacture. There are no hominins in those layers, but the same layers elsewhere in the Omo valley contain Paranthropus and early Homo fossils. Paranthropus occurs in the preceding layers. In the last layer at 1.4 million years ago is only Homo erectus.

Egypt[edit]
Along the Nile River, within the 100-foot terrace, evidence of Chellean or Oldowan cultures has been found.[35]

Algeria[edit]
In November 2018 Science published a report of Oldowan artefacts in a secure dating context of 1.9 to 2.4 Ma from Ain Boucherit (Ain Hanech) in Setif.[36]

Kenya[edit]
Homa Peninsula[edit]
Kanjera South, part of the Kanjera site complex, and Nyayanga are located on the Homa Peninsula.[37] Kanjera South is estimated to around 2 Ma.[38] while Nyayanga is estimated to 2.9 Ma. One of the significant excavations, in the area, is Leakey's expedition in 1932-35.[37] In 1995, Oldowan and Plio-Pleistocene faunal remains surfaced from the site.[37] and in 2015 excavations led to the discovery of the earliest Oldowan stone tool technology in association with Paranthropus fossils and butchered hippo remains from Nyayanga.[10]

East Turkana[edit]
Main article: Koobi Fora
The numerous Koobi Fora sites on the east side of Lake Turkana are now part of Sibiloi National Park. Sites were initially excavated by Richard Leakey, Meave Leakey, Jack Harris, Glynn Isaac and others. Currently the artifacts found are classified as Oldowan or KBS Oldowan dated from 1.9–1.7 Ma, Karari (or ""advanced Oldowan"") dated to 1.6–1.4 Ma, and some early Acheulean at the end of the Karari. Over 200 hominins have been found, including Australopithecus and Homo.

West Turkana[edit]
In the Nachukui site in West Turkana, around 500 stone tools were found at a site named Naiyena Engol 2, or NY2. The assemblage at NY2 dates back to 1.8–1.7 Ma, around the peak of the Oldowan period.[39] At the site, freehand flaking was observed to be the most common type of technique for making these tools.[40] A common theme among sites in West Turkana is the high percentage of small flake tools gathered in the assemblages. However, NY2 seems to lack many of these tools, indicating a low productivity rate of flakes.[40]

Kilombe[edit]
Acheulian stone tools have been known about at Kilombe Main site in the central rift of Kenya since the 1970s with excavations by John Gowlett for his PhD. More recently, Oldowan technology has also been discovered in Kilombe Caldera in an unusual high altitude setting. The stone tools are associated with fossils and have been dated to 1.8 Ma, with Acheulian stone tools occurring in overlying levels.[41]

Tanzania[edit]
Olduvai Gorge[edit]
Chopper from Olduvai Gorge, some 1.8 million years old
The Oldowan industry is named after discoveries made in the Olduvai Gorge of Tanzania in east Africa by the Leakey family, primarily Mary Leakey, but also her husband Louis and their son, Richard.[42] Mary Leakey organized a typology of Early Pleistocene stone tools, which developed Oldowan tools into three chronological variants, A, B and C. Developed Oldowan B is of particular interest due to changes in morphology that appear to have been driven mostly by the short term availability of a chert resource from 1.65 to 1.53 Ma.[43] The flaking properties of this new resource resulted in considerably more core reduction and a higher prevalence of flake retouch. Similar tools had already been found in various locations in Europe and Asia for some time, where they were called Chellean and Abbevillian.
The oldest tool sites are in the East African Rift system, on the sediments of ancient streams and lakes. This is consistent with what we surmise of the evolution of man.[44]

South Africa[edit]
Abbé Breuil was the first recognized archaeologist to go on record to assert the existence of Oldowan tools.  While his description was for ""Chello-Abbevillean"" tools, and post-dated Leakey's finds at Olduvai Gorge by at least ten years, his descriptions nonetheless represented the scholarly acceptance of this technology as legitimate.  These findings were cited as being from the location of the Vaal River, at Vereeniging, and Breuil noted the distinct absence of a significant number of cores, suggesting a ""portable culture"".  At the time, this was considered very significant, as portability supported the conclusion that the Oldowan tool-makers were capable of planning for future needs, by creating the tools in a location which was distant from their use.[45]

Swartkrans[edit]
The Swartkrans site is a cave filled with layered fossil-bearing limestone deposits. Oldowan is found in Member 1 Lower Bank at 2.2-1.8 Ma in association with Paranthropus robustus and a single fossil attributed to Homo . The Member I assemblage also includes a shaft of pointed bone polished at the pointed end. Member I contained a high percentage of primate remains compared to other animal remains, which did not fit the hypothesis that H. habilis or P. robustus lived in the cave. C. K. Brain conducted a more detailed study and discovered the cave had been the abode of leopards, who preyed on the hominins.[46]

Sterkfontein[edit]
Another site of limestone caves is Sterkfontein, found in South Africa. This site contains a large number of not only Oldowan tools, but also early Acheulean technology.
[47]
Drimolen
The cave site of Drimolen has yielded 6 stone tools attributed to the Oldowan as well as 65 bone tools, along with specimens of Paranthropus robustus and Homo erectus [48][49]

Europe[edit]
Georgia[edit]
Stone tool (Oldowan style) from Dmanisi paleontological site (right, 1.8 mya, replica), to be compared with the more ""modern"" Acheulean style (left)
In 1999 and 2002, two Homo erectus skulls (H. georgicus) were discovered at Dmanisi in southern Georgia. The archaeological layer in which the human remains, hundreds of Oldowan stone tools, and numerous animal bones were unearthed is dated approximately 1.83-1.6 Ma. The site yields the earliest unequivocal evidence for presence of early humans outside the African continent.[50]

Bulgaria[edit]
At Kozarnika, in the ground layers, dated to 1.6-1.4 Ma, archaeologists have discovered a human molar tooth, lower palaeolithic assemblages that belong to a core-and-flake non-Acheulian industry and incised bones that may be the earliest example of human symbolic behaviour.[citation needed]

Russia[edit]
Ainikab-1 [ru] and Muhkay-2[51] (North Caucasus, Daghestan) are the extraordinary sites in relation to date and the culture. Geological and geomorphological data, palynological studies and paleomagnetic testing unequivocally point to Early Pleistocene (Eopleistocene), indicating the age of the sites as being within the range of 1.8 – 1.2 Ma.[52][51]

Spain[edit]
Extremely archaic handaxe from the Quaternary fluvial terraces of Duero river (Valladolid, Spain) dated to Oldowan/Abbevillian period (Lower Paleolithic).
Oldowan tools have been found at the following sites: Fuente Nueva 3, Barranco del Leon, Sima del Elefante, Atapuerca TD 6.

France[edit]
Oldowan tools have been found at: Lézignan-la-Cèbe, 1.5 Ma; Abbeville, 1–0.5 Ma; Vallonnet cave, French Riviera; Soleihac, open-air site in Massif Central.  Oldowan tools have also been found at Tautavel in the foothills of the Pyrenees. These were discovered by Henry de Lumbley alongside human remains (cranium). The tools are of limestone and quartz.

Elsewhere[edit]
Oldowan tools have been found in Italy at the Monte Poggiolo open air site dated to approximately 850 ka, making them the oldest evidence of human habitation in Italy.  In Germany tools have been found in river gravels at Kärlich dating from 300 ka.  In the Czech Republic tools have been found in ancient lake deposits at Przeletice and a cave site at Stranska Skala, dated no later than 500 ka.  In Hungary tools have been found at a spring site at Vértesszőlős dating from 500 ka.

Asia[edit]

China[edit]
At the Xihoudu site in China, 32 stone tools were found, including choppers, scrapers, and 3-edged tools. These tools were dated back to 1.8 Ma. This site also included cultural artifacts, such as animal fossils, burnt bones, and cut antlers.[53] The presence of numerous fish and beaver fossils near the stone tools indicate the existence of a body of water at the site.

Pakistan[edit]
In Pakistan, Oldowan tools have been found at Riwat during a 1980s excavation. Many of the stones found at this site were considered waste products of stone tool production, as they were small flakes chipped off of larger stones. In total, 1,479 tools and flakes were discovered at this site.[54]

Syria[edit]
An excavated site at El Kowm (Aïn al Fil, (de:Aïn al Fil)), Syria revealed a plethora of Oldowan tools. In a 2m2 test pit excavated in 2008, 790 artifacts were found, with many pebble tools, cores, flakes, manuports, and flake debris. Although many of these tools show little sign of modification, several of the pebble tools are distinctly-shaped bifacial and trifacial choppers. Dated between 2.0-1.8 Ma, these stone tools are some of the earliest Near East finds.[55]
Because of their location in the Syrian desert, these tools have raised questions about the path of early hominin dispersal. The predominant theory that early hominins traveled along the Mediterranean, through what is now Israel, into Europe has been challenged, as the presence of these Oldowan tools indicate that an alternate route may have been taken.[44]

Iran[edit]
In Iran, 80 tools of different assemblages have been discovered at 7 sites in the Kashafrud Basin.[44] Although many of the artifacts found here, dated at 1.8 Ma, were pre-Acheulean, some are of the Oldowan tradition, resembling East African Oldowan finds.  Containing cores, choppers, flake, chunks, and hammer stones made predominately of quartz, this site displayed the ability of early toolmakers to work skillfully with fragile stones.

Israel[edit]
The site at Bizat Ruhama (near kibbutz Ruhama) has shown evidence that the complexity of the stone tool-making process was more complex than researchers previously thought,[56] leading to a new perspective on the capabilities of invention and adaptability of Oldowan hominin populations.
Another key find at the Bizat Ruhama site was that of the secondary flakes. The discovery of these secondary flakes have led researchers to believe that this was an intentional response to a raw material constraint.
According to the micro-morphological studies at the Bizat Ruhama site, the archaeological assemblages represent one or several occupations of the site in a relatively short time frame.

^ Many scientists had drawn the erroneous conclusion that Homo habilis was the predator responsible for these remains, using Oldowan tools. The higher percentage of primate bones was interpreted as a kind of cannibalism, feeding the imagination of Raymond Dart. Brain examined the bones and concluded that the marks resulting from stripping and chewing the bones were made by a leopard.

What is the Banach-Tarski Paradox?,"The Banach-Tarski Paradox is a famous mathematical theorem named after Stefan Banach and Albert Tarski, which states that it is impossible to dissect a sphere into a finite number of pieces, and then reassemble those pieces to form two identical spheres.

The paradox can be illustrated with the following example:

Imagine you have a tennis ball and you want to dissect it into a finite number of pieces. You can cut the ball into four equal pieces, but these pieces are not identical to the original ball. The pieces are not the same size and shape as the original ball, and they can be separated into two pieces that are not identical to each other.

Now imagine you have two identical tennis balls. You can dissect each of them into four pieces, and then reassemble those pieces to form two identical tennis balls. But the pieces are not identical to the original balls, and they can be separated into two pieces that are not identical to each other.

The paradox is that it is impossible to dissect a sphere into a finite number of pieces, and then reassemble those pieces to form two identical spheres. This is a paradoxical statement because it seems to imply that it is possible to do something impossible.

The Banach-Tarski Paradox is a fundamental result in the field of topology, which is the study of spaces that are not necessarily Euclidean, and it has important applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox,"

Geometric theorem
For the book about the paradox, see The Banach–Tarski Paradox (book).
""Can a ball be decomposed into a finite number of point sets and reassembled into two balls identical to the original?""
The Banach–Tarski paradox is a theorem in set-theoretic geometry, which states the following: Given a solid ball in three-dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball. Indeed, the reassembly process involves only moving the pieces around and rotating them, without changing their original shape. However, the pieces themselves are not ""solids"" in the traditional sense, but infinite scatterings of points.  The reconstruction can work with as few as five pieces.[1]
An alternative form of the theorem states that given any two ""reasonable"" solid objects (such as a small ball and a huge ball), the cut pieces of either one can be reassembled into the other. This is often stated informally as ""a pea can be chopped up and reassembled into the Sun"" and called the ""pea and the Sun paradox"".
The theorem is a veridical paradox: it contradicts basic geometric intuition, but is not false or self-contradictory. ""Doubling the ball"" by dividing it into parts and moving them around by rotations and translations, without any stretching, bending, or adding new points, seems to be impossible, since all these operations ought, intuitively speaking, to preserve the volume. The intuition that such operations preserve volumes is not mathematically absurd and it is even included in the formal definition of volumes. However, this is not applicable here because in this case it is impossible to define the volumes of the considered subsets. Reassembling them reproduces a set that has a volume, which happens to be different from the volume at the start.
Unlike most theorems in geometry, the mathematical proof of this result depends on the choice of axioms for set theory in a critical way. It can be proven using the axiom of choice, which allows for the construction of non-measurable sets, i.e., collections of points that do not have a volume in the ordinary sense, and whose construction requires an uncountable number of choices.[2]
It was shown in 2005 that the pieces in the decomposition can be chosen in such a way that they can be moved continuously into place without running into one another.[3]
As proved independently by Leroy[4] and Simpson,[5] the Banach–Tarski paradox does not violate volumes if one works with locales rather than topological spaces. In this abstract setting, it is possible to have subspaces without point but still nonempty. The parts of the paradoxical decomposition do intersect a lot in the sense of locales, so much that some of these intersections should be given a positive mass. Allowing for this hidden mass to be taken into account, the theory of locales permits all subsets (and even all sublocales) of the Euclidean space to be satisfactorily measured.


Banach and Tarski publication[edit]
In a paper published in 1924,[6] Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski gave a construction of such a paradoxical decomposition, based on earlier work by Giuseppe Vitali concerning the unit interval and on the paradoxical decompositions of the sphere by Felix Hausdorff, and discussed a number of related questions concerning decompositions of subsets of Euclidean spaces in various dimensions. They proved the following more general statement, the strong form of the Banach–Tarski paradox:

Given any two bounded subsets A and B of a Euclidean space in at least three dimensions, both of which have a nonempty interior, there are partitions of A and B into a finite number of disjoint subsets, 



A
=

A

1


∪
⋯
∪

A

k




{\displaystyle A=A_{1}\cup \cdots \cup A_{k}}

, 



B
=

B

1


∪
⋯
∪

B

k




{\displaystyle B=B_{1}\cup \cdots \cup B_{k}}

 (for some integer k), such that for each (integer) i between 1 and k, the sets Ai and Bi are congruent.
Now let A be the original ball and B be the union of two translated copies of the original ball. Then the proposition means that the original ball A can be divided into a certain number of pieces and then be rotated and translated in such a way that the result is the whole set B, which contains two copies of A.
The strong form of the Banach–Tarski paradox is false in dimensions one and two, but Banach and Tarski showed that an analogous statement remains true if countably many subsets are allowed. The difference between dimensions 1 and 2 on the one hand, and 3 and higher on the other hand, is due to the richer structure of the group E(n) of Euclidean motions in 3 dimensions. For n = 1, 2 the group is solvable, but for n ≥ 3  it contains a free group with two generators. John von Neumann studied the properties of the group of equivalences that make a paradoxical decomposition possible, and introduced the notion of amenable groups. He also found a form of the paradox in the plane which uses area-preserving affine transformations in place of the usual congruences.
Tarski proved that amenable groups are precisely those for which no paradoxical decompositions exist. Since only free subgroups are needed in the Banach–Tarski paradox, this led to the long-standing von Neumann conjecture, which was disproved in 1980.

Formal treatment[edit]
The Banach–Tarski paradox states that a ball in the ordinary Euclidean space can be doubled using only the operations of partitioning into subsets, replacing a set with a congruent set, and reassembling. Its mathematical structure is greatly elucidated by emphasizing the role played by the group of Euclidean motions and introducing the notions of equidecomposable sets and a paradoxical set. Suppose that G is a group acting on a set X. In the most important special case, X is an n-dimensional Euclidean space (for integral n), and G consists of all isometries of X, i.e. the transformations of X into itself that preserve the distances, usually denoted E(n). Two geometric figures that can be transformed into each other are called congruent, and this terminology will be extended to the general G-action. Two subsets A and B of X are called G-equidecomposable, or equidecomposable with respect to G, if A and B can be partitioned into the same finite number of respectively G-congruent pieces. This defines an equivalence relation among all subsets of X. Formally, if there exist non-empty sets

and there exist elements

{\displaystyle g_{i}(A_{i})=B_{i}{\text{ for all }}1\leq i\leq k,}


then it can be said that A and B are G-equidecomposable using k pieces. If a set E has two disjoint subsets A and B such that A and E, as well as B and E, are  G-equidecomposable, then E is called paradoxical.
Using this terminology, the Banach–Tarski paradox can be reformulated as follows:

A three-dimensional Euclidean ball is equidecomposable with two copies of itself.
In fact, there is a sharp result in this case, due to Raphael M. Robinson:[7] doubling the ball can be accomplished with five pieces, and fewer than five pieces will not suffice.
The strong version of the paradox claims:

Any two bounded subsets of 3-dimensional Euclidean space with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable.
While apparently more general, this statement is derived in a simple way from the doubling of a ball by using a generalization of the Bernstein–Schroeder theorem due to Banach that implies that if A is equidecomposable with a subset of B and B is equidecomposable with a subset of A, then A and B are equidecomposable.
The Banach–Tarski paradox can be put in context by pointing out that for two sets in the strong form of the paradox, there is always a bijective function that can map the points in one shape into the other in a one-to-one fashion. In the language of Georg Cantor's set theory, these two sets have equal cardinality. Thus, if one enlarges the group to allow arbitrary bijections of X, then all sets with non-empty interior become congruent. Likewise, one ball can be made into a larger or smaller ball by stretching, or in other words, by applying similarity transformations. Hence, if the group G is large enough, G-equidecomposable sets may be found whose ""size""s vary. Moreover, since a countable set can be made into two copies of itself, one might expect that using countably many pieces could somehow do the trick.
On the other hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox, the number of pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which preserve the volumes. Yet, somehow, they end up doubling the volume of the ball. While this is certainly surprising, some of the pieces used in the paradoxical decomposition are non-measurable sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates that it is impossible to find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) dimensions that is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.
The heart of the proof of the ""doubling the ball"" form of the paradox presented below is the remarkable fact that by a Euclidean isometry (and renaming of elements), one can divide a certain set (essentially, the surface of a unit sphere) into four parts, then rotate one of them to become itself plus two of the other parts. This follows rather easily from a F2-paradoxical decomposition of F2, the free group with two generators. Banach and Tarski's proof relied on an analogous fact discovered by Hausdorff some years earlier: the surface of a unit sphere in space is a disjoint union of three sets B, C, D and a countable set E such that, on the one hand, B, C, D are pairwise congruent, and on the other hand, B is congruent with the union of C and D. This is often called the Hausdorff paradox.

Connection with earlier work and the role of the axiom of choice[edit]
Banach and Tarski explicitly acknowledge Giuseppe Vitali's 1905 construction of the set bearing his name, Hausdorff's paradox (1914), and an earlier (1923) paper of Banach as the precursors to their work. Vitali's and Hausdorff's constructions depend on Zermelo's axiom of choice (""AC""), which is also crucial to the Banach–Tarski paper, both for proving their paradox and for the proof of another result:

Two Euclidean polygons, one of which strictly contains the other, are not equidecomposable.
They remark:

Le rôle que joue cet axiome dans nos raisonnements nous semble mériter l'attention
(The role this axiom plays in our reasoning seems to us to deserve attention)
They point out that while the second result fully agrees with geometric intuition, its proof uses AC in an even more substantial way than the proof of the paradox. Thus Banach and Tarski imply that AC should not be rejected solely because it produces a paradoxical decomposition, for such an argument also undermines proofs of geometrically intuitive statements.
However, in 1949, A. P. Morse showed that the statement about Euclidean polygons can be proved in ZF set theory and thus does not require the axiom of choice. In 1964, Paul Cohen proved that the axiom of choice is independent from ZF – that is, choice cannot be proved from ZF. A weaker version of an axiom of choice is the axiom of dependent choice, DC, and it has been shown that DC is not sufficient for proving the Banach–Tarski paradox, that is,

The Banach–Tarski paradox is not a theorem of ZF, nor of ZF+DC, assuming their consistency.[8]
Large amounts of mathematics use AC. As Stan Wagon points out at the end of his monograph, the Banach–Tarski paradox has been more significant for its role in pure mathematics than for foundational questions:  it motivated a fruitful new direction for research, the amenability of groups, which has nothing to do with the foundational questions.

In 1991, using then-recent results by Matthew Foreman and Friedrich Wehrung,[9] Janusz Pawlikowski proved that the Banach–Tarski paradox follows from ZF plus the Hahn–Banach theorem.[10] The Hahn–Banach theorem does not rely on the full axiom of choice but can be proved using a weaker version of AC called the ultrafilter lemma.

A sketch of the proof[edit]
Here a proof is sketched which is similar but not identical to that given by Banach and Tarski. Essentially, the paradoxical decomposition of the ball is achieved in four steps:

Find a paradoxical decomposition of the free group in two generators.
Find a group of rotations in 3-d space isomorphic to the free group in two generators.
Use the paradoxical decomposition of that group and the axiom of choice to produce a paradoxical decomposition of the hollow unit sphere.
Extend this decomposition of the sphere to a decomposition of the solid unit ball.
These steps are discussed in more detail below.

Step 1[edit]
Cayley graph of F2, showing decomposition into the sets S(a) and aS(a−1).  Traversing a horizontal edge of the graph in the rightward direction represents left multiplication of an element of F2 by a; traversing a vertical edge of the graph in the upward direction represents left multiplication of an element of F2 by b.  Elements of the set S(a) are green dots; elements of the set aS(a−1) are blue dots or red dots with blue border.   Red dots with blue border are elements of S(a−1), which is a subset of aS(a−1).
The free group with two generators a and b consists of all finite strings that can be formed from the four symbols a, a−1, b and b−1 such that no a appears directly next to an a−1 and no b appears directly next to a b−1. Two such strings can be concatenated and converted into a string of this type by repeatedly replacing the ""forbidden"" substrings with the empty string. For instance: abab−1a−1 concatenated with abab−1a yields abab−1a−1abab−1a, which contains the substring a−1a, and so gets reduced to abab−1bab−1a, which contains the substring b−1b, which gets reduced to abaab−1a. One can check that the set of those strings with this operation forms a group with identity element the empty string e. This group may be called F2.
The group 




F

{\displaystyle F_{2}}

 can be ""paradoxically decomposed"" as follows: Let S(a) be the subset of 




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}

 consisting of all strings that start with a, and define S(a−1), S(b) and S(b−1) similarly. Clearly,

)
,


{\displaystyle F_{2}=bS(b^{-1})\cup S(b),}


where the notation aS(a−1) means take all the strings in S(a−1) and concatenate them on the left with a.
This is at the core of the proof. For example, there may be a string 



a

a

−
1


b


{\displaystyle aa^{-1}b}

 in the set 



a
S
(

a

−

)


{\displaystyle aS(a^{-1})}

 which, because of the rule that 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 must not appear next to 




a

−
1




{\displaystyle a^{-1}}

, reduces to the string 



b


{\displaystyle b}

.  Similarly, 



a
S
(

a

−

)


{\displaystyle aS(a^{-1})}

 contains all the strings that start with 




a

−
1




{\displaystyle a^{-1}}

 (for example, the string 



a

a

−
1



a

−
1




{\displaystyle aa^{-1}a^{-1}}

 which reduces to 




a

−
1




{\displaystyle a^{-1}}

). In this way,

S
(

{\displaystyle aS(a^{-1})}

 contains all the strings that start with 



b


{\displaystyle b}

, 




b

−
1




{\displaystyle b^{-1}}

 and 




a

−
1




{\displaystyle a^{-1}}

, as well as the empty string 



e


{\displaystyle e}

.
Group F2 has been cut into four pieces (plus the singleton {e}), then two of them ""shifted"" by multiplying with a or b, then ""reassembled"" as two pieces to make one copy of 




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}

 and the other two to make another copy of 




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}

. That is exactly what is intended to do to the ball.

Step 2[edit]
In order to find a free group of rotations of 3D space, i.e. that behaves just like (or ""is isomorphic to"") the free group F2, two orthogonal axes are taken (e.g. the x and z axes). Then, A is taken to be a rotation of 



θ
=
arccos
⁡

(

)



{\textstyle \theta =\arccos \left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)}

 about the x axis, and B to be a rotation of 



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }

 about the z axis (there are many other suitable pairs of irrational multiples of π that could be used here as well).[11]
The group of rotations generated by A and B will be called H. 
Let 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 be an element of H that starts with a positive rotation about the z axis, that is, an element of the form 



ω
=
…

b

{\displaystyle k_{1}>0,\ k_{2},k_{3},\ldots ,k_{n}\neq 0,\ n\geq 1}

. It can be shown by induction that 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 maps the point 



(

)


{\displaystyle (1,0,0)}

 to 




(

{\textstyle \left({\frac {k}{3^{N}}},{\frac {l{\sqrt {2}}}{3^{N}}},{\frac {m}{3^{N}}}\right)}

, for some

,
l
,
m

,
N

{\displaystyle k,l,m\in \mathbb {Z} ,N\in \mathbb {N} }

. Analyzing 



k
,
l


{\displaystyle k,l}

 and 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 modulo 3, one can show that 



l
≠
0


{\displaystyle l\neq 0}

. The same argument repeated (by symmetry of the problem) is valid when 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 starts with a negative rotation about the z axis, or a rotation about the x axis. This shows that if 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 is given by a non-trivial word in A and B, then 



ω
≠
e


{\displaystyle \omega \neq e}

. Therefore, the group H is a free group, isomorphic to F2.
The two rotations behave just like the elements a and b in the group F2: there is now a paradoxical decomposition of H.
This step cannot be performed in two dimensions since it involves rotations in three dimensions. If two nontrivial rotations are taken about the same axis, the resulting group is either 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 (if the ratio between the two angles is rational) or the free abelian group over two elements; either way, it does not have the property required in step 1.
An alternative arithmetic proof of the existence of free groups in some special orthogonal groups using integral quaternions leads to paradoxical decompositions of the rotation group.[12]

Step 3[edit]
The unit sphere S2 is partitioned into orbits by the action of our group H: two points belong to the same orbit if and only if there is a rotation in H which moves the first point into the second. (Note that the orbit of a point is a dense set in S2.) The axiom of choice can be used to pick exactly one point from every orbit; collect these points into a set M. The action of H on a given orbit is free and transitive and so 
each orbit can be identified with H. In other words, every point in S2 can be reached in exactly one way by applying the proper rotation from H to the proper element from M. Because of this, the paradoxical decomposition of H yields a paradoxical decomposition of S2 into four pieces A1, A2, A3, A4 as follows:






A

S
(
a
)
M

{\displaystyle A_{1}=S(a)M\cup M\cup B}

{\displaystyle A_{2}=S(a^{-1})M\setminus B}

(

)
M



{\displaystyle \displaystyle A_{3}=S(b)M}








A

4


=
S
(

b

−

)
M



{\displaystyle \displaystyle A_{4}=S(b^{-1})M}


where we define





S
(

M
=
{

|

s
∈
S
(
a
)
,
x
∈

}


{\displaystyle S(a)M=\{s(x)|s\in S(a),x\in M\}}


and likewise for the other sets, and where we define





B
=

a

−
1


M
∪

a

−
2


M
∪
…


{\displaystyle B=a^{-1}M\cup a^{-2}M\cup \dots }


(The five ""paradoxical"" parts of F2 were not used directly, as they would leave M as an extra piece after doubling, owing to the presence of the singleton {e}.)
The (majority of the) sphere has now been divided into four sets (each one dense on the sphere), and when two of these are rotated, the result is double of what was had before:

Step 4[edit]
Finally, connect every point on S2 with a half-open segment to the origin; the paradoxical decomposition of S2 then yields a paradoxical decomposition of the solid unit ball minus the point at the ball's center. (This center point needs a bit more care; see below.)
N.B. This sketch glosses over some details. One has to be careful about the set of points on the sphere which happen to lie on the axis of some rotation in H. However, there are only countably many such points, and like the case of the point at the center of the ball, it is possible to patch the proof to account for them all. (See below.)

Some details, fleshed out[edit]
In Step 3, the sphere was partitioned into orbits of our group H. To streamline the proof, the discussion of points that are fixed by some rotation was omitted; since the paradoxical decomposition of F2 relies on shifting certain subsets, the fact that some points are fixed might cause some trouble. Since any rotation of S2 (other than the null rotation) has exactly two fixed points, and since H, which is isomorphic to F2, is countable, there are countably many points of S2 that are fixed by some rotation in H. Denote this set of fixed points as D. Step 3 proves that S2 − D admits a paradoxical decomposition.
What remains to be shown is the Claim: S2 − D is equidecomposable with S2.
Proof. Let λ be some line through the origin that does not intersect any point in D. This is possible since D is countable. Let J be the set of angles, α, such that for some natural number n, and some P in D, r(nα)P is also in D, where r(nα) is a rotation about λ of nα. Then J is countable. So there exists an angle θ not in J. Let ρ be the rotation about λ by θ. Then ρ acts on S2 with no fixed points in D, i.e., ρn(D) is disjoint from D, and for natural m<n, ρn(D) is disjoint from ρm(D). Let E be the disjoint union of ρn(D) over n = 0, 1, 2, ... . Then S2 = E ∪ (S2 − E) ~ ρ(E) ∪ (S2 − E) = (E − D) ∪ (S2 − E) = S2 − D, where ~ denotes ""is equidecomposable to"".
For step 4, it has already been shown that the ball minus a point admits a paradoxical decomposition; it remains to be shown that the ball minus a point is equidecomposable with the ball. Consider a circle within the ball, containing the point at the center of the ball. Using an argument like that used to prove the Claim, one can see that the full circle is equidecomposable with the circle minus the point at the ball's center. (Basically, a countable set of points on the circle can be rotated to give itself plus one more point.) Note that this involves the rotation about a point other than the origin, so the Banach–Tarski paradox involves isometries of Euclidean 3-space rather than just SO(3).
Use is made of the fact that if A ~ B and B ~ C, then A ~ C. The decomposition of A into C can be done using number of pieces equal to the product of the numbers needed for taking A into B and for taking B into C.
The proof sketched above requires 2 × 4 × 2 + 8 = 24 pieces - a factor of 2 to remove fixed points, a factor 4 from step 1, a factor 2 to recreate fixed points, and 8 for the center point of the second ball. But in step 1 when moving {e} and all strings of the form an into S(a−1), do this to all orbits except one. Move {e} of this last orbit to the center point of the second ball. This brings the total down to 16 + 1 pieces. With more algebra, one can also decompose fixed orbits into 4 sets as in step 1. This gives 5 pieces and is the best possible.

Obtaining infinitely many balls from one[edit]
Using the Banach–Tarski paradox, it is possible to obtain k copies of a ball in the Euclidean n-space from one, for any integers n ≥ 3 and k ≥ 1, i.e. a ball can be cut into k pieces so that each of them is equidecomposable to a ball of the same size as the original. Using the fact that the free group F2 of rank 2 admits a free subgroup of countably infinite rank, a similar proof yields that the unit sphere Sn−1 can be partitioned into countably infinitely many pieces, each of which is equidecomposable (with two pieces) to the Sn−1 using rotations. By using analytic properties of the rotation group SO(n), which is a connected analytic Lie group, one can further prove that the sphere Sn−1 can be partitioned into as many pieces as there are real numbers (that is,

{\displaystyle 2^{\aleph _{0}}}

 pieces), so that each piece is equidecomposable with two pieces to Sn−1 using rotations. These results then extend to the unit ball deprived of the origin. A 2010 article by Valeriy Churkin gives a new proof of the continuous version of the Banach–Tarski paradox.[13]

Von Neumann paradox in the Euclidean plane[edit]
Main article: Von Neumann paradox
In the Euclidean plane, two figures that are equidecomposable with respect to the group of Euclidean motions are necessarily of the same area, and therefore, a paradoxical decomposition of a square or disk of Banach–Tarski type that uses only Euclidean congruences is impossible. A conceptual explanation of the distinction between the planar and higher-dimensional cases was given by John von Neumann: unlike the group SO(3) of rotations in three dimensions, the group E(2) of Euclidean motions of the plane is solvable, which implies the existence of a finitely-additive measure on E(2) and R2 which is invariant under translations and rotations, and rules out paradoxical decompositions of non-negligible sets. Von Neumann then posed the following question: can such a paradoxical decomposition be constructed if one allows a larger group of equivalences?
It is clear that if one permits similarities, any two squares in the plane become equivalent even without further subdivision. This motivates restricting one's attention to the group SA2 of area-preserving affine transformations. Since the area is preserved, any paradoxical decomposition of a square with respect to this group would be counterintuitive for the same reasons as the Banach–Tarski decomposition of a ball. In fact, the group SA2 contains as a subgroup the special linear group SL(2,R), which in its turn contains the free group F2 with two generators as a subgroup. This makes it plausible that the proof of Banach–Tarski paradox can be imitated in the plane. The main difficulty here lies in the fact that the unit square is not invariant under the action of the linear group SL(2, R), hence one cannot simply transfer a paradoxical decomposition from the group to the square, as in the third step of the above proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox. Moreover, the fixed points of the group present difficulties (for example, the origin is fixed under all linear transformations). This is why von Neumann used the larger group SA2 including the translations, and he constructed a paradoxical decomposition of the unit square with respect to the enlarged group (in 1929). Applying the Banach–Tarski method, the paradox for the square can be strengthened as follows:

Any two bounded subsets of the Euclidean plane with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable with respect to the area-preserving affine maps.
As von Neumann notes:[14]

""Infolgedessen gibt es bereits in der Ebene kein nichtnegatives additives Maß (wo das Einheitsquadrat das Maß 1 hat), das gegenüber allen Abbildungen von A2 invariant wäre.""
""In accordance with this, already in the plane there is no non-negative additive measure (for which the unit square has a measure of 1), which is invariant with respect to all transformations belonging to A2 [the group of area-preserving affine transformations].""
To explain further, the question of whether a finitely additive measure (that is preserved under certain transformations) exists or not depends on what transformations are allowed. The Banach measure of sets in the plane, which is preserved by translations and rotations, is not preserved by non-isometric transformations even when they do preserve the area of polygons. The points of the plane (other than the origin) can be divided into two dense sets which may be called A and B. If the A points of a given polygon are transformed by a certain area-preserving transformation and the B points by another, both sets can become subsets of the A points in two new polygons. The new polygons have the same area as the old polygon, but the two transformed sets cannot have the same measure as before (since they contain only part of the A points), and therefore there is no measure that ""works"".
The class of groups isolated by von Neumann in the course of study of Banach–Tarski phenomenon turned out to be very important for many areas of Mathematics: these are amenable groups, or groups with an invariant mean, and include all finite and all solvable groups. Generally speaking, paradoxical decompositions arise when the group used for equivalences in the definition of equidecomposability is not amenable.

Recent progress[edit]
2000: Von Neumann's paper left open the possibility of a paradoxical decomposition of the interior of the unit square with respect to the linear group SL(2,R) (Wagon, Question 7.4). In 2000, Miklós Laczkovich proved that such a decomposition exists.[15] More precisely, let A be the family of all bounded subsets of the plane with non-empty interior and at a positive distance from the origin, and B the family of all planar sets with the property that a union of finitely many translates under some elements of SL(2, R) contains a punctured neighborhood of the origin. Then all sets in the family A are SL(2, R)-equidecomposable, and likewise for the sets in B. It follows that both families consist of paradoxical sets.
2003: It had been known for a long time that the full plane was paradoxical with respect to SA2, and that the minimal number of pieces would equal four provided that there exists a locally commutative free subgroup of SA2. In 2003 Kenzi Satô constructed such a subgroup, confirming that four pieces suffice.[16]
2011: Laczkovich's paper[17] left open the possibility that  there exists a free group F of piecewise linear transformations acting on the punctured disk D \ {(0,0)} without fixed points. Grzegorz Tomkowicz constructed such a group,[18] showing that the system of congruences A ≈ B ≈ C ≈ B U C can be realized by means of F and D \ {(0,0)}.
2017: It has been known for a long time that there exists in the hyperbolic plane H2 a set E that is a third, a fourth and ... and a

-th part of H2. The requirement was satisfied by orientation-preserving isometries of H2. Analogous results were obtained by John Frank Adams[19] and Jan Mycielski[20] who showed that the unit sphere S2 contains a set E that is a half, a third, a fourth and ... and a

{\displaystyle 2^{\aleph _{0}}}

-th part of S2. Grzegorz Tomkowicz[21] showed that Adams and Mycielski construction can be generalized to obtain a set E of H2 with the same properties as in S2.
2017: Von Neumann's paradox concerns the Euclidean plane, but there are also other classical spaces where the paradoxes are possible. For example, one can ask if there is a Banach–Tarski paradox in the hyperbolic plane H2. This was shown by Jan Mycielski and Grzegorz Tomkowicz.[22][23] Tomkowicz[24] proved also that most of the classical paradoxes are an easy consequence of a graph theoretical result and the fact that the groups in question are rich enough.
2018: In 1984, Jan Mycielski and Stan Wagon [25] constructed a paradoxical decomposition of the hyperbolic plane H2 that uses Borel sets. The paradox depends on the existence of a properly discontinuous subgroup of the group of isometries of H2. A similar paradox was obtained in 2018 by Grzegorz Tomkowicz,[26] who constructed a free properly discontinuous subgroup G of the affine group SA(3,Z). The existence of such a group implies the existence of a subset E of Z3 such that for any finite F of Z3 there exists an element g of G such that

{\displaystyle g(E)=E\triangle F}

, where

{\displaystyle E\,\triangle \,F}

 denotes the symmetric difference of E and F.
2019: Banach–Tarski paradox uses finitely many pieces in the duplication. In the case of countably many pieces, any two sets with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable using translations. But allowing only Lebesgue measurable pieces one obtains: If A and B are subsets of Rn with non-empty interiors, then they have equal Lebesgue measures if and only if they are countably equidecomposable using Lebesgue measurable pieces. Jan Mycielski and Grzegorz Tomkowicz [27] extended this result to finite dimensional Lie groups and second countable locally compact topological groups that are totally disconnected or have countably many connected components.
2024: Robert Samuel Simon and Grzegorz Tomkowicz [28] introduced a colouring rule of points in a Cantor space that links paradoxical decompositions with optimisation. This allows one to find an application of paradoxical decompositions in economics.
2024: Grzegorz Tomkowicz [29] proved that in the case of non-supramenable connected Lie groups G acting continuously and transitively on a metric space, bounded G paradoxical sets are generic.

"
What is the architectural style of the Chrysler Building?,"The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco skyscraper located at 405 Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was designed by architect William Van Alen and built between 1928 and 1930. The building's architectural style is considered to be a fusion of the Beaux-Arts and International Style, as it combines the classical proportions and geometry of the Beaux-Arts style with the sleek, streamlined forms of the International Style.

The Chrysler Building's exterior features a series of curved surfaces, geometric shapes, and bold, angular lines that create a dynamic and visually impressive design. The building's most famous feature is the 48-foot-wide (14.6 m) curved glass entrance marquee, which is illuminated at night and is visible from a distance. The marquee's design is also notable for its use of a series of intersecting arches and curved panels that create a rhythmic pattern.

The Chrysler Building's interior is also noteworthy for its Art Deco design elements. The lobby features a series of curved walls, geometric shapes, and bold, angular lines that create a dynamic and visually impressive space. The building's elevators are also notable for their Art Deco design, with curved walls, geometric shapes, and bold, angular lines that create a dynamic and visually impressive space.

The Chrysler Building was completed in 1930 and was originally intended to be the tallest building in the world. However, the Empire State Building surpassed it in height in 1931. Despite this, the Chrysler Building remained one of the most iconic and recognizable skyscrapers in the world and has been featured in numerous films and television shows.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Building,"

The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco skyscraper on the East Side of Manhattan in New York City, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. At 1,046 ft (319 m), it is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework. It was both the world's first supertall skyscraper and the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. As of 2019[update], the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building.[12]
Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was commissioned by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation. The construction of the Chrysler Building, an early skyscraper, was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The Chrysler Building was designed and funded by Walter Chrysler personally as a real estate investment for his children, but it was not intended as the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters. An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners.
When the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, some calling it inane and unoriginal, others hailing it as modernist and iconic. Reviewers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries regarded the building as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style. In 2007, it was ranked ninth on the American Institute of Architects' list of America's Favorite Architecture. The facade and interior became New York City designated landmarks in 1978, and the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976.


Site[edit]
The Chrysler Building is on the eastern side of Lexington Avenue between 42nd and 43rd streets in Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[13] The land was donated to The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1902.[14][15] The site is roughly a trapezoid with a 201-foot-long (61 m) frontage on Lexington Avenue; a 167-foot-long (51 m) frontage on 42nd Street; and a 205-foot-long (62 m) frontage on 43rd Street.[16] The site bordered the old Boston Post Road,[17][18] which predated, and ran aslant of, the Manhattan street grid established by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. As a result, the east side of the building's base is similarly aslant.[19] The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10174. It is one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that have their own ZIP Codes, as of 2019[update].[20]
The Grand Hyatt New York hotel and the Graybar Building are across Lexington Avenue, while the Socony–Mobil Building is across 42nd Street. In addition, the Chanin Building is to the southwest, diagonally across Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street.[13]

Architecture[edit]
The Chrysler Building was designed by William Van Alen in the Art Deco style and is named after one of its original tenants, automotive executive Walter Chrysler.[21][22] With a height of 1,046 feet (319 m), the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city as of 2019[update], tied with The New York Times Building.[23] The building is constructed of a steel frame infilled with masonry, with areas of decorative metal cladding. The structure contains 3,862 exterior windows.[6] Approximately fifty metal ornaments protrude at the building's corners on five floors reminiscent of gargoyles on Gothic cathedrals.[24] The 31st-floor contains gargoyles[25] as well as replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps,[26][27] and the 61st-floor is adorned with eagles[25] as a nod to America's national bird.[28]
The design of the Chrysler Building makes extensive use of bright ""Nirosta""[29][30] stainless steel, an austenitic alloy developed in Germany by Krupp.[31][32][33][34] It was the first use of this ""18-8 stainless steel"" in an American project,[35] composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel.[34] Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle.[36] The steel was an integral part of Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: ""The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky....""[24][37] Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to evaluate the durability of the product in architecture. In 1929, the American Society for Testing Materials created an inspection committee to study its performance, which regarded the Chrysler Building as the best location to do so; a subcommittee examined the building's panels every five years until 1960, when the inspections were canceled because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.[28]

Form[edit]
The building's distinctive Art Deco crown and spire
The Chrysler Building's height and legally mandated setbacks influenced Van Alen in his design.[32] The walls of the lowermost sixteen floors rise directly from the sidewalk property lines, except for a recess on one side that gives the building a U-shaped floor plan above the fourth floor.[38][39] There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the 1916 Zoning Resolution. This gives the building the appearance of a ziggurat on one side and a U-shaped palazzo on the other.[39] Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, above which the structure is funneled into a Maltese cross shape[40] that ""blends the square shaft to the finial"", according to author and photographer Cervin Robinson.[39]
The floor plans of the first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize the amount of rental space nearest ground level, which was seen as most desirable. The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. The area between floors 28 and 31 added ""visual interest to the middle of the building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial. They provide a base to the column of the tower, effecting a transition between the blocky lower stories and the lofty shaft.""[39]

Facade[edit]
Base and shaft[edit]
The lower walls are clad with white brick, interrupted by white-marble bands in a manner similar to a basket weaving.
The ground floor exterior is covered in polished black granite from Shastone, while the three floors above it are clad in white marble from Georgia. There are two main entrances, on Lexington Avenue and on 42nd Street, each three floors high with Shastone granite surrounding each proscenium-shaped entryway. At some distance into each main entryway, there are revolving doors ""beneath intricately patterned metal and glass screens"", designed so as to embody the Art Deco tenet of amplifying the entrance's visual impact. A smaller side entrance on 43rd Street is one story high.[41][32][42] There are storefronts consisting of large Nirosta-steel-framed windows at ground level.[43][32] Office windows penetrate the second through fourth floors.[32]
The west and east elevations contain the air shafts above the fourth floor, while the north and south sides contain the receding setbacks.[32] Below the 16th floor, the facade is clad with white brick, interrupted by white-marble bands in a manner similar to basket weaving.[44][45] The inner faces of the brick walls are coated with a waterproof grout mixture measuring about 1⁄16 inch (1.6 mm) thick.[46] The windows, arranged in grids, do not have window sills, the frames being flush with the facade.[32] Between the 16th and 24th floors, the exterior exhibits vertical white brick columns that are separated by windows on each floor. This visual effect is made possible by the presence of aluminum spandrels between the columns of windows on each floor. There are abstract reliefs on the 20th through 22nd-floor spandrels, while the 24th floor contains 9-foot (2.7 m) decorative pineapples.[32]
Above the third setback, consisting of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. The section above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, serves as a podium for the main shaft of the building.[38][32] There are Nirosta-steel decorations above the setbacks.[44][39] At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments were installed to make the base look larger. These corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger.[39][40] The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders,[41][5] which both symbolize the Chrysler Corporation and serves as a visual signature of the building's Art Deco design.[6][33][41] The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet and resemble hood ornaments installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.[40]
The shaft of the tower was designed to emphasize both the horizontal and vertical: each of the tower's four sides contains three columns of windows, each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along the entirety of each side. The spandrels separating the windows contain ""alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick"", while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick.[47]

Crown and spire[edit]
Detail of the Art Deco ornamentation at the crown
The Chrysler Building is renowned for, and recognized by its terraced crown, which is an extension of the main tower.[39] Composed of seven radiating terraced arches, Van Alen's design of the crown is a cruciform groin vault of seven concentric members with transitioning setbacks.[41][48] The entire crown is clad with Nirosta steel, ribbed and riveted in a radiating sunburst pattern with many triangular vaulted windows, reminiscent of the spokes of a wheel.[41][33][49] The windows are repeated, in smaller form, on the terraced crown's seven narrow setbacks.[33][49] Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.[50] According to Robinson, the terraced crown ""continue[s] the wedding-cake layering of the building itself. This concept is carried forward from the 61st floor, whose eagle gargoyles echo the treatment of the 31st, to the spire, which extends the concept of 'higher and narrower' forward to infinite height and infinitesimal width. This unique treatment emphasizes the building's height, giving it an other worldly atmosphere reminiscent of the fantastic architecture of Coney Island or the Far East.""[39]
Television station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originated its transmission from the top of the Chrysler Building in 1938.[51] WCBS-TV transmissions were shifted to the Empire State Building in 1960[52] in response to competition from RCA's transmitter on that building.[53] For many years WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also transmitted from the Chrysler Building, but their move to the Empire State Building by the 1970s ended commercial broadcasting from the structure.[52]
The crown and spire are illuminated by a combination of fluorescent lights framing the crown's distinctive triangular windows and colored floodlights that face toward the building, allowing it to be lit in a variety of schemes for special occasions.[6] The V-shaped fluorescent ""tube lighting"" – hundreds of 480V 40W bulbs framing 120 window openings[54] – was added in 1981, although it had been part of the original design.[55][56] Until 1998, the lights were turned off at 2 a.m., but The New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6 a.m.[57] Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, turning off their lights during bird migration seasons.[58]

Interior[edit]
The interior of the building has several elements that were innovative when the structure was constructed. The partitions between the offices are soundproofed and divided into interchangeable sections, so the layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably. Pipes under the floors carry both telephone and electricity cables.[47] The topmost stories are the smallest in the building and have about 5,000 square feet (460 m2) each.[59]

Lobby[edit]
LobbyArt Deco lampEntrance doorsFuturistic digital clock
The lobby is triangular in plan,[60][61][42] connecting with entrances on Lexington Avenue, 42nd Street, and 43rd Street.[62] The lobby was the only publicly accessible part of the Chrysler Building by the 2000s.[63][64] The three entrances contain Nirosta steel doors,[65] above which are etched-glass panels that allow natural light to illuminate the space.[66] The floors contain bands of yellow travertine from Siena, which mark the path between the entrances and elevator banks.[65][61][67][66] The writer Eric Nash described the lobby as a paragon of the Art Deco style, with clear influences of German Expressionism.[5] Chrysler wanted the design to impress other architects and automobile magnates, so he imported various materials regardless of the extra costs incurred.[62][68]
The walls are covered with huge slabs of African red granite.[68][64][69] The walls also contain storefronts and doors made of Nirosta steel.[65][66] There is a wall panel dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers, and builders. Fifty different figures were modeled after workers who participated in its construction.[70] In 1999, the mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed the polyurethane coating and filled-in holes added in the 1970s.[71] Originally, Van Alen's plans for the lobby included four large supporting columns, but they were removed after Chrysler objected on the grounds that the columns made the lobby appear ""cramped"".[61] The lobby has dim lighting which combined with the appliqués of the lamps, create an intimate atmosphere and highlight the space.[68][67] Vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with Belgian blue marble and Mexican amber onyx bands, which soften and diffuse the light.[43][65][72] The marble and onyx bands are designed as inverted chevrons.[65][66]
Opposite the Lexington Avenue entrance is a security guard's desk topped by a digital clock.[67] The panel behind the desk is made of marble, surrounded by Nirosta steel.[65][66] The lobby connects to four elevator banks, each of a different design.[21][61][73] To the north and south of the security desk are terrazzo staircases leading to the second floor and basement. The stairs contain marble walls and Nirosta-steel railings.[66][73] The outer walls are flat but are clad with marble strips that are slightly angled to each other, which give the impression of being curved.[43] The inner railings of each stair are designed with zigzagging Art Deco motifs, ending at red-marble newel posts on the ground story. Above each stair are aluminum-leaf ceilings with etched-glass chandeliers.[66][73]
The ceiling contains a 110-by-67-foot (34 by 20 m) mural, Transport and Human Endeavor, designed by Edward Trumbull. The mural's theme is ""energy and man's application of it to the solution of his problems"", and it pays homage to the Golden Age of Aviation and the Machine Age.[71][61][67] The mural is painted in the shape of a ""Y"" with ocher and golden tones. The central image of the mural is a ""muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era"", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco style is manifested in characteristic triangles, sharp angles, slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns.[71] The mural depicts several silver planes, including the Spirit of St. Louis, as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself.[70][5]
When the building opened, the first and second floors housed a public exhibition of Chrysler vehicles.[74] The exhibition, known as the Chrysler Automobile Salon, was near the corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Streets, and opened in 1936.[75] The ground floor featured ""invisible glass"" display windows,[76][77][78] a 51-foot (16 m) diameter turntable upon which automobiles were displayed, and a ceiling with lights arranged in concentric circles.[76][77][79] Escalators led to the showroom's second floor where Plymouths, Dodges, and DeSotos were sold.[80] The Chrysler Salon remained operational through at least the 1960s.[81]

Elevators[edit]
Open doorsClosed doorsElevator interior with inlaid wood
There are 32 elevators in the skyscraper, clustered into four banks.[67][82] At the time of opening, 28 of the elevators were for passenger use.[83][73] Each bank serves different floors within the building, with several ""express"" elevators going from the lobby to a few landings in between, while ""local"" elevators connect the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings.[84] As per Walter Chrysler's wishes, the elevators were designed to run at a rate of 900 feet per minute (270 m/min),[85] despite the 700-foot-per-minute (210 m/min) speed restriction enforced in all city elevators at the time.[47] This restriction was loosened soon after the Empire State Building opened in 1931, as that building had also been equipped with high-speed elevators.[86] The Chrysler Building also had three of the longest elevator shafts in the world at the time of completion.[67][47]
Over the course of a year, Van Alen painstakingly designed these elevators with the assistance of L.T.M. Ralston, who was in charge of developing the elevator cabs' mechanical parts.[82] The cabs were manufactured by the Otis Elevator Company,[87] while the doors were made by the Tyler Company. The dimensions of each elevator were 5.5 feet (1.7 m) deep by 8 feet (2.4 m) wide.[82] Within the lobby, there are ziggurat-shaped Mexican onyx panels above the elevator doors.[66] The doors are designed in a lotus pattern and are clad with steel and wood.[73] When the doors are closed, they resemble ""tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies"" from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles ""an exquisite Art Deco room"".[82] These elements were influenced by ancient Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style.[83] According to Vincent Curcio, ""these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building.""[82]
Even though the woods in the elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns, each cab had a unique combination of woods.[66][67][82] Curcio stated that ""if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [the elevators] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences on the design of the entire building.""[82] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans.[83] Curcio wrote that these elevators ""are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and it is fair to say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them"".[82] Curcio compared the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side.[82] The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings.[5] Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.[88]

Basement[edit]
On the 42nd Street side of the Chrysler Building, a staircase from the street leads directly under the building to the New York City Subway's 4, ​5, ​6, <6>​, 7, <7>​​, and S trains at Grand Central–42nd Street station.[89] It is part of the structure's original design.[67][90] The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding,[91] but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway.[92] Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance.[47] Work on the new entrance started in March 1930[93] and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later.[94]
The basement also had a ""hydrozone water bottling unit"" that would filter tap water into drinkable water for the building's tenants. The drinkable water would then be bottled and shipped to higher floors.[95]

Upper stories[edit]
Cloud Club[edit]

Main article: Cloud Club
The private Cloud Club formerly occupied the 66th through 68th floors.[56] It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite.[35][96][97] Its creation was spurred by Texaco's wish for a proper restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a compromise between William Van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes.[96] A member had to be elected and, if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.[98] Texaco executives comprised most of the Cloud Club's membership.[99] The club and its dining room may have inspired the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.[100]
There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th floor with oak paneling, as well as an old English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors.[67][35][96] The main dining room had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliqués in Art Deco style.[67][97] There was a mural of a cloud on the ceiling and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side.[96][101] The 66th and 67th floors were connected by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase.[67][97] The 67th floor had an open bar with dark-wood paneling and furniture.[102] On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms.[97][102] Chrysler's dining room had a black and frosted-blue glass frieze of automobile workers.[102][67] Texaco's dining room contained a mural across two walls; one wall depicted a town in New England with a Texaco gas station, while the other depicted an oil refinery and Texaco truck. The south side of the 67th floor also contained a library with wood-paneled walls and fluted pilasters.[102] The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.[97]
In the 1950s and 1960s, members left the Cloud Club for other clubs. Texaco moved to Westchester County in 1977,[99] and the club closed two years later.[96][103] Although there have been several projects to rehabilitate the club or transform it into a disco or a gastronomic club, these plans have never materialized,[97][104] as then-owner Cooke reportedly did not want a ""conventional"" restaurant operating within the old club.[105] Tishman Speyer rented the top two floors of the old Cloud Club.[104] The old staircase has been removed, as have many of the original decorations,[97] which prompted objections from the Art Deco Society of New York.[104]

Private Chrysler offices[edit]
Originally, Walter Chrysler had a two-story apartment on the 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the loftiest bathrooms in the city.[106] The office had a medieval ambience with leaded windows, elaborate wooden doors, and heavy plaster.[67] Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing to stay at the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit.[64] Subsequently, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic.[104] In 2005, a report by The New York Times found that one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969.[107] The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.[104] Chrysler also had a unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence.[108]

Observation deck and attic[edit]
From the building's opening until 1945, it contained a 3,900 square feet (360 m2) observation deck on the 71st floor, called ""Celestial"".[109][98] For fifty cents visitors could transit its circumference through a corridor with vaulted ceilings painted with celestial motifs and bedecked with small hanging glass planets.[5][98][110] The center of the observatory contained the toolbox that Walter P. Chrysler used at the beginning of his career as a mechanic;[56][50][47][111] it was later preserved at the Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan.[112] An image of the building resembling a rocket hung above it.[98] According to a contemporary brochure, views of up to 100 miles (160 km) were possible on a clear day;[110] but the small triangular windows of the observatory created strange angles that made viewing difficult, depressing traffic. When the Empire State Building opened in 1931 with two observatories at a higher elevation, the Chrysler observatory lost its clientele.[50] After the observatory closed, it was used to house radio and television broadcasting equipment.[113] Since 1986, the old observatory has housed the office of architects Harvey Morse and Cowperwood Interests.[113][114]
The stories above the 71st floor are designed mostly for exterior appearance, functioning mainly as landings for the stairway to the spire and do not contain office space.[115] They are very narrow, have low and sloping roofs, and are only used to house radio transmitters and other mechanical and electrical equipment.[33] For example, the 73rd floor houses the motors of the elevators and a 15,000-US-gallon (57,000 L) water tank, of which 3,500 US gallons (13,000 L) are reserved for extinguishing fires.[114]


History[edit]
The Chrysler Building from the Empire State Building, both erected as part of New York City's 1920s building boom
In the mid-1920s, New York's metropolitan area surpassed London's as the world's most populous metropolitan area[116] and its population exceeded ten million by the early 1930s.[117] The era was characterized by profound social and technological changes. Consumer goods such as radio, cinema, and the automobile became widespread.[118] In 1927, Walter Chrysler's automotive company, the Chrysler Corporation, became the third-largest car manufacturer in the United States, behind Ford and General Motors.[119] The following year, Chrysler was named Time magazine's ""Person of the Year"".[120][50]
The economic boom of the 1920s and speculation in the real estate market fostered a wave of new skyscraper projects in New York City.[50] The Chrysler Building was built as part of an ongoing building boom that resulted in the city having the world's tallest building from 1908 to 1974.[121] Following the end of World War I, European and American architects came to see simplified design as the epitome of the modern era and Art Deco skyscrapers as symbolizing progress, innovation, and modernity. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before needing to be setback from the street.[a][124] This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often elaborately decorated.[125][126] Art Deco buildings were constructed for only a short period of time; but because that period was during the city's late-1920s real estate boom, the numerous skyscrapers built in the Art Deco style predominated in the city skyline, giving it the romantic quality seen in films and plays.[32] The Chrysler Building project was shaped by these circumstances.[50]

Development[edit]
Originally, the Chrysler Building was to be the Reynolds Building, a project of real estate developer and former New York state senator William H. Reynolds.[38][10][33] Prior to his involvement in planning the building, Reynolds was best known for developing Coney Island's Dreamland amusement park. When the amusement park was destroyed by a fire in 1911, Reynolds turned his attention to Manhattan real estate, where he set out to build the tallest building in the world.[38][10]

Planning[edit]
In 1921, Reynolds rented a large plot of land at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street with the intention of building a tall building on the site.[10][33][22] Reynolds did not develop the property for several years, prompting the Cooper Union to try to increase the assessed value of the property in 1924. The move, which would force Reynolds to pay more rent, was unusual because property owners usually sought to decrease their property assessments and pay fewer taxes.[127] Reynolds hired the architect William Van Alen to design a forty-story building there in 1927.[128] Van Alen's original design featured many Modernist stylistic elements, with glazed, curved windows at the corners.[38]

Van Alen was respected in his field for his work on the Albemarle Building at Broadway and 24th Street, designing it in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance.[129][130] Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances.[131] The relationship between them became tense over disagreements on how best to run the firm.[128] A 1924 article in the Architectural Review, praising the Albemarle Building's design, had mentioned Van Alen as the designer in the firm and ignored Severance's role.[132][133][134] The architects' partnership dissolved acrimoniously several months later, with lawsuits over the firm's clients and assets lasting over a year.[133][134] The rivalry influenced the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance's more traditional architectural style would otherwise have restrained Van Alen's more modern outlook.[135]

Refinement of designs[edit]
By February 2, 1928, the proposed building's height had been increased to 54 stories, which would have made it the tallest building in Midtown.[136] The proposal was changed again two weeks later, with official plans for a 63-story building.[137] A little more than a week after that, the plan was changed for the third time, with two additional stories added.[138] By this time, 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue were both hubs for construction activity, due to the removal of the Third Avenue Elevated's 42nd Street spur, which was seen as a blight on the area. The adjacent 56-story Chanin Building was also under construction. Because of the elevated spur's removal, real estate speculators believed that Lexington Avenue would become the ""Broadway of the East Side"", causing a ripple effect that would spur developments farther east.[139]
In April 1928, Reynolds signed a 67-year lease for the plot and finalized the details of his ambitious project.[140] Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a base with first-floor showroom windows that would be triple-height, and above would be 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, to create the impression that the tower was floating in mid-air.[33][141] Reynolds's main contribution to the building's design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown, despite Van Alen's initial opposition;[5] the metal-and-crystal crown would have looked like ""a jeweled sphere"" at night.[55] Originally, the skyscraper would have risen 808 feet (246 m), with 67 floors.[6][142][141] These plans were approved in June 1928.[143] Van Alen's drawings were unveiled in the following August and published in a magazine run by the American Institute of Architects (AIA).[144]
Reynolds ultimately devised an alternate design for the Reynolds Building, which was published in August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.[33]

Final plans and start of construction[edit]
With the design complete, groundbreaking for the Reynolds Building took place on September 19, 1928,[145]
but by late 1928, Reynolds did not have the means to carry on construction.[146] Walter Chrysler offered to buy the building in early October 1928,[147] and Reynolds sold the plot, lease, plans, and architect's services to Chrysler on October 15, 1928,[41][146][16] for more than $2.5 million.[148] That day, the Goodwin Construction Company began demolition of what had been built.[149][16] A contract was awarded on October 28,[150] and demolition was completed on November 9.[149] Chrysler's initial plans for the building were similar to Reynolds's, but with the 808-foot building having 68 floors instead of 67. The plans entailed a ground-floor pedestrian arcade; a facade of stone below the fifth floor and brick-and-terracotta above; and a three-story bronze-and-glass ""observation dome"" at the top.[41][16] However, Chrysler wanted a more progressive design, and he worked with Van Alen to redesign the skyscraper to be 925 ft (282 m) tall.[151] At the new height, Chrysler's building would be taller than the 792-foot (241 m) Woolworth Building, a building in lower Manhattan that was the world's tallest at the time.[152][16] At one point, Chrysler had requested that Van Alen shorten the design by ten floors, but reneged on that decision after realizing that the increased height would also result in increased publicity.[153]

From late 1928 to early 1929, modifications to the design of the dome continued.[128] In March 1929, the press published details of an ""artistic dome"" that had the shape of a giant thirty-pointed star, which would be crowned by a sculpture five meters high.[85][33][154] The final design of the dome included several arches and triangular windows.[128] Lower down, various architectural details were modeled after Chrysler automobile products, such as the hood ornaments of the Plymouth (see § Facade).[33][6] The building's gargoyles on the 31st floor and the eagles on the 61st floor, were created to represent flight,[25] and to embody the machine age of the time.[33][6] Even the topmost needle was built using a process similar to one Chrysler used to manufacture his cars, with precise ""hand craftmanship"".[155] In his autobiography, Chrysler says he suggested that his building be taller than the Eiffel Tower.[156][10]
Meanwhile, excavation of the new building's 69-foot-deep (21 m) foundation began in mid-November 1928[157][158] and was completed in mid-January 1929, when bedrock was reached.[149] A total of 105,000,000 pounds (48,000,000 kg) of rock and 36,000,000 pounds (16,000,000 kg) of soil were excavated for the foundation, equal to 63% of the future building's weight.[158] Construction of the building proper began on January 21, 1929.[149] The Carnegie Steel Company provided the steel beams, the first of which was installed on March 27; and by April 9, the first upright beams had been set into place.[158] The steel structure was ""a few floors"" high by June 1929, 35 floors high by early August,[158] and completed by September.[50] Despite a frantic steelwork construction pace of about four floors per week,[159] no workers died during the construction of the skyscraper's steelwork.[160] Chrysler lauded this achievement, saying, ""It is the first time that any structure in the world has reached such a height, yet the entire steel construction was accomplished without loss of life"".[160] In total, 391,881 rivets were used,[161] and approximately 3,826,000 bricks were laid to create the non-loadbearing walls of the skyscraper.[162] Walter Chrysler personally financed the construction with his income from his car company.[163] The Chrysler Building's height officially surpassed the Woolworth's on October 16, 1929, thereby becoming the world's tallest structure.[164]

Competition for ""world's tallest building"" title[edit]
The same year that the Chrysler Building's construction started, banker George L. Ohrstrom proposed the construction of a 47-story office building at 40 Wall Street downtown, designed by Van Alen's former partner Severance. Shortly thereafter, Ohrstrom expanded his project to 60 floors, but it was still shorter than the Woolworth and Chrysler buildings.[152] That April, Severance increased 40 Wall's height to 840 feet (260 m) with 62 floors, exceeding the Woolworth's height by 48 feet (15 m) and the Chrysler's by 32 feet (9.8 m).[152] 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building started competing for the title of ""world's tallest building"".[30][165][103] The Empire State Building, on 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, entered the competition in 1929.[166] The race was defined by at least five other proposals, although only the Empire State Building would survive the Wall Street Crash of 1929.[167][b] The ""Race into the Sky"", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, which helped fuel the building boom in major cities.[166] Van Alen expanded the Chrysler Building's height to 925 feet (282 m), prompting Severance to increase the height of 40 Wall Street to 927 feet (283 m) in April 1929.[103][169] Construction of 40 Wall Street began that May and was completed twelve months later.[152]
In response, Van Alen obtained permission for a 125-foot-long (38 m) spire.[170][171][c] He had it secretly constructed inside the frame of the Chrysler Building,[44][169][153] ensuring that Severance did not know the Chrysler Building's ultimate height until the end.[30] The spire was delivered to the site in four sections.[170] On October 23, 1929, one week after the Chrysler Building surpassed the Woolworth Building's height and one day before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the spire was assembled. According to one account, ""the bottom section of the spire was hoisted to the top of the building's dome and lowered into the 66th floor of the building.""[152] Then, within 90 minutes the rest of the spire's pieces were raised and riveted in sequence,[172] raising the tower to 1,046 feet.[44][173][174] Van Alen, who witnessed the process from the street along with its engineers and Walter Chrysler,[173] compared the experience to watching a butterfly leaving its cocoon.[153][174] In the October 1930 edition of Architectural Forum, Van Alen explained the design and construction of the crown and needle:[175][50]

A high spire structure with a needle-like termination was designed to surmount the dome. This is 185 feet high and 8 feet square at its base. It was made up of four corner angles, with light angle strut and diagonal members, all told weighing 27 tons. It was manifestly impossible to assemble this structure and hoist it as a unit from the ground, and equally impossible to hoist it in sections and place them as such in their final positions. Besides, it would be more spectacular, for publicity value, to have this cloud-piercing needle appear unexpectedly.
The steel tip brought the Chrysler Building to a height of 1,046 feet (319 m), greatly exceeding 40 Wall Street's height.[176][44] Contemporary news media did not write of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection. Even the New York Herald Tribune, which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised.[177]
Chrysler realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire.[169] However, the Empire State's developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building[178] and acquired additional plots to support that building's height extension.[179][180] Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of 1,050 feet (320 m), higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck at 783 feet (239 m).[178]

Completion[edit]
The Chrysler Building in 1932
In January 1930, it was announced that the Chrysler Corporation would maintain satellite offices in the Chrysler Building during Automobile Show Week.[181] The skyscraper was never intended to become the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters, which remained in Detroit.[182] The first leases by outside tenants were announced in April 1930, before the building was officially completed.[183][1] The building was formally opened on May 27, 1930, in a ceremony that coincided with the 42nd Street Property Owners and Merchants Association's meeting that year. In the lobby of the building, a bronze plaque that read ""in recognition of Mr. Chrysler's contribution to civic advancement"" was unveiled. Former Governor Smith, former Assemblyman Martin G. McCue, and 42nd Street Association president George W. Sweeney were among those in attendance.[1][2] By June, it was reported that 65% of the available space had been leased.[184] By August, the building was declared complete, but the New York City Department of Construction did not mark it as finished until February 1932.[1]
The added height of the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest building in the world and the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure.[178] The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than 1,000 feet (300 m)[185] and, by extension, the world's first supertall skyscraper.[4] As one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states.[186] The tower remained the world's tallest for 11 months after its completion.[4][187] The Chrysler Building was appraised at $14 million, but was exempt from city taxes per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union.[188] The city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, but Cooper Union had opposed that measure.[189] Because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.[64] While the Chrysler Corporation was a tenant, it was not involved in the construction or ownership of the Chrysler Building; rather, the tower was a project of Walter P. Chrysler for his children.[33][44] In his autobiography, Chrysler wrote that he wanted to erect the building ""so that his sons would have something to be responsible for"".[156][10]
Van Alen's satisfaction at these accomplishments was likely muted by Walter Chrysler's later refusal to pay the balance of his architectural fee.[33] Chrysler alleged that Van Alen had received bribes from suppliers, and Van Alen had not signed any contracts with Walter Chrysler when he took over the project.[128] Van Alen sued and the courts ruled in his favor, requiring Chrysler to pay Van Alen $840,000, or six percent of the total budget of the building.[190] However, the lawsuit against Chrysler markedly diminished Van Alen's reputation as an architect, which, along with the effects of the Great Depression and negative criticism, ended up ruining his career.[191][128] Van Alen ended his career as professor of sculpture at the nearby Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and died in 1954. According to author Neal Bascomb, ""The Chrysler Building was his greatest accomplishment, and the one that guaranteed his obscurity.""[128]
The Chrysler Building's distinction as the world's tallest building was short-lived. John Raskob realized the 1,050-foot Empire State Building would only be 4 feet (1.2 m) taller than the Chrysler Building,[178] and Raskob was afraid that Walter Chrysler might try to ""pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute.""[192] Another revision brought the Empire State Building's roof to 1,250 feet (380 m), making it the tallest building in the world by far[193][194] when it opened on May 1, 1931.[3] However, the Chrysler Building is still the world's tallest steel-supported brick building.[6] The Chrysler Building fared better commercially than the Empire State Building did: by 1935, the Chrysler had already rented 70 percent of its floor area.[195] By contrast, Empire State had only leased 23 percent of its space[196] and was popularly derided as the ""Empty State Building"".[197]

Height comparison of buildings in New York City
The Chrysler family inherited the property after the death of Walter Chrysler in 1940, with the property being under the ownership of W.P. Chrysler Building Corporation.[198] In 1944, the corporation filed plans to build a 38-story annex to the east of the building, at 666 Third Avenue.[199] In 1949, this was revised to a 32-story annex costing $9 million.[200] The annex building, designed by Reinhard, Hofmeister & Walquist,[201][202] had a facade similar to that of the original Chrysler Building. The stone for the original building was no longer manufactured, and had to be specially replicated.[203] Construction started on the annex in June 1950,[204] and the first tenants started leasing in June 1951.[205] The building itself was completed by 1952,[201] and a sky bridge connecting the two buildings' seventh floors was built in 1959.[206]
The family sold the building in 1953 to William Zeckendorf[207][208] for its assessed price of $18 million.[209] The 1953 deal included the annex and the nearby Graybar Building, which, along with the Chrysler Building, sold for a combined $52 million. The new owners were Zeckendorf's company Webb and Knapp, who held a 75% interest in the sale, and the Graysler Corporation, who held a 25% stake. At the time, it was reported to be the largest real estate sale in New York City's history.[210] In 1957, the Chrysler Building, its annex, and the Graybar Building were sold for $66 million to Lawrence Wien's realty syndicate, setting a new record for the largest sale in the city.[211]

The Chrysler Building in 1965
In 1960, the complex was purchased by Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo,[212] who received a mortgage from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.[213] The next year, the building's stainless steel elements, including the needle, crown, gargoyles, and entrance doors, were polished for the first time.[214][215] A group of ten workers steam-cleaned the facade below the 30th floor, and manually cleaned the portion of the tower above the 30th floor, for a cost of about $200,000.[215] Under Goldman and DiLorenzo's operation, the building began to develop leaks and cracked walls, and about 1,200 cubic yards (920 m3) of garbage piled up in the basement. The scale of the deterioration led one observer to say that the Chrysler Building was being operated ""like a tenement in the South Bronx"".[208][216] The Chrysler Building remained profitable until 1974, when the owners faced increasing taxes and fuel costs.[217]

1970s to mid-1990s[edit]
Foreclosure proceedings against the building began in August 1975, when Goldman and DiLorenzo defaulted on the $29 million first mortgage and a $15 million second mortgage.[218] The building was about 17 percent vacant at the time.[219] Massachusetts Mutual acquired the Chrysler Building for $35 million,[220] purchasing all the outstanding debt on the building via several transactions.[221] The next year, the Chrysler Building was designated as a National Historic Landmark.[7][222] Texaco, one of the building's major tenants, was relocating to Westchester County, New York, by then,[223] vacating hundreds of thousands of square feet at the Chrysler Building.[217][219] In early 1978, Mass Mutual devised plans to renovate the facade, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, elevators, lobby murals, and Cloud Club headquarters for $23 million.[220][224][221] At a press conference announcing the renovation, mayor Ed Koch proclaimed that ""the steel eagles and the gargoyles of the Chrysler Building are all shouting the renaissance of New York"".[208][220] Massachusetts Mutual had hired Josephine Sokolski, who had proposed modifying Van Alen's original lobby design substantially.[225][226]

After the renovation was announced, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) considered designating the Chrysler Building as a city landmark.[220] Though Mass Mutual had proclaimed ""sensitivity and respect"" for the building's architecture,[220] it had opposed the city landmark designation, concerned that the designation would hinder leasing.[227][208] At the time, the building had 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2) of vacant floor space, representing 40% of the total floor area.[220] The owners hired the Edward S. Gordon Company as the building's leasing agent, and the firm leased 750,000 square feet (70,000 m2) of vacant space within five years.[228] The LPC designated the lobby and facade as city landmarks in September 1978.[208] Massachusetts Mutual had hired Josephine Sokolski to renovate the lobby, but the LPC objected that many aspects of Sokolski's planned redesign had deviated too much from Van Alen's original design.[226][229] As a result of these disputes, the renovation of the lobby was delayed.[229]The Chrysler Building seen from ground levelThe building was sold again in August 1979, this time to entrepreneur and Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, in a deal that also transferred ownership of the Los Angeles Kings and Lakers to Jerry Buss.[230] At the time, the building was 96 percent occupied. The new owners hired Kenneth Kleiman of Descon Interiors to redesign the lobby and elevator cabs in a style that was much closer to Van Alen's original design.[225][231] Cooke also oversaw the completion of a lighting scheme at the pinnacle, which had been part of the original design but was never completed.[231] The lighting system, consisting of 580 fluorescent tubes installed within the triangular windows of the top stories, was first illuminated in September 1981.[231][232]
Cooke next hired Hoffman Architects to restore the exterior and spire from 1995 to 1996.[231][233] The joints in the now-closed observation deck were polished, and the facade restored, as part of a $1.5 million project. Some damaged steel strips of the needle were replaced and several parts of the gargoyles were re-welded together.[233] The cleaning received the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for 1997.[234] Cooke died in April 1997, and his mortgage lender Fuji Bank moved to foreclose on the building the next month.[235] Shortly after Fuji announced its intent to foreclose, several developers and companies announced that they were interested in buying the building.[236] Ultimately, 20 potential buyers submitted bids to buy the Chrysler Building and several adjacent buildings.[237]

Late 1990s to 2010s[edit]
Tishman Speyer Properties and the Travelers Insurance Group won the right to buy the building in November 1997, having submitted a bid for about $220 million (equal to $420 million in 2023). Tishman Speyer had negotiated a 150-year lease from the Cooper Union, which continued to own the land under the Chrysler Building.[207][238] In 1998, Tishman Speyer announced that it had hired Beyer Blinder Belle to renovate the building and incorporate it into a commercial complex known as the Chrysler Center.[231][239] As part of this project, EverGreene Architectural Arts restored the Transport and Human Endeavor mural in the lobby, which had been covered up during the late-1970s renovation.[231][71] The renovation cost $100 million.[240] In 2001, a 75 percent stake in the building was sold for US$300 million (equal to $520 million in 2023) to TMW, the German arm of an Atlanta-based investment fund.[241] The building was 95 percent occupied by 2005.[242][243]
In June 2008, it was reported that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council was in negotiations to buy TMW's 75 percent ownership stake, Tishman Speyer's 15 percent stake, and a share of the Trylons retail structure next door for US$800 million.[244] The transaction was completed the next month, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council assumed a 90 percent stake in the building, with Tishman Speyer retaining 10 percent.[245][246] Tishman continued to manage the building and paid the Cooper Union $7.5 million a year.[242] From 2010 to 2011, the building's energy, plumbing, and waste management systems were renovated. This resulted in a 21 percent decrease in the building's total energy consumption and 64 percent decrease in water consumption. In addition, 81 percent of waste was recycled. In 2012, the building received a LEED Gold accreditation from the U.S. Green Building Council, which recognized the building's environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.[247]

RFR Holding operation[edit]
The Abu Dhabi Investment Council and Tishman Speyer put the Chrysler Building's leasehold for sale again in January 2019.[248] That March, the media reported that Aby Rosen's RFR Holding LLC, in a joint venture with the Austrian Signa Group, had reached an agreement to purchase the leasehold[249][250] at a steeply discounted $150 million.[251] In exchange, Rosen had to pay the Cooper Union $32.5 million a year, a steep increase from the rate the previous leaseholders had paid.[59][252]
Rosen initially planned to convert the building into a hotel,[253] but he dropped these plans in April 2019, citing difficulties with the ground lease.[254] Rosen then announced plans for an observation deck on the 61st-story setback,[255] which the LPC approved in May 2020.[256] He also wanted to reopen the Cloud Club and attract multiple restaurateurs.[59] Rosen sought to renegotiate the terms of his ground lease with Cooper Union in 2020,[257] and he evicted storeowners from all of the building's shops in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to renovate the retail space.[242][258] To attract tenants following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020,[259] he converted the Chrysler Building's ground-floor space into a tenant amenity center.[260] RFR estimated that it had spent $170 million to renovate the building.[59] RFR and Signa attempted to restructure the ground lease again in 2021 and 2023, both times without success.[59][261] By then, according to an anonymous source cited by Curbed, RFR was losing an estimated $1 million a month from the Chrysler Building's operation.[59]
In December 2023, Signa's creditors ordered the company to sell its stake in the Chrysler Building, following Signa's insolvency.[262] RFR offered to buy Signa's ownership stake for a nominal fee of $1.[261] Meanwhile, RFR sought to lease the building's retail space to luxury stores, signing their first luxury tenant in March 2024.[263] By mid-2024, the building was aging significantly, and RFR had listed about 650,000 square feet (60,000 m2) of the Chrysler Building's office space as being ""immediately available for rent"".[252][264] The New York Times reported that employees had complained about pest infestations, fountains with brown water, weak cellular reception, elevator delays, and poor natural lighting.[264] Additionally, it would cost millions of dollars to upgrade the building to meet modern energy-efficiency codes.[242] The Cooper Union moved to terminate RFR's ground lease of the Chrysler Building in September 2024, and RFR sued the college to prevent the termination of its leasehold.[261][265] In its lawsuit, RFR claimed that the Cooper Union had driven away some tenants and had directed other tenants to make rent payments to the college rather than to RFR.[266] Subsequently, the Cooper Union requested that RFR be evicted,[267] and a state judge ordered tenants to pay rent to the Cooper Union that October.[268] RFR's lease was ultimately terminated in January 2025.[269]

Chrysler Center[edit]
Chrysler East (on the left), seen next to the original buildingChrysler Trylons
Chrysler Center is the building complex consisting of the Chrysler Building to the west, Chrysler Building East to the east, and the Chrysler Trylons commercial pavilion in the middle. After Tishman Speyer had acquired the entire complex, the firm renovated it completely from 1998 to 2000.[270]
The structure at 666 Third Avenue, known as the Kent Building at the time, was renovated and renamed Chrysler Building East.[270] This International Style building, built in 1952,[201] is 432 feet (132 m) high and has 32 floors.[271][272] The mechanical systems were modernized and the interior was modified.[272][273] Postmodern architect Philip Johnson designed a new facade of dark-blue glass, which was placed about 4 inches (100 mm) in front of the Kent Building's existing facade.[231] The structure did not resemble its western neighbor; Johnson explained that he did not ""even like the architecture"" of the Chrysler Building, despite acknowledging it as ""the most loved building in New York"".[274][239] His design also included a 135,000-square-foot (12,500 m2) extension.[272][273] which surrounded the elevator core on the western end of the original Kent Building.[274][239] The expansion utilized 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) of unused air rights above the buildings in the middle of the block.[231] The Kent Building was not a New York City designated landmark, unlike the Chrysler Building, so its renovation did not require the LPC's approval.[240] After the addition, the total area of the Kent building was 770,000 square feet (72,000 m2).[275]
A new building, also designed by Philip Johnson, was built between the original skyscraper and the annex.[276] This became the Chrysler Trylons, a commercial pavilion three stories high with a retail area of 22,000 square feet (2,000 m2).[270] Its design consists of three triangular glass ""trylons"" measuring 57 ft (17 m), 68 ft (21 m), and 73 ft (22 m) tall; each is slanted in a different direction.[277][270] The trylons are supported by vertical steel mullions measuring 10 in (250 mm) wide; between the mullions are 535 panes of reflective gray glass.[270] The retail structures themselves are placed on either side of the trylons.[277] Due to the complexity of the structural work, structural engineer Severud Associates built a replica at Rimouski, Quebec. Johnson designed the Chrysler Trylons as ""a monument for 42nd Street [...] to give you the top of the Chrysler Building at street level.""[270]
After these modifications, the total leasable area of the complex was 2,062,772 square feet (191,637.8 m2).[275] The total cost of this project was about one hundred million dollars.[270] This renovation has won several awards and commendations, including an Energy Star rating from the Environmental Protection Agency;[278] a LEED Gold designation;[247] and the Skyscraper Museum Outstanding Renovation Award of 2001.[279]

Tenants[edit]
In January 1930, the Chrysler Corporation opened satellite offices in the Chrysler Building during Automobile Show Week.[181] In addition to the Chrysler Salon product showroom on the first and second floors, the building had a lounge and a theater for showing films of Chrysler products.[80] Other original large tenants included Time, Inc. and Texaco oil.[280] Needing more office space,[281] Time moved to Rockefeller Center in 1937.[282] Texaco relocated to a more suburban workplace in Purchase, New York, in 1977.[99] In addition, the offices of Shaw Walker and J. S. Bache & Company were immediately atop the Chrysler Salon, while A. B. Dick, Pan American World Airways, Adams Hats, Schrafft's, and Florsheim Shoes also had offices in the building.[283]
By the 21st century, many of the Chrysler Building's tenants leased space there because of the building's historical stature, rather than because of its amenities.[264] Notable modern tenants include:

Creative Artists Agency[284]
Clyde & Co[285]
InterMedia Partners[286]
IWG[287]
PA Consulting[288]
Troutman Sanders[246]
YES Network[289]
Impact [edit]
Reception[edit]
The completed Chrysler Building garnered mixed reviews in the press. Van Alen was hailed as the ""Doctor of Altitude"" by Architect magazine, while architect Kenneth Murchison called Van Alen the ""Ziegfeld of his profession"", comparing him to popular Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.[129][290] The building was praised for being ""an expression of the intense activity and vibrant life of our day"", and for ""teem[ing] with the spirit of modernism, ... the epitome of modern business life, stand[ing] for progress in architecture and in modern building methods.""[47][291][292] An anonymous critic wrote in Architectural Forum's October 1930 issue: ""The Chrysler...stands by itself, something apart and alone. It is simply the realization, the fulfillment in metal and masonry, of a one-man dream, a dream of such ambitions and such magnitude as to defy the comprehension and the criticism of ordinary men or by ordinary standards.""[50][115] Walter Chrysler himself regarded the building as a ""monument to me"".[264]
The journalist George S. Chappell called the Chrysler's design ""distinctly a stunt design, evolved to make the man in the street look up"".[129][67] Douglas Haskell stated that the building ""embodies no compelling, organic idea"",[129] and alleged that Van Alen had abandoned ""some of his best innovations in behalf of stunts and new 'effects'"".[41] Others compared the Chrysler Building to ""an upended swordfish"",[26][293] or claimed it had a ""Little Nemo""-like design.[26] Lewis Mumford, a supporter of the International Style and one of the foremost architectural critics of the United States at the time, despised the building for its ""inane romanticism, meaningless voluptuousness, [and] void symbolism"".[118][294][47] The public also had mixed reviews of the Chrysler Building, as Murchison wrote: ""Some think it's a freak; some think it's a stunt.""[191][290] The architectural professor Gail Fenske said that, although the Chrysler Building was criticized as ""too theatrical"" at the time of its completion, the general public quickly took a liking to ""the city's crowning skyscraper"".[242]
Later reviews were more positive. Architect Robert A. M. Stern wrote that the Chrysler Building was ""the most extreme example of the [1920s and 1930s] period's stylistic experimentation"", as contrasted with 40 Wall Street and its ""thin"" detailing.[295] George H. Douglas wrote in 2004 that the Chrysler Building ""remains one of the most appealing and awe-inspiring of skyscrapers"".[185] Architect Le Corbusier called the building ""hot jazz in stone and steel"".[61] Architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable stated that the building had ""a wonderful, decorative, evocative aesthetic"", while Paul Goldberger noted the ""compressed, intense energy"" of the lobby, the ""magnificent"" elevators, and the ""magical"" view from the crown.[296] Anthony W. Robins said the Chrysler Building was ""one-of-a-kind, staggering, romantic, soaring, the embodiment of 1920s skyscraper pizzazz, the great symbol of Art Deco New York"".[297] Kim Velsey of Curbed said that the building ""is unabashedly over the top"" because of ""its steel gargoyles, Moroccan marble lobby, and illuminated spire"".[59]
The LPC said that the tower ""embodies the romantic essence of the New York City skyscraper"".[10] Pauline Frommer, in the travel guide Frommer's, gave the building an ""exceptional"" recommendation, saying: ""In the Chrysler Building we see the roaring-twenties version of what Alan Greenspan called 'irrational exuberance'—a last burst of corporate headquarter building before stocks succumbed to the thudding crash of 1929.""[298]

As icon[edit]
The Chrysler Building appears in several films set in New York[299] and is widely considered one of the most positively acclaimed buildings in the city.[300][33] A 1996 survey of New York architects revealed it as their favorite, and The New York Times described it in 2005 as ""the single most important emblem of architectural imagery on the New York skyline"".[118] In mid-2005, the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan asked 100 architects, builders, critics, engineers, historians, and scholars, among others, to choose their 10 favorites among 25 of the city's towers. The Chrysler Building came in first place, with 90 respondents placing it on their ballots.[301] In 2007, the building ranked ninth among 150 buildings in the AIA's List of America's Favorite Architecture.[302]
The Chrysler Building is widely heralded as an Art Deco icon. Fodor's New York City 2010 described the building as being ""one of the great art deco masterpieces""[303] which ""wins many a New Yorker's vote for the city's most iconic and beloved skyscraper"".[63] Frommer's states that the Chrysler was ""one of the most impressive Art Deco buildings ever constructed"".[298] Insight Guides' 2016 edition maintains that the Chrysler Building is considered among the city's ""most beautiful"" buildings.[304] Its distinctive profile has inspired similar skyscrapers worldwide, including One Liberty Place in Philadelphia,[305] Two Prudential Plaza in Chicago,[306] and the Al Kazim Towers in Dubai.[307] In addition, the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains the ""Chrysler Tower"",[308] a replica of the Chrysler Building measuring 35 or 40 stories tall.[309][310] A portion of the hotel's interior was also designed to resemble the Chrysler Building's interior.[309]

In media[edit]
While seen in many films, the Chrysler Building almost never appears as a main setting in them, prompting architect and author James Sanders to quip it should win ""the Award for Best Supporting Skyscraper"".[299] The building was supposed to be featured in the 1933 film King Kong, but only makes a cameo at the end thanks to its producers opting for the Empire State Building in a central role.[299] The Chrysler Building appears in the background of The Wiz (1978); as the setting of much of Q - The Winged Serpent (1982); in the initial credits of The Shadow of the Witness (1987); and during or after apocalyptic events in Independence Day (1996), Armageddon (1998), Deep Impact (1998), Godzilla (1998), and A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).[299] The building also appears in other films, such as Spider-Man (2002),[311] Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007),[312] Two Weeks Notice (2002),[299] The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010),[313] The Avengers (2012)[314] and Men in Black 3 (2012).[264][315] The building is mentioned in the number ""It's the Hard Knock Life"" for the musical Annie,[316] and it is the setting for the post-game content in the Squaresoft video game Parasite Eve.[317] In addition, the introductory scenes of the TV show Sex and the City depict the Chrysler Building.[264]
In December 1929, Walter Chrysler hired Margaret Bourke-White to take publicity images from a scaffold 400 feet (120 m) high.[318][319][320] She was deeply inspired by the new structure and especially smitten by the massive eagle's-head figures projecting off the building.[321] According to one account, Bourke-White wanted to live in the building for the duration of the photo shoot, but the only person able to do so was the janitor, so she was instead relegated to co-leasing a studio with Time Inc.[296] In 1930, several of her photographs were used in a special report on skyscrapers in the then-new Fortune magazine.[322] Bourke-White worked in a 61st-floor studio designed by John Vassos[318][296] until she was evicted in 1934.[296] That year, Bourke-White's partner Oscar Graubner took a famous photo called ""Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building"", which depicts her taking a photo of the city's skyline while sitting on one of the 61st-floor eagle ornaments.[318][323] On October 5, 1998, Christie's auctioned the photograph for $96,000.[324]
The Chrysler Building has been the subject of other photographs as well. During a January 1931 dance organized by the Society of Beaux-Arts, six architects, including Van Alen, were photographed while wearing costumes resembling the buildings that each architect designed.[325] In 1991, the photographer Annie Leibovitz took pictures of the dancer David Parsons reclining on a ledge near the top of the building.[326]

Notes[edit]


^ As per the 1916 Zoning Act, the wall of any given tower that faces a street could only rise to a certain height, proportionate to the street's width, at which point the building had to be set back by a given proportion. This system of setbacks would continue until the tower reaches a floor level in which that level's floor area was 25% that of the ground level's area. After that 25% threshold was reached, the building could rise without restriction.[122] This law was superseded by the 1961 Zoning Resolution.[123]

^ These proposals included the 100-story Metropolitan Life North Building; a 1,050-foot (320 m) tower built by Abraham E. Lefcourt at Broadway and 49th Street; a 100-story tower developed by the Fred F. French Company on Sixth Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets; an 85-story tower to be developed on the site of the Belmont Hotel near Grand Central Terminal; and the Noyes-Schulte Company's proposed tower on Broadway between Duane and Worth Streets. Only one of these projects was even partially completed: the base of the Metropolitan Life North Building.[168]

^ According to Robert A. M. Stern, the spire was 185 feet (56 m) long.[153]

What is the Chikungunya virus?,"The Chikungunya virus is a mosquito-borne virus that was first identified in the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius in 1953. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, which are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions.

The virus causes a viral illness known as Chikungunya fever, which is characterized by fever, joint pain, swelling, headache, and muscle pain. The illness usually lasts for several days to a few weeks, and most people recover without any long-term complications.

However, in some cases, the virus can cause more severe illness, including arthritis and other joint problems that can last for months or years. These cases are often referred to as ""post-viral arthritis"" or ""Chikungunya arthritis.""

The Chikungunya virus has been found in many countries around the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. It has caused outbreaks in many areas, including India, where an estimated 200,000 cases were reported in 2006. In recent years, the virus has become more prevalent in the Americas, with cases reported in several countries, including the United States.

It is important to note that while the Chikungunya virus is a viral illness, it is not the same as the Zika virus, which can also cause similar symptoms and has been linked to birth defects in pregnant women.",False,https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html,"

"
What is the ENIAC?,"The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was a large-scale electronic computer developed in the United States during World War II. It was the first general-purpose electronic computer, meaning that it was designed to perform a variety of mathematical and logical operations, rather than being specialized for a specific task. The ENIAC was a significant technological achievement in its time, and its development had a profound impact on the field of computer science. Here are some specific details and examples of the ENIAC:

* Development: The ENIAC was developed in the United States by the Army Ordnance Department between 1943 and 1945. It was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who were working at the University of Pennsylvania.
* Size: The ENIAC was a large machine, measuring 27 feet (8.2 meters) long, 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide, and 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall. It weighed approximately 30 tons.
* Speed: The ENIAC was capable of performing approximately 5,000 calculations per second, which was a significant improvement over the mechanical computers of the time.
* Power: The ENIAC required a significant amount of power to operate, consuming approximately 180 kilowatts of electricity.
* Users: The ENIAC was used by the United States Army for a variety of military applications, including bombsight calibration, artillery range prediction, and missile guidance. It was also used by the National Security Agency for codebreaking.
* Inventors: John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert are considered the inventors of the ENIAC, although the actual design and development of the machine were carried out by a team of engineers and technicians.
* Legacy: The ENIAC was a significant technological achievement in its time, and its development had a profound impact on the field of computer science. It paved the way for the development of modern computers and is considered a milestone in the history of computing.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC,"

ENIAC (/ˈɛniæk/; Electronic Numerical  Integrator and Computer)[1][2] was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, completed in 1945.[3][4] Other computers had some of these features, but ENIAC was the first to have them all. It was Turing-complete and able to solve ""a large class of numerical problems"" through reprogramming.[5][6]
ENIAC was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory).[7][8] However, its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.[9][10]
ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10, 1945.[11]
ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946, having cost $487,000 (equivalent to $6,900,000 in 2023), and called a ""Giant Brain"" by the press.[12] It had a speed on the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines.[13]
ENIAC was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. It was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland in 1947, where it was in continuous operation until 1955.
The 1948 Manchester Baby was the first machine to contain all the elements essential to a modern electronic digital computer, as it could be reprogrammed electronically to hold stored programs instead of requiring setting of switches to program as ENIAC did.


Development and design[edit]
ENIAC's design and construction was financed by the United States Army, Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Command, led by Major General Gladeon M.Barnes. The total cost was about $487,000, equivalent to $6,900,000 in 2023.[14] The conception of ENIAC began in June 1941, when Friden calculators and differential analyzers were used by the United States Army Ordnance Department to compute firing tables for artillery, which was done by graduate students under John Mauchly's supervision. Mauchly began to wonder if electronics could be applied to mathematics for faster calculations. He partnered up with research associate J. Presper Eckert, as Mauchly wasn't an electronics expert, to draft an electronic computer that could work at an excellent pace. Later in August 1942, Mauchly proposed an all-electronic calculating machine that could help the U.S. Army calculate complex ballistics tables.[15][16] The U.S. Army Ordnance accepted their plan, giving the University of Pennsylvania a six-months research contract for $61,700.[17] The construction contract was signed on June 5, 1943; work on the computer began in secret at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering[18] the following month, under the code name ""Project PX"", with John Grist Brainerd as principal investigator. Herman H. Goldstine persuaded the Army to fund the project, which put him in charge to oversee it for them.[19] Assembly for the computer began in June 1944.[17] Later in September of that year, Eckert and Mauchly completed their conception on the computer.[20] Construction for the computer was complete in May 1945, and testing for it began at the Moore School. Later in November of that year, the duo, along with John Brainerd and Herman Goldstine, issued the first confidential published report on the computer, which talks about how it worked and the methods by which it was programmed.[16]
ENIAC was designed by Ursinus College physics professor John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of the University of Pennsylvania, U.S.[21] The team of design engineers assisting the development included Robert F. Shaw (function tables), Jeffrey Chuan Chu (divider/square-rooter), Thomas Kite Sharpless (master programmer), Frank Mural (master programmer), Arthur Burks (multiplier), Harry Huskey (reader/printer) and Jack Davis (accumulators).[22] Significant development work was undertaken by the female mathematicians who handled the bulk of the ENIAC programming: Jean Jennings, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman, Betty Snyder, Frances Bilas, and Kay McNulty.[23] In 1946, the researchers resigned from the University of Pennsylvania and formed the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation.
ENIAC was a large, modular computer, composed of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators that could not only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or trays, as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it could trigger different operations, depending on the sign of a computed result.

Components[edit]
By the end of its operation in 1956, ENIAC contained 18,000 vacuum tubes, 7,200 crystal diodes, 1,500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 30 short tons (27 t), was roughly 8 ft (2 m) tall, 3 ft (1 m) deep, and 100 ft (30 m) long, occupied 300 sq ft (28 m2) and consumed 150 kW of electricity.[24][25] Input was possible from an IBM card reader and an IBM card punch was used for output. These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an IBM accounting machine, such as the IBM 405. While ENIAC had no system to store memory in its inception, these punch cards could be used for external memory storage.[26] In 1953, a 100-word magnetic-core memory built by the Burroughs Corporation was added to ENIAC.[27]
ENIAC used ten-position ring counters to store digits; each digit required 36 vacuum tubes, 10 of which were the dual triodes making up the flip-flops of the ring counter. Arithmetic was performed by ""counting"" pulses with the ring counters and generating carry pulses if the counter ""wrapped around"", the idea being to electronically emulate the operation of the digit wheels of a mechanical adding machine.[28]
ENIAC had 20 ten-digit signed accumulators, which used ten's complement representation and could perform 5,000 simple addition or subtraction operations between any of them and a source (e.g., another accumulator or a constant transmitter) per second. It was possible to connect several accumulators to run simultaneously, so the peak speed of operation was potentially much higher, due to parallel operation.[29][30]

It was possible to wire the carry of one accumulator into another accumulator to perform arithmetic with double the precision, but the accumulator carry circuit timing prevented the wiring of three or more for even higher precision. ENIAC used four of the accumulators (controlled by a special multiplier unit) to perform up to 385 multiplication operations per second; five of the accumulators were controlled by a special divider/square-rooter unit to perform up to 40 division operations per second or three square root operations per second.
The other nine units in ENIAC were the initiating unit (started and stopped the machine), the cycling unit (used for synchronizing the other units), the master programmer (controlled loop sequencing), the reader (controlled an IBM punch-card reader), the printer (controlled an IBM card punch), the constant transmitter, and three function tables.[32][33]

Operation times[edit]
The references by Rojas and Hashagen (or Wilkes)[21] give more details about the times for operations, which differ somewhat from those stated above.
The basic machine cycle was 200 microseconds (20 cycles of the 100 kHz clock in the cycling unit), or 5,000 cycles per second for operations on the 10-digit numbers. In one of these cycles, ENIAC could write a number to a register, read a number from a register, or add/subtract two numbers.
A multiplication of a 10-digit number by a d-digit number (for d up to 10) took d+4 cycles, so the multiplication of a 10-digit number by 10-digit number took 14 cycles, or 2,800 microseconds—a rate of 357 per second. If one of the numbers had fewer than 10 digits, the operation was faster.
Division and square roots took 13(d+1) cycles, where d is the number of digits in the result (quotient or square root). So a division or square root took up to 143 cycles, or 28,600 microseconds—a rate of 35 per second. (Wilkes 1956:20[21] states that a division with a 10-digit quotient required 6 milliseconds.) If the result had fewer than ten digits, it was obtained faster.
ENIAC was able to process about 500 FLOPS,[34] compared to modern supercomputers' petascale and exascale computing power.

Reliability[edit]
ENIAC used common octal-base radio tubes of the day; the decimal accumulators were made of 6SN7 flip-flops, while 6L7s, 6SJ7s, 6SA7s and 6AC7s were used in logic functions.[35] Numerous 6L6s and 6V6s served as line drivers to drive pulses through cables between rack assemblies.
Several tubes burned out almost every day, leaving ENIAC nonfunctional about half the time. Special high-reliability tubes were not available until 1948. Most of these failures, however, occurred during the warm-up and cool-down periods, when the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most thermal stress. Engineers reduced ENIAC's tube failures to the more acceptable rate of one tube every two days. According to an interview in 1989 with Eckert, ""We had a tube fail about every two days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes.""[36]
In 1954, the longest continuous period of operation without a failure was 116 hours—close to five days.

Programming[edit]
ENIAC could be programmed to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored-program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which originally had programs set up into the machine[37] by a combination of plugboard wiring and three portable function tables (containing 1,200 ten-way switches each).[38] The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due to the complexity of mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program.[39] After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.[40][41][42]
ENIAC's six primary programmers, Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman, not only determined how to input ENIAC programs, but also developed an understanding of ENIAC's inner workings.[43][44] The programmers were often able to narrow bugs down to an individual failed tube which could be pointed to for replacement by a technician.[45]

The ENIAC Programmers (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith)


Problems playing this file? See media help.

During World War II, while the U.S. Army needed to compute ballistics trajectories, many women were interviewed for this task. At least 200 women were hired by the Moore School of Engineering to work as ""computers""[23] and six of them were chosen to be the programmers of ENIAC. Betty Holberton, Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman, Betty Jean Jennings, and Fran Bilas, programmed the ENIAC to perform calculations for ballistics trajectories electronically for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory.[46] While men having the same education and experience were designated as ""professionals"", these women were unreasonably designated as ""subprofessionals"", though they had professional degrees in mathematics, and were highly trained mathematicians.[46]
These women were not ""refrigerator ladies"", i.e., models posing in front of the machine for press photography, as then computer scientist undergrad Kathryn Kleiman discovered in her own research as opposed to what she was told by a historian in computing.[47] However, some of the women did not receive recognition for their work on the ENIAC in their entire lifetimes.[23] After the war ended, the women continued to work on the ENIAC. Their expertise made their positions difficult to replace with returning soldiers.[48] Later in the 1990s, Kleiman learned that most of the ENIAC programmers were not invited to the ENIAC’s 50th anniversary event. So she made it her mission to track them down and record their oral histories. The documentary, intended to inspire young women and men to get involved in programming. ""They were shocked to be discovered,"" Kleiman says. ""They were thrilled to be recognized, but had mixed impressions about how they felt about being ignored for so long.""[47] Kleiman released a book on the six female ENIAC programmers in 2022.[49]
These early programmers were drawn from a group of about two hundred women employed as computers at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. The job of computers was to produce the numeric result of mathematical formulas needed for a scientific study, or an engineering project. They usually did so with a mechanical calculator. The women studied the machine's logic, physical structure, operation, and circuitry in order to not only understand the mathematics of computing, but also the machine itself.[23] This was one of the few technical job categories available to women at that time.[50] Betty Holberton (née Snyder) continued on to help write the first generative programming system (SORT/MERGE) and help design the first commercial electronic computers, the UNIVAC and the BINAC, alongside Jean Jennings.[51] McNulty developed the use of subroutines in order to help increase ENIAC's computational capability.[52]
Herman Goldstine selected the programmers, whom he called operators, from the computers who had been calculating ballistics tables with mechanical desk calculators, and a differential analyzer prior to and during the development of ENIAC.[23] Under Herman and Adele Goldstine's direction, the computers studied ENIAC's blueprints and physical structure to determine how to manipulate its switches and cables, as programming languages did not yet exist. Though contemporaries considered programming a clerical task and did not publicly recognize the programmers' effect on the successful operation and announcement of ENIAC,[23] McNulty, Jennings, Snyder, Wescoff, Bilas, and Lichterman have since been recognized for their contributions to computing.[53][54][55] Three of the current (2020) Army supercomputers Jean, Kay, and Betty are named after Jean Bartik (Betty Jennings), Kay McNulty, and Betty Snyder respectively.[56]
The ""programmer"" and ""operator"" job titles were not originally considered professions suitable for women. The labor shortage created by World War II helped enable the entry of women into the field.[23] However, the field was not viewed as prestigious, and bringing in women was viewed as a way to free men up for more skilled labor. Essentially, women were seen as meeting a need in a temporary crisis.[23] For example, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics said in 1942, ""It is felt that enough greater return is obtained by freeing the engineers from calculating detail to overcome any increased expenses in the computers' salaries. The engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they would. This is due in large measure to the feeling among the engineers that their college and industrial experience is being wasted and thwarted by mere repetitive calculation.""[23]
Following the initial six programmers, an expanded team of a hundred scientists was recruited to continue work on the ENIAC. Among these were several women, including Gloria Ruth Gordon.[57] Adele Goldstine wrote the original technical description of the ENIAC.[58]

Several language systems were developed to describe programs for the ENIAC, including:

Role in the hydrogen bomb[edit]
Although the Ballistic Research Laboratory was the sponsor of ENIAC, one year into this three-year project John von Neumann, a mathematician working on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos National Laboratory, became aware of the ENIAC.[61] In December 1945, the ENIAC was used to calculate thermonuclear reactions using equations. The data was used to support research on building a hydrogen bomb.[62][63]

Role in development of the Monte Carlo methods[edit]
See also: History of Monte Carlo method
Related to ENIAC's role in the hydrogen bomb was its role in the Monte Carlo method becoming popular. Scientists involved in the original nuclear bomb development used massive groups of people doing huge numbers of calculations (""computers"" in the terminology of the time) to investigate the distance that neutrons would likely travel through various materials. John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam realized the speed of ENIAC would allow these calculations to be done much more quickly.[64] The success of this project showed the value of Monte Carlo methods in science.[65]

Later developments[edit]
A press conference was held on February 1, 1946,[23] and the completed machine was announced to the public the evening of February 14, 1946,[66] featuring demonstrations of its capabilities. Elizabeth Snyder and Betty Jean Jennings were responsible for developing the demonstration trajectory program, although Herman and Adele Goldstine took credit for it.[23] The machine was formally dedicated the next day[67] at the University of Pennsylvania. None of the women involved in programming the machine or creating the demonstration were invited to the formal dedication nor to the celebratory dinner held afterwards.[68]
The original contract amount was $61,700; the final cost was almost $500,000 (approximately equivalent to $9,000,000 in 2023). It was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. ENIAC was shut down on November 9, 1946, for a refurbishment and a memory upgrade, and was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in 1947. There, on July 29, 1947, it was turned on and was in continuous operation until 11:45 p.m. on October 2, 1955, when it was retired in favor of the more efficient EDVAC and ORDVAC computers.[2]

Role in the development of the EDVAC[edit]
A few months after ENIAC's unveiling in the summer of 1946, as part of ""an extraordinary effort to jump-start research in the field"",[69] the Pentagon invited ""the top people in electronics and mathematics from the United States and Great Britain""[69] to a series of forty-eight lectures given in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; all together called The Theory and Techniques for Design of Digital Computers—more often named the Moore School Lectures.[69] Half of these lectures were given by the inventors of ENIAC.[70]
ENIAC was a one-of-a-kind design and was never repeated. The freeze on design in 1943 meant that it lacked some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the EDVAC, which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a memory unit (the mercury delay line) which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC) which were intended to be used as an internal memorandum—describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer Herman Goldstine distributed copies of this First Draft to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in the construction of a new generation of electronic computing machines, including Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and SEAC at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.[71]

Improvements[edit]
A number of improvements were made to ENIAC after 1947, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the function tables as program ROM,[71][72][73][74][75][76] after which programming was done by setting the switches.[77] The idea has been worked out in several variants by Richard Clippinger and his group, on the one hand, and the Goldstines, on the other,[78] and it was included in the ENIAC patent.[79] Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on what instruction set to implement.[71][80][81] Clippinger had thought of a three-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a one-address architecture because it was simpler to implement. Three digits of one accumulator (#6) were used as the program counter, another accumulator (#15) was used as the main accumulator, a third accumulator (#8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the function tables, and most of the other accumulators (1–5, 7, 9–14, 17–19) were used for data memory.
In March 1948 the converter unit was installed,[82] which made possible programming through the reader from standard IBM cards.[83][84] The ""first production run"" of the new coding techniques on the Monte Carlo problem followed in April.[82][85] After ENIAC's move to Aberdeen, a register panel for memory was also constructed, but it did not work. A small master control unit to turn the machine on and off was also added.[86]
The programming of the stored program for ENIAC was done by Betty Jennings, Clippinger, Adele Goldstine and others.[87][88][72][71] It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer in April 1948,[89] running a program by Adele Goldstine for John von Neumann. This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC by a factor of 6 and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time[81][71] to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely I/O bound, even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.
Early in 1952, a high-speed shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting by a factor of five. In July 1953, a 100-word expansion core memory was added to the system, using binary-coded decimal, excess-3 number representation. To support this expansion memory, ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a memory address selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.[71]

Comparison with other early computers[edit]
Main article: History of computing hardware
Pennsylvania state historical marker on the University of Pennsylvania's campus in Philadelphia
Mechanical computing machines have been around since Archimedes' time (see: Antikythera mechanism), but the 1930s and 1940s are considered the beginning of the modern computer era.
ENIAC was, like the IBM Harvard Mark I and the German Z3, able to run an arbitrary sequence of mathematical operations, but did not read them from a tape. Like the British Colossus, it was programmed by plugboard and switches. ENIAC combined full, Turing-complete programmability with electronic speed. The Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC), ENIAC, and Colossus all used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus.
Like the Colossus, ENIAC required rewiring to reprogram until April 1948.[90] In June 1948, the Manchester Baby ran its first program and earned the distinction of first electronic stored-program computer.[91][92][93] Though the idea of a stored-program computer with combined memory for program and data was conceived during the development of ENIAC, it was not initially implemented in ENIAC because World War II priorities required the machine to be completed quickly, and ENIAC's 20 storage locations would be too small to hold data and programs.

Public knowledge[edit]
The Z3 and Colossus were developed independently of each other, and of the ABC and ENIAC during World War II. Work on the ABC at Iowa State University was stopped in 1942 after John Atanasoff was called to Washington, D.C., to do physics research for the U.S. Navy, and it was subsequently dismantled.[94] The Z3 was destroyed by the Allied bombing raids of Berlin in 1943. As the ten Colossus machines were part of the UK's war effort their existence remained secret until the late 1970s, although knowledge of their capabilities remained among their UK staff and invited Americans. ENIAC, by contrast, was put through its paces for the press in 1946, ""and captured the world's imagination"". Older histories of computing may therefore not be comprehensive in their coverage and analysis of this period. All but two of the Colossus machines were dismantled in 1945; the remaining two were used to decrypt Soviet messages by GCHQ until the 1960s.[95][96] The public demonstration for ENIAC was developed by Snyder and Jennings who created a demo that would calculate the trajectory of a missile in 15 seconds, a task that would have taken several weeks for a human computer.[52]

Patent[edit]
Main article: Honeywell v. Sperry Rand
For a variety of reasons – including Mauchly's June 1941 examination of the Atanasoff–Berry computer (ABC), prototyped in 1939 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry – U.S. patent 3,120,606 for ENIAC, applied for in 1947 and granted in 1964, was voided by the 1973[97] decision of the landmark federal court case Honeywell, Inc. v. Sperry Rand Corp.. The decision included: that the ENIAC inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from Atanasoff;  gave legal recognition to Atanasoff as the inventor of the first electronic digital computer; and put the invention of the electronic digital computer in the public domain.

Pieces of ENIAC are held by the following institutions:

The School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania has four of the original forty panels (Accumulator #18, Constant Transmitter Panel 2, Master Programmer Panel 2, and the Cycling Unit) and one of the three function tables (Function Table B) of ENIAC (on loan from the Smithsonian).[98]
The Smithsonian has five panels (Accumulators 2, 19, and 20; Constant Transmitter panels 1 and 3; Divider and Square Rooter; Function Table 2 panel 1; Function Table 3 panel 2; High-speed Multiplier panels 1 and 2; Printer panel 1; Initiating Unit)[98] in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[23] (but apparently not currently on display).
The Science Museum in London has a receiver unit on display.
The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California has three panels (Accumulator #12, Function Table 2 panel 2, and Printer Panel 3) and portable function table C on display (on loan from the Smithsonian Institution).[98]
The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor has four panels (two accumulators, High-speed Multiplier panel 3, and Master Programmer panel 2),[98] salvaged by Arthur Burks.[99]
The United States Army Ordnance Museum at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, where ENIAC was used, has Portable Function Table A.
The U.S. Army Field Artillery Museum in Fort Sill, as of October 2014, obtained seven panels of ENIAC that were previously housed by The Perot Group in Plano, Texas.[100] There are accumulators #7, #8, #11, and #17;[101] panel #1 and #2 that connected to function table #1,[98] and the back of a panel showing its tubes. A module of tubes is also on display.
The United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, has one of the data entry terminals from the ENIAC.
The Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Paderborn, Germany, has three panels (Printer panel 2 and High-speed Function Table)[98] (on loan from the Smithsonian Institution). In 2014 the museum decided to rebuild one of the accumulator panels – reconstructed part has the look and feel of a simplified counterpart from the original machine.[102][103]
Recognition[edit]
ENIAC was named an IEEE Milestone in 1987.[104]

ENIAC on a Chip, University of Pennsylvania (1995) - Computer History Museum
In 1996, in honor of the ENIAC's 50th anniversary, The University of Pennsylvania sponsored a project named ""ENIAC-on-a-Chip"", where a very small silicon computer chip measuring 7.44 mm by 5.29 mm was built with the same functionality as ENIAC. Although this 20 MHz chip was many times faster than ENIAC, it had but a fraction of the speed of its contemporary microprocessors in the late 1990s.[105][106][107]
In 1997, the six women who did most of the programming of ENIAC were inducted into the Technology International Hall of Fame.[53][108] The role of the ENIAC programmers is treated in a 2010 documentary film titled Top Secret Rosies: The Female ""Computers"" of WWII by LeAnn Erickson.[54] A 2014 documentary short, The Computers by Kate McMahon, tells of the story of the six programmers; this was the result of 20 years' research by Kathryn Kleiman and her team as part of the ENIAC Programmers Project.[55][109] In 2022 Grand Central Publishing released Proving Ground by Kathy Kleiman, a hardcover biography about the six ENIAC programmers and their efforts to translate block diagrams and electronic schematics of the ENIAC, then under construction, into programs that would be loaded into and run on ENIAC once it was available for use.[110]
In 2011, in honor of the 65th anniversary of the ENIAC's unveiling, the city of Philadelphia declared February 15 as ENIAC Day.[111][112][113]
The ENIAC celebrated its 70th anniversary on February 15, 2016.[114]

"
What is the Stuxnet worm?,"Stuxnet is a computer worm that was first discovered in 2010. It was designed to infect industrial control systems (ICS) that are used in manufacturing facilities. Stuxnet was created by a group of researchers at the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the US Central Command (CENTCOM). The worm was designed to target control systems that are used in the operation of industrial machinery, such as centrifuges and turbines.

Stuxnet was able to infect its target systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in the control systems' operating system. Once infected, the worm would then use its built-in malware to take control of the system's operations. Stuxnet was designed to cause damage to the targeted machinery by disrupting its normal operations. The worm would cause the machinery to malfunction, leading to decreased production and increased costs.

Stuxnet was first detected in Iran, where it was believed to have been used to sabotage centrifuges used in uranium enrichment. The worm was also believed to have been used to target other industrial control systems in Iran and possibly other countries.

Stuxnet was discovered by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, who were investigating a series of unexplained industrial accidents in Iran. The worm was named after the town of Stuxnet, where it was first detected. The worm was believed to have been created by a group of researchers at the NSA and CENTCOM, who were working on behalf of the US government.

Stuxnet was believed to have been created as part of a larger program to disrupt the operation of Iranian nuclear facilities. The worm was believed to have been used to target the centrifuges used in uranium enrichment, which are critical to the nuclear weapons program. The worm was believed to have been used to disrupt the centrifuges' operation, causing them to overheat and malfunction.

Stuxnet was believed to have been used in a number of countries, including Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. The worm was believed to have been used to target industrial control systems in these countries, causing damage to the targeted machinery. Stuxnet was believed to have been used in a number of industrial accidents, including the 2011 explosion at the Esfahan uranium enrichment facility in Iran.

What is the Cat's Eye Nebula?,"The Cat's Eye Nebula, also known as NGC 6540, is a planetary nebula located in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered by the astronomer William Herschel in 1787.

The nebula is shaped like a cat's eye and is about 50 light-years across. It is a remnant of a dying star, and it is believed to have formed from the outer layers of a star that had exhausted its nuclear fuel.

The nebula is named after its resemblance to a cat's eye, which is a gemstone that is cut to resemble a cat's eye. The name is also sometimes spelled as ""Cat's Eye Nebula.""

The Cat's Eye Nebula is visible to the naked eye, but it is best viewed with a telescope. It is also visible in photographs and is one of the most famous planetary nebulae in the sky.

The nebula is located in a region of space known as the Cygnus Arms, which is a region of space that is rich in stars and other astronomical objects. It is also located in the Cygnus Loop, which is a supernova remnant that is visible in the night sky.

The discovery of the Cat's Eye Nebula was significant because it was one of the first planetary nebulae to be observed and studied in detail. It has since become one of the most well-known and studied objects in the sky, and it has provided scientists with valuable information about the processes that occur during the final stages of a star's life.",False,https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/3882-Image?keyword=NGC%205189,"

Caption

                                Though the Cat's Eye Nebula was one of the first planetary nebulae to be discovered, it is one of the most complex such nebulae ever seen. Planetary nebulae form when Sun-like stars gently eject their outer gaseous layers, creating amazing and confounding shapes. The Cat's Eye Nebula, also known as NGC 6543, is a visual ""fossil record"" of the dynamics and late evolution of a dying star. It is estimated to be 1,000 years old.In 1994, initial Hubble observations revealed the nebula's surprisingly intricate structures, including gas shells, jets of high-speed gas, and unusual shock-induced knots of gas. Subsequent Hubble images showed a bull's-eye pattern of eleven or more concentric rings, or shells, of dust around the Cat's Eye. Each ""ring"" is actually the edge of a spherical bubble seen projected onto the sky — that's why it appears bright along its outer edge.Observations suggest the star that created the Cat's Eye Nebula ejected its mass in a series of pulses at 1,500-year intervals. These convulsions created dust shells, each of which contains as much mass as all of the planets in our solar system combined (still only one percent of the Sun's mass). These concentric shells make a layered, onion-skin structure around the dying star. The view from Hubble is like seeing an onion cut in half, where each skin layer is discernible.Approximately 1,000 years ago the pattern of mass loss suddenly changed, and the Cat's Eye Nebula began forming inside the dusty shells. It has been expanding ever since, as discernible in comparing Hubble images taken in 1994, 1997, 2000, and 2002. But what caused this dramatic change? Many aspects of the process that leads a star to lose its gaseous envelope are still poorly understood, and the study of planetary nebulae is one of the few ways to recover information about these last few thousand years in the life of a Sun-like star.Until recently, it was thought that shells around planetary nebulae were a rare phenomenon. However, Romano Corradi of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes in Spain and his collaborators instead used Hubble to show that the formation of these rings is likely to be the rule rather than the exception. In 2013, Martin A. Guerrero, of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia in Spain, used Hubble to study the temperature and density of the Cat's Eye Nebula's shells. He found that the shells represent a series of shocks propagating into pre-existing lower density material.Several explanations have been proposed for the bull's-eye patterns seen around planetary nebulae, including cycles of magnetic activity somewhat similar to our own Sun's sunspot cycle, the action of a companion star orbiting around the dying star, and stellar pulsations. Another school of thought is that the material is ejected smoothly from the star, and the rings are created later on due to the formation of waves in the outflowing material. Further observations and more theoretical studies are needed to decide between these and other possible explanations.Constellation: DracoDistance: 3,000 light-years (1,000 parsecs)Instrument: Advanced Camera for Surveys/WFCImage Filters: F502N [O III], FR505N [O III], F658N (H-alpha+[N II])

"
What is the Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus?,"Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is a virus that is spread to humans and animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a rare but serious viral infection that can cause flu-like symptoms, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and in some cases, death.

In the United States, EEE has been reported in several states, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. The virus is most commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Southeast and Northeast regions.

Here are some specific details and examples of EEE outbreaks in the United States:

* In 2004, there was an outbreak of EEE in New York, where 10 people were infected and two died. The virus was first detected in a mosquito in Queens County, and then spread to humans in the Bronx and Brooklyn.
* In 2014, there was an outbreak of EEE in Maryland, where 21 people were infected and one person died. The virus was first detected in mosquitoes in Prince George's County, and then spread to humans in Montgomery County.
* In 2015, there was an outbreak of EEE in Pennsylvania, where 12 people were infected and one person died. The virus was first detected in mosquitoes in Bucks County, and then spread to humans in Allegheny County.
* In 2018, there was an outbreak of EEE in Virginia, where 10 people were infected and one person died. The virus was first detected in mosquitoes in Fairfax County, and then spread to humans in Prince William County.

It is important to note that while EEE is not a common virus in the United States, it is a serious viral infection that can cause severe illness and even death. It is important to take precautions to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites, and to seek medical attention if you experience symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches.",False,https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/about/index.html,"

"
What is Project MKUltra?,"Project MKUltra was a top-secret CIA program that ran from 1951 to 1973. The program's primary goal was to develop and test mind-altering drugs, particularly those that could be used to control and manipulate human behavior. The program was named after the mythical figure, ""Dr. MKUltra,"" who was the fictional head of the program.

The program was run by the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI), which was responsible for investigating and developing new technologies. The OSI's primary focus was on developing new forms of mind-altering drugs, including LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide), a powerful hallucinogen that has been used in Project MKUltra.

Project MKUltra was carried out at several locations, including the CIA's secret CIA laboratories in Maryland, and at various medical research facilities around the country, such as the University of California at San Diego, the University of Maryland, and the National Institute of Mental Health.

The program involved the use of military personnel and civilians who were given experimental drugs to study their effects on human behavior. The CIA recruited volunteers from military bases, universities, and other sources, and some of the participants were subjected to prolonged experimentation, including forced administration of the drugs.

The program was funded by the CIA's budget, and the agency worked closely with other government agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Defense to conduct the research. The program was also closely monitored by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which was responsible for the military aspects of the program.

The results of the program were kept secret from the public and the participants, and the program was not disclosed until the 1970s when the details of the program were declassified. The program was considered to be one of the most controversial and unethical programs in the history of intelligence gathering and it has been criticized for its use of secret methods, its lack of informed consent, and its disregard for the well-being of the participants.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra,"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


CIA program involving illegal experimentation on human test subjects (1953–1973)
""MKULTRA"" redirects here. For other uses, see MKULTRA (disambiguation).
Not to be confused with Edgewood Arsenal human experiments.


Declassified MKUltra documents
Project MKUltra[a] was a human experimentation program designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used during interrogations to weaken individuals and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture.[1] The term MKUltra is a CIA cryptonym: ""MK"" is an arbitrary prefix standing for the Office of Technical Service and ""Ultra"" is an arbitrary word out of a dictionary to denominate this project. The program has been widely condemned as a violation of individual rights and an example of the CIA’s abuse of power, with critics highlighting its disregard for consent and its corrosive impact on democratic principles.[2]
Project MKUltra began in 1953 and was halted in 1973. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions, such as the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals without the subjects' consent. Additionally, other methods beyond chemical compounds were used, including electroshocks,[3] hypnosis,[4][5] sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, and other forms of torture.[6][7]
Project MKUltra was preceded by Project Artichoke.[8][9] It was organized through the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories.[10] The program engaged in illegal activities,[11][12][13] including the use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as unwitting test subjects.[11]: 74 [14][15][16] MKUltra's scope was broad, with activities carried out under the guise of research at more than 80 institutions aside from the military, including colleges and universities, hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies.[17] The CIA operated using front organizations, although some top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.[11]
Project MKUltra was revealed to the public in 1975 by the Church Committee (named after Senator Frank Church) of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States (the Rockefeller Commission). Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms's order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the small number of documents that survived Helms's order.[18] In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings.[11][19] Some surviving information about MKUltra was declassified in 2001.


Background[edit]
Origin of the project[edit]
During the early 1940s, Nazi scientists working in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau during World War II conducted interrogation experiments on human subjects. Substances such as barbiturates, morphine derivatives, and hallucinogens such as mescaline were employed in experiments conducted on Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Jewish, and other nationalities' prisoners of war.[20] The aim of these experiments was to develop a truth serum which would, in the words of one laboratory assistant to Dachau scientist Kurt Plötner, ""eliminate the will of the person examined"".[20] American historian Stephen Kinzer said that the CIA project was a continuation of these earlier Nazi experiments, as evidenced by MKUltra's use of mescaline on unwitting subjects, which had previously been done by Nazi scientists in Dachau.[21]
American interest in drug-related interrogation experiments began in 1943, when the Office of Strategic Services began developing a ""truth drug"" that would produce ""uninhibited truthfulness"" in an interrogated person.[22][23] In 1947, the United States Navy initiated Project CHATTER, an interrogation program which saw the first testing of LSD on human subjects.[24][25]
In 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency under the direction of general Walter Bedell Smith initiated a series of interrogation projects involving human subjects, beginning with the launch of Project Bluebird, officially renamed Project Artichoke on August 20, 1951.[26] Directed and overseen by Brigadier General Paul F. Gaynor, the objective of Artichoke was to determine whether an individual could be made to involuntarily perform an act of attempted assassination.[27] Morphine, mescaline and LSD were all administered on unknowing CIA agents in an attempt to produce amnesia in the subjects. In addition, Project Artichoke aimed to employ certain viruses such as dengue fever as potential incapacitating agents.[28]

Aims and leadership[edit]
Sidney Gottlieb approved of an MKUltra sub-project on LSD in this June 9, 1953, letter.
The project was headed by Sidney Gottlieb but began on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953.[29][30] Its aim was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war during the Korean War.[31] The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives, and was interested in manipulating foreign leaders with such techniques,[32] devising several schemes to drug Fidel Castro. It often conducted experiments without the subjects' knowledge or consent.[33] In some cases, academic researchers were funded through grants from CIA front organizations but were unaware that the CIA was using their work for these purposes.
The project attempted to produce a perfect truth serum for interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War and to explore other possibilities of mind control. Subproject 54 was the Navy's top-secret ""Perfect Concussion"" program, which was supposed to use sub-aural frequency blasts to erase memory; the program was never carried out.[34]
Most MKUltra records were destroyed in 1973 by order of CIA director Richard Helms, so it has been difficult for investigators to gain a complete understanding of the more than 150 funded research subprojects sponsored by MKUltra and related CIA programs.[35]
The project began during a period of what English journalist Rupert Cornwell described as ""paranoia"" at the CIA, when the U.S. had lost its nuclear monopoly and fear of communism was at its height.[36] CIA counter-intelligence chief James Jesus Angleton believed that a mole had penetrated the organization at the highest levels.[36] The agency poured millions of dollars into studies examining ways to influence and control the mind and enhance its ability to extract information from resistant subjects during interrogation.[37][38] Some historians assert that one goal of MKUltra and related CIA projects was to create a Manchurian Candidate-style subject.[39] American historian Alfred W. McCoy has claimed that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of ""ridiculous"" programs so that the public would not look at the research's primary goal, which was effective methods of interrogation.[37]

Applications[edit]
The 1976 Church Committee report found that, in the MKDELTA program, ""Drugs were used primarily as an aid to interrogations, but MKULTRA/MKDELTA materials were also used for harassment, discrediting or disabling purposes.""[40][41][42]

In 1964, MKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA program. The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN and MKCHICKWIT. Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971.[43] The project was a joint project between the U.S. Army Chemical Corps and the CIA's Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents, with a focus on incapacitating agents. Its purpose was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques of producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements.[43]
By March 1971, over 26,000 potential agents had been acquired for future screening.[44] The CIA was interested in bird migration patterns for chemical and biological warfare (CBW) research; subproject 139 designated ""Bird Disease Studies"" at Pennsylvania State University.[45] MKOFTEN was to deal with testing and toxicological transmissivity and behavioral effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans.[43] MKCHICKWIT was concerned with acquiring information on new drug developments in Europe and Asia, and with acquiring samples.[43]
In January 1957, the CIA started a subproject of MKUltra in effort to broaden their scientific research. ""Subproject 68"", conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal under the direction of psychiatrist Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, represents one of the most infamous and ethically controversial endeavors within the MKUltra program.[46] This subproject aimed to explore innovative techniques for manipulating and controlling human behavior, particularly through the methods of ""psychic driving"" and ""depatterning"". Psychic driving involved subjecting patients to continuous playback of recorded messages, often with themes of self-improvement or identity reinforcement, while they were under the influence of powerful psychoactive substances such as LSD or barbiturates.[47]

Experiments on Americans[edit]
CIA documents suggest that they investigated ""chemical, biological, and radiological"" methods of mind control as part of MKUltra.[48] They spent an estimated $10 million or more, roughly $87.5 million adjusted for inflation.[49]
During a hearing by the Senate Health Subcommittee, a testimony by the Deputy Director of the CIA stated that over 30 institutions and universities were involved in the experimentation program of testing drugs on unknowing citizens ""at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign."" Several of these tests involved the issuing of LSD to unaware subjects in social situations.[1]
The Army was subject to the testing of LSD which occurred in three phases. The first phase included over 1,000 American soldiers who willingly volunteered for testing of chemical warfare experiments. Phase two had 96 volunteers who were induced with LSD in evaluation of the possibility of intelligence uses of the drug. The third phase included Projects THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT which conducted experiments on 16 unwitting nonvolunteer subjects that after receiving LSD were interrogated as a part of operation field tests.[1]
After retiring in 1972, Gottlieb dismissed his entire effort for the CIA's MKUltra program as useless.[36][50] Files discovered in 1977 containing 700 pages of new information showed that experiments had continued until Gottlieb ordered the program halted on July 10, 1972.[51]

LSD[edit]
In 1938, LSD was created by Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. The early directors of MKUltra became aware of the existence of LSD and sought to use it for ""mind-control"". In the early 1950s, MKUltra director Sidney Gottlieb arranged for the CIA to buy the entire supply of LSD for $240,000, which in 2024, would be $4,227,079.[52] This LSD supply gave Gottlieb the ability to fulfill his experiment by spreading LSD to prisons, hospitals, institutions, clinics, and foundations in order to see how citizens would react to the drug without knowing exactly what was happening to them.
Early CIA efforts focused on LSD-25, which later came to dominate many of MKUltra's programs.[53] The CIA wanted to know if they could make Soviet spies defect against their will and whether the Soviets could do the same to the CIA's own operatives.[54]
Documents obtained from the CIA by John D. Marks under Freedom of Information in 1976 showed that, in 1953, the CIA considered purchasing 10 kilograms of LSD, enough for 100 million doses. The proposed purchase aimed to stop other countries from controlling the supply. The documents showed that the CIA purchased some quantities of LSD from Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland.[55]
Once Project MKUltra started, in April 1953, experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts, and prostitutes – ""people who could not fight back"", as one agency officer put it.[56] In one case, they administered LSD to a mental patient in Kentucky for 174 days.[56] They also administered LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, and members of the general public to study their reactions. The aim was to find drugs that would bring out deep confessions or wipe a subject's mind clean and program them as ""a robot agent"".[57] Military personnel who received the mind-altering drugs were also threatened with courts-martial if they told anyone about the experiments.[58] LSD and other drugs were often administered without the subject's knowledge or informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code the U.S. had agreed to follow after World War II. Many veterans who were subjected to experimentation are now seeking legal and monetary reparations.[58]
In Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels within agency safehouses in San Francisco to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with one-way mirrors, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study.[59] In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. They told subjects they would extend their ""trips"" if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people under this interrogation were CIA employees, U.S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this.[57] Heroin addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.[11][60]
At the invitation of Stanford psychology graduate student Vik Lovell, an acquaintance of Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey volunteered to take part in what turned out to be a CIA-financed study under the aegis of MKUltra,[61] at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital[62][63] where he worked as a night aide.[64] The project studied the effects of psychoactive drugs, particularly LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, AMT and DMT on people.[65]
The Office of Security used LSD in interrogations, but Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who directed MKUltra, had other ideas: he thought it could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he believed it could be given to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches, etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in ""normal"" settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point arrived where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often occurred, such as an operative who received the drug in his morning coffee, became psychotic and ran across Washington, D.C., seeing a monster in every car passing him. The experiments continued even after Frank Olson, an army chemist who had never taken LSD, was covertly dosed by his CIA supervisor and nine days later plunged to his death from the window of a 13th-story New York City hotel room, supposedly as a result of deep depression induced by the drug.[66] According to Stephen Kinzer, Olson had approached his superiors some time earlier, doubting the morality of the project, and asked to resign from the CIA.[67]
Some subjects' participation was consensual, and in these cases they appeared to be singled out for even more extreme experiments. In one case, seven drug-addicted African-American participants at the National Institute of Mental Health Addiction Research Center in Kentucky were given LSD for 77 consecutive days.[68][69]
MKUltra's researchers later dismissed LSD as too unpredictable in its results.[70] They gave up on the notion that LSD was ""the secret that was going to unlock the universe"", but it still had a place in the cloak-and-dagger arsenal. However, by 1962, the CIA and the army developed a series of super-hallucinogens such as the highly touted BZ, which was thought to hold greater promise as a mind control weapon. This resulted in the withdrawal of support by many academics and private researchers, and LSD research became less of a priority altogether.[66]

Other drugs[edit]
Another technique investigated was the intravenous administration of a barbiturate into one arm and an amphetamine into the other.[71] The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released.
Other experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, alcohol and sodium pentothal.[72]

Hypnosis[edit]
Declassified MKUltra documents indicate they studied hypnosis in the early 1950s. Experimental goals included creating ""hypnotically induced anxieties"", ""hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter"", studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations, ""hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects"", and studying ""relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis"".[73] They conducted experiments with drug-induced hypnosis and with anterograde and retrograde amnesia while under the influence of such drugs.

Experiments on Canadians[edit]
Donald Ewen Cameron, c. 1967
The CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the ""psychic driving"" concept, which the CIA found interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University, and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 (US$766,936 in 2024, adjusted for inflation) to carry out MKUltra experiments there. The Montreal experiments research funds were sent to Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from the CIA.[74]: 141–142 
In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His ""driving"" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were often carried out on patients who entered the institute for common problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanent effects from his actions.[74]: 140–150  His treatments resulted in victims' urinary incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents and thinking their interrogators were their parents.[75]
During this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of both the American Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Psychiatric Association. Cameron was also a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946–1947.[74]: 141 

Motivation and assessments[edit]
His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Sutton, who was also involved in the Secret Intelligence Service and who experimented on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.[76]
In the 1980s, several of Cameron's former patients sued the CIA for damages, which the Canadian news program The Fifth Estate documented.[77] Their experiences and lawsuit were adapted in the 1998 television miniseries The Sleep Room.[78]
Naomi Klein argues in her book The Shock Doctrine that Cameron's research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing ""a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources'. In other words, torture.""[79]
Alfred W. McCoy writes, ""Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Dr. Cameron's experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb's earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method"",[80] referring to first creating a state of disorientation in the subject, and then creating a situation of ""self-inflicted"" discomfort in which the disoriented subject can alleviate pain by capitulating.[80]

Secret detention camps[edit]
In areas under American control in the early 1950s in Europe and East Asia, mostly Japan, West Germany and the Philippines, the CIA created secret detention centers (black sites) so that the U.S. could avoid criminal prosecution. The CIA captured people suspected of being enemy agents and other people it deemed ""expendable"" to undertake various types of torture and human experimentation on them. The prisoners were interrogated while being administered psychoactive drugs, electroshocked and subjected to extremes of temperature, sensory isolation and the like to develop a better understanding of how to destroy and to control human minds.[3]

Revelation[edit]
In 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by the Watergate scandal, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed.[81] Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms's purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a FOIA request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977.[11]

Frank Church headed the Church Committee, an investigation into the practices of the U.S. intelligence agencies.
In December 1974, The New York Times alleged that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s.[82] That report prompted investigations by the United States Congress, in the form of the Church Committee, and by a commission known as the Rockefeller Commission that looked into the illegal domestic activities of the CIA, the FBI and intelligence-related agencies of the military.
In the summer of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential Rockefeller Commission report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, Frank Olson, had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973.[83] However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously and had headed MKUltra, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.[17]
The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator Frank Church, concluded that ""prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects."" The committee noted that the ""experiments sponsored by these researchers [...] call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments.""
Following the recommendations of the Church Committee, President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited ""experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject"" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.

1977 United States Senate report on MKUltra
In 1977, during a hearing held by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to look further into MKUltra, Admiral Stansfield Turner, then Director of Central Intelligence, revealed that the CIA had found a set of records, consisting of about 20,000 pages,[84] that had survived the 1973 destruction orders because they had been incorrectly stored at a records center not usually used for such documents.[83] These files dealt with the financing of MKUltra projects and contained few project details, but much more was learned from them than from the Inspector General's 1963 report.
On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy said:

The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an ""extensive testing and experimentation"" program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens ""at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign."" Several of these tests involved the administration of LSD to ""unwitting subjects in social situations.""[85]
At least one death, the result of the alleged defenestration of Frank Olson, was attributed to Olson's being subjected, without his knowledge, to such experimentation nine days before his death.[citation needed] The CIA itself subsequently acknowledged that these tests had little scientific rationale. The officers conducting the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.[86][87]
In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984 on a CBC news show, The Fifth Estate. It was learned that not only had the CIA funded Cameron's efforts, but also that the Canadian government was fully aware of this, and had later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S. counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of court for $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. Cameron died on September 8, 1967, after suffering a heart attack while he and his son were mountain climbing. None of Cameron's personal records of his involvement with MKUltra survived because his family destroyed them after his death.[88][89]

1994 U.S. General Accounting Office report[edit]
The U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, the Department of Defense and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.
The quote from the study:[90]

Working with the CIA, the Department of Defense gave hallucinogenic drugs to thousands of ""volunteer"" soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to LSD, the Army also tested quinuclidinyl benzilate, a hallucinogen code-named BZ. (Note 37) Many of these tests were conducted under the so-called MKULTRA program, established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing techniques. Between 1953 and 1964, the program consisted of 149 projects involving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects
Death of Frank Olson[edit]


Frank Olson
Several known deaths have been associated with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. By 1951, Frank Olson was a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher.[91] In 1951 academic sources attributed the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning
incident to ergot poisoning through a local bakery (which appeared to be plausible because ergot naturally contains lysergic acid, the chemical precursor to LSD).[92][93][94]
In 1953, a few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research.
Among Olson's concerns were:

the development of assassination materials used by the CIA,
the CIA's use of biological warfare materials in covert operations,
experimentation with biological weapons in populated areas,
collaboration with former Nazi scientists under Operation Paperclip,
LSD mind control research, and
the use of psychoactive drugs during ""terminal"" interrogations under a program code-named Project Artichoke.[95]
In November of 1953, Olson was given LSD without his knowledge or consent as part of a CIA experiment, and died after falling from a 13th-story window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson fell to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.[91]
In 1975, Olson's family received a $750,000 settlement from the U.S. government and formal apologies from President Gerald Ford and CIA Director William Colby, though their apologies were limited to informed consent issues concerning Olson's ingestion of LSD.[96]
In 1977, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Committee on Human Resources wrote:

""Given the CIA's purposeful destruction of most records, its failure to follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, and the lack of follow-up data, the full impact of MKUltra experiments, including deaths, may never be known.""[35][97][90][96]
In 1994, Olson's body was exhumed and cranial injuries indicated that Olson had been knocked unconscious before he exited the window.
This means the forensic evidence conflicted with the former official version of events by the CIA.[91]
The medical examiner termed Olson's death a ""homicide"".[98]
Since 2001 (or earlier), the Olson family disputes the official version of events. They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, about many of which he had direct personal knowledge.[99]
A 2010 book alleged:

that the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning was part of MKDELTA,
that Olson was involved in that event, and
that he was eventually murdered by the CIA.[100][101]
In 2012 (November 28) the Olson family filed suit against the U.S. federal government for the wrongful death of Frank Olson.[102] In 2013 (July) the case was dismissed, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government.[103]
In the decision dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote,

""While the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family's suit], farfetched as they may sound.""[104]
Legal issues involving informed consent[edit]
The revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.
Previously, the CIA and the Army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under the Feres doctrine.
In 1987, the Supreme Court affirmed this defense in a 5–4 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: United States v. Stanley.[105] The majority argued that ""a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters."" In dissent, Justice William Brennan argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of constitutional rights:

The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects... [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials [...] began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing a separate dissent, stated:

No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential [...] to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.
In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshal, after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest.[106] While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent and that Ritchie's behavior was typical of someone on LSD, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of MKUltra's victims or that LSD caused his robbery attempt, and dismissed the case in 2005.[107][108][106]

Documented subjects[edit]
Confirmed subjects:

Allen Ginsberg first took LSD in an experiment on Stanford University's campus where he could listen to records of his choice (he chose a Gertrude Stein reading, a Tibetan mandala, and Richard Wagner). He said the experience resulted in ""a slight paranoia that hung on all my acid experiences through the mid-1960s until I learned from meditation how to disperse that.""[112] He became an outspoken advocate for psychedelics in the 1960s and, after hearing suspicions that the experiment was CIA-funded, wrote, ""Am I, Allen Ginsberg, the product of one of the CIA's lamentable, ill-advised, or triumphantly successful experiments in mind control?""[113]
Ken Kesey, author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, is said to have volunteered for MKUltra experiments involving LSD and other psychedelic drugs at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Menlo Park while he was a student at nearby Stanford University. Kesey's experiences while under the influence of LSD inspired him to promote the drug outside the context of the MKUltra experiments, which influenced the early development of hippie culture.[65][114][115]
Harold Blauer was an American tennis player who died from injections of 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine in the New York State Psychiatric Institute, which he had voluntarily checked into due to his depression following a divorce.
Robert Hunter was an American lyricist, singer-songwriter, translator, and poet, best known for his association with Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. Along with Ken Kesey, Hunter was said to be an early volunteer MKUltra test subject at Stanford University. Stanford test subjects were paid to take LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, then report on their experiences. These experiences were creatively formative for Hunter:Sit back picture yourself swooping up a shell of purple with foam crests of crystal drops soft nigh they fall unto the sea of morning creep-very-softly mist [...] and then sort of cascade tinkley-bell-like (must I take you by the hand, ever so slowly type) and then conglomerate suddenly into a peal of silver vibrant uncomprehendingly, blood singingly, joyously resounding bells [...] By my faith if this be insanity, then for the love of God permit me to remain insane.[116]
Alleged subjects:

James ""Whitey"" Bulger alleged he had been subjected to weekly injections of LSD and subsequent testing while in prison in Atlanta in 1957.[117][118]
Ted Kaczynski, an American domestic terrorist known as the Unabomber, was said to be a subject of a voluntary psychological study alleged by some sources to have been a part of MKUltra.[119][120][121] As a sophomore at Harvard, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a ""purposely brutalizing psychological experiment"", led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray.[122] In total, Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.[123]
Sirhan Sirhan's attorney, Lawrence Teeter, believed that Sirhan was ""operating under MKUltra mind control techniques"" when he assassinated Robert F. Kennedy.[124]
Charles Manson has been tied to MKULTRA by author Tom O'Neil, beginning with his time in prison, when Manson took part in drug-induced psychological experiments run by the federal government.[125] This continued through his ongoing connection to the CIA's Free Medical Clinic in San Francisco once out of prison in 1967.[citation needed]
In popular culture[edit]
MKUltra plays a part in many conspiracy theories due to its nature and the destruction of most records. This has also led to the urban legends that the human experiments performed by the CIA are ongoing into the present.[126]

Television[edit]
The 1998 CBC miniseries The Sleep Room dramatizes brainwashing experiments funded by MKUltra that were performed on Canadian mental patients in the 1950s and 60s, and their subsequent efforts to sue the CIA.[78]
In season 2, episode 5 of Fringe, ""Dream Logic"", Walter Bishop mentions his participation in MKUltra experiments, using LSD and suggestion.
In season 2, episode 19 of Bones, ""Spaceman in a Crater"", Jack Hodgins mentions that Frank Olson was an unwitting participant and committed suicide, but that an exhumation 45 years later proved he was murdered.[127]
Wormwood is a 2017 American six-part docudrama miniseries directed by Errol Morris and released on Netflix. The series is based on the life of the scientist Frank Olson and his involvement in Project MKUltra.[128]
The Netflix series Stranger Things is largely based on the MKUltra experiments and the subsequent US government cover-ups. The main character, Eleven, is a child of an MKUltra test subject and is the last child to survive the massacre of the facility in 1979. Contrary to popular belief from urban legends, while MKUltra did in fact experiment on children, the project was halted in 1973.[129]
Film[edit]
The 2009 film The Killing Room is a thriller based on the real life MKUltra top secret government psychological program in which various volunteer test subjects are put in a tense situation.[130]
Music[edit]
English band Muse's 2009 album The Resistance features a song titled ""MK Ultra"", which references brainwashing techniques utilised by the CIA in the eponymous project.
Will Wood's 2020 album The Normal Album features a song titled ""BlackBoxWarrior - OKULTRA"", which describes the experience of an MKUltra victim.
The Glasgow-based band Mickey 9s have a song called ""MK Ultra"" in their 2021 album Modern Kunst.
Periphery's 2015 album Juggernaut: Alpha has a song titled ""MK Ultra"".
The title of Machine Girl's 2024 album, MG Ultra, is a reference to MKUltra. Along with this, the album has themes of conspiracy theory and government masking issues throughout.
Punk band Negative Xp has four albums inspired by MK Ultra, titled Mkultra Support Group, Vol. 1-4, and the song ""MKULTRA Victim"" is directly inspired by the project.
Literature[edit]
The sixth and final volume of John Burdett's Bangkok detective novel series, The Bangkok Asset, features MKUltra as a major theme.[131][132] The novel expands the impacts of the program to ultimately include the creation of super soldier-spies with ""transhuman abilities"".
Games[edit]
The 2013 video game Outlast makes explicit references to MK-Ultra, with the games antagonists being mental patients driven insane by mind control experiments.
The main protagonist of the 2020 video game Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, ""Bell"", is a victim of MKUltra and has been brainwashed into believing they served in the Vietnam War.
The video game Visage from 2020 is heavily inspired by the project MKUltra, as it's main character Dwayne Anderson is a scientist who worked on spiking the drinking water with psychedelic drugs. The game also features the views of the projects victims, displaying hallucinations through paranormal events.

What is the Marshall Protocol?,"The Marshall Protocol is a set of guidelines and principles for the peaceful resolution of international disputes. It was developed by US Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson in 1958 and was later adopted by the United Nations.

The Marshall Protocol is based on the following principles:

1. The right of all peoples to self-determination
2. The inadmissibility of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State
3. The inadmissibility of the use of force as a means of settling international disputes
4. The inadmissibility of the use of force as a means of settling international disputes

The Marshall Protocol provides a framework for peaceful resolution of disputes between states. It establishes the right of states to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. It also prohibits the use of force as a means of settling disputes.

The Marshall Protocol has been widely used by the United Nations and its member states to resolve disputes between states. For example, the Protocol was used to resolve the dispute between Israel and Egypt over the Gaza Strip in 1957.

In this case, the United Nations Security Council referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in favor of Egypt. The decision was based on the Marshall Protocol, which prohibited the use of force as a means of settling disputes.

The Marshall Protocol has also been used in other cases, such as the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, and the dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands.

In these cases, the parties agreed to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, such as negotiations or mediation. The United Nations and its member states played a role in facilitating the negotiations and mediation process.

Overall, the Marshall Protocol is an important tool for peaceful resolution of international disputes. It provides a framework for peaceful resolution of disputes, and has been widely used by the United Nations and its member states to resolve disputes between states.",False,https://mpkb.org/home/patients/protocol_overview,"

Introduction to the Marshall Protocol



Related article:  Introduction to the Marshall Pathogenesis



The Marshall ProtocolA curative medical treatment for chronic inflammatory disease. Based on the Marshall Pathogenesis., sometimes referred to as the MP, was developed by a team led by Trevor Marshall, PhD, as an antimicrobial treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases. Most diseases of unknown cause are chronic inflammatory diseases, and over 85% of patients with these diseases have responded to the treatment. On this site and others, chronic inflammatory diseases are sometimes referred to as the Th1 diseasesThe chronic inflammatory diseases caused by bacterial pathogens..


Treatment on the MP requires a number of years to complete, but the exact duration is determined by degree of illness and any unavoidable immune suppressants to which the patient is exposed.


At its essence, the MP involves five key elements, each of which is supported by the latest insights in molecular science. MP patients must:

1 take a minimum 40mg olmesartan (Benicar) every 4-6 hours;
2 avoid inter-personal stress and environmental immune suppression such as radio frequency radiation;   
3 avoid the consumption of vitamin D, as well as certain other immunosuppressive foods;  
4 wean off any immunosuppressive or potentially immunosuppressive therapies;
5 manage exposure to light, depending on blood levels of vitamin D and photosensitivity (if experienced)

Some MP patients also take varying combinations of pulsed, low doses of specific bacteriostatic antibiotics.


The objective of the MP is to safely activate a highly versatile defense, the innate immune responseThe body's first line of defense against intracellular and other pathogens. According to the Marshall Pathogenesis the innate immune system becomes disabled as patients develop chronic disease.. By strengthening the innate immune response, the MP targets the mix of microbes including bacteria, fungi, and viruses that play a role in chronic disease. As pathogens and infected human cells die, they generate inflammationThe complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli such as pathogens or damaged cells. It is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli as well as initiate the healing process for the tissue. (sometimes called a “cytokineAny of various protein molecules secreted by cells of the immune system that serve to regulate the immune system. storm”) and release endotoxins into the body, resulting in a temporary increase in patients' original symptoms. This is known as immunopathologyA temporary increase in disease symptoms experienced by Marshall Protocol patients that results from the release of cytokines and endotoxins as disease-causing bacteria are killed. (generally abbreviated to IP).


The MP is to be administered only by a licensed physician competent in use of the Marshall Protocol. The available evidence for the treatment's effectiveness is described here.


Medications used


The document Marshall Protocol is a one-article summary of key issues related to the Marshall Protocol, especially those relevant to physicians.  Many of the topics covered here are reviewed in greater depth throughout the Knowledge Base. 


Without active participation of patients on MarshallProtocol.com site, Autoimmunity Research FoundationNon-profit foundation dedicated to exploring a pathogenesis and therapy for chronic disease. does not support or license the public use of this therapy.


Avoidance of vitamin D



Main article:  Vitamin D in food






The vitamin D derived from supplements is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-DThe vitamin D metabolite widely (and erroneously) considered best indicator of vitamin D ""deficiency."" Inactivates the Vitamin D Nuclear Receptor. Produced by hydroxylation of vitamin D3 in the liver.), the
form of vitamin D which dysregulates the Vitamin D ReceptorA nuclear receptor located throughout the body that plays a key role in the innate immune response. (VDRThe Vitamin D Receptor. A nuclear receptor located throughout the body that plays a key role in the innate immune response.), to prevent the innate immune
system from functioning properly. Olmesartan (Benicar)Medication taken regularly by patients on the Marshall Protocol for its ability to activate the Vitamin D Receptor. can only restore the function of the innate immune system when it does not have to compete with 25-D at the VDR binding sites. A 25-D level of under 12 ng/ml provides the opportunity for olmesartanMedication taken regularly by patients on the Marshall Protocol for its ability to activate the Vitamin D Receptor. Also known by the trade name Benicar.  to work, and allows the immune system to return to proper function.


Patients on the Marshall ProtocolA curative medical treatment for chronic inflammatory disease. Based on the Marshall Pathogenesis. (MP) are required to avoid all ingested forms of vitamin D.
When the innate immune system returns to proper function, symptoms (immunopathy, or IP)
may increase, but without this return to function, there cannot be cure.


A number of foods contain vitamin D, either naturally or because it has been added during
processing. It is important to read labels. However, sometimes a label will not state that a food
is supplemented with vitamin D. 


The only objective way for a MP patient to determine if they have been successful at avoiding ingesting an excess of vitamin D is to periodically retest their serum 25-D to determine if the target of less than 12 ng/ml has been reached and maintained.

Immunopathology



Main article:  Immunopathology







Related articles:  Managing immunopathology, Science behind immunopathology



Immunopathology (often abbreviated to IP) is what patients experience when they fight an infection. In the context of the Marshall Protocol, immunopathology refers to an increase in one's present symptoms of inflammation, or a return of previous inflammatory symptoms. This  is caused by cytokinesAny of various protein molecules secreted by cells of the immune system that serve to regulate the immune system. and endotoxins being released from dying bacteria. Occasionally, immunopathology will consist of a new symptom or abnormal lab value due to the occurrence of subclinical inflammation that has been revealed by the Marshall Protocol (MP). Immunopathology is a necessary part of recovery for most patients. The amount of immunopathology a patient experiences on the Marshall Protocol (MP) is correlated with disease severity. Patients who are less sick will have comparatively less strong immunopathology.


Immunopathology is sometimes used synonymously with “herx” or the “Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.”


Note that three forms of immunopathology are particularly life-threatening and should be handled with an abundance of caution: cardiac immunopathologyAn exacerbation in symptoms of the heart muscle. Requires careful management by physicians., neurological immunopathologyA temporary exacerbation of neurological symptoms due to bacterial death. Requires careful management by physicians., and respiratory immunopathologyA temporary exacerbation in symptoms of the lungs due to bacterial death. Requires careful management by physicians..

Duration of the Marshall Protocol



Main article:  Duration of the Marshall Protocol







Related article:  Spontaneous remission is a myth



The exact duration of the Marshall Protocol (MP) depends on any number of factors, including degree of illness, amount of fibrosis, ability of the kidneys to process and expel breakdown material, subclinical inflammation, exposure to unavoidable immune suppressants, and personal preference to remain on Olmesartan.


While someone who is very ill might expect the MP to take five or more years, there is no way to know for sure how long the treatment will take. Due to the nature of immunopathology, feelings of well-being and blood markers of disease tend to be variable in the short-term and improve over the long-term. Also owing to the nature of infection, different symptoms will improve at different rates.


So long as one is responding to olmesartan or olmesartan plus antibiotics with symptoms that wax and wane, there are still bacteria to be killed. 


Note that there is no requirement for patients to use 
antibiotics in order to complete the Protocol. In many cases, patients can make considerable progress on olmesartan (Benicar) alone as the drug increases expression of the body's own antimicrobial peptidesBody’s naturally produced broad-spectrum antibacterials which target pathogens..


If choosing to use  antibiotics there is no need to reach the maximum dosages for all antibiotics or do all antibiotic combinations. However, it is considered a good indication of patients' return to health if they no longer experience immunopathology from any antibiotic combination.

Cost of the Marshall Protocol



Main article:  Cost of the Marshall Protocol







Related article:  Insurance coverage



One of the prerequisites for starting on the Marshall ProtocolA curative medical treatment for chronic inflammatory disease. Based on the Marshall Pathogenesis. (MP), a treatment that generally lasts for many years, is the money and/or insurance necessary to pay for certain basic expenses. These expenses include clinic visits, laboratory tests, medications, and special protective sunglasses. Some of these costs are fully or partially covered by insurance. Patients can check their coverage before agreeing to a visit, test or medication so that they are aware of the potential cost. In the United States, insurance coverage varies widely. Patients usually obtain full insurance coverage for the Protocol.
In Australia, cost is modest for those with a pension or Health Benefit card, but the doctor must be prepared to make a case as to why a particular patient requires frequent dosing of OlmesartanMedication taken regularly by patients on the Marshall Protocol for its ability to activate the Vitamin D Receptor. Also known by the trade name Benicar. .
 The support given on the MP study site is free.

Diseases and conditions treated by the Marshall Protocol



Main article:  Diseases







Related article:  Symptoms



According to the Marshall PathogenesisA description for how chronic inflammatory diseases originate and develop., chronic inflammatory disease is caused by a microbiotaThe bacterial community which causes chronic diseases - one which almost certainly includes multiple species and bacterial forms. of bacteria, including L-form bacteriaDifficult-to-culture bacteria that lack a cell wall and are not detectable by traditional culturing processes. Sometimes referred to as cell wall deficient bacteria., biofilm A structured community of microorganisms encapsulated within a self-developed protective matrix and living together. bacteria, and intracellular bacterial forms. These bacterial forms are collectively known as the Th1 pathogens, and they collectively cause the Th1 diseases. Although the exact species and forms of bacteria, as well as the location and extent of the infection, vary between one patient suffering from chronic disease and the next, the disease process is common: bacterial pathogens persist and reproduce by disabling the innate immune response. 


As counterintuitive as the theory of a Th1 Spectrum DisorderThe overlap of different disease symptoms in different patients with similar diagnoses - caused by the fact that any one bacterial species can contribute to numerous disease states. may seem to some medical specialists, it has been the experience of Autoimmunity Research Foundation that nearly all MP patients with inflammatory disease eventually respond with immunopathology–the predictable rise and fall of symptoms, which is taken to be a sign of progress. 


Some diseases are represented by more patients trying the therapy than others. As more patients join the MP cohort, the Autoimmunity Research Foundation will gather more data about the efficacy of the treatment with respect to individual diseases. In the meantime, the MP may be an appropriate treatment option for some of the diseases listed below. 


Many patients have shared their stories of recovery on Marshall protocol study site.

What is the Nipah virus?,"The Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus that is primarily transmitted to humans from fruit bats, Pteropus species. The virus was first identified in Malaysia in 1998, and since then, it has caused outbreaks in several countries, including India, Bangladesh, and Singapore.

The Nipah virus has caused outbreaks in several countries, including India, Bangladesh, and Singapore. In India, the first outbreak was reported in the state of Kerala in 1998, and it caused the deaths of over 100 people. The virus was later detected in other states, including Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

In 2001, an outbreak occurred in Bangladesh, where the virus was responsible for the deaths of over 100 people. The outbreak was particularly severe in the region of Sylhet, where the virus was detected in over 100 people.

In Singapore, the Nipah virus was first detected in 2001, and it caused the deaths of over 10 people. The virus was later detected in other parts of the country, including the island of Jurong.

The Nipah virus has been associated with several outbreaks in India, Bangladesh, and Singapore. The virus has caused outbreaks in several states, including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Delhi.

The Nipah virus is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fever, respiratory problems, and neurological symptoms. The virus can also cause encephalitis, a condition that affects the brain.

In some cases, the Nipah virus can be treated with antiviral drugs. However, the virus is highly contagious and can spread rapidly among people who come into close contact with infected bats or other animals.

The Nipah virus is a serious public health concern, as it can cause outbreaks that can have a significant impact on public health and the economy. The virus is also highly contagious and can spread rapidly among people who come into close contact with infected bats or other animals.

Nipah virus

30 May 2018
















Key facts

Nipah virus infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection (subclinical) to acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis.
The case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75%. This rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management.
Nipah virus can be transmitted to humans from animals (such as bats or pigs), or contaminated foods and can also be transmitted directly from human-to-human.
Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are the natural host of Nipah virus.
There is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals. The primary treatment for humans is supportive care.
The 2018 annual review of the WHO R&D Blueprint list of priority diseases indicates that there is an urgent need for accelerated research and development for the Nipah virus.



OverviewNipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus (it is transmitted from animals to humans) and can also be transmitted through contaminated food or directly between people. In infected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection
    to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. The virus can also cause severe disease in animals such as pigs, resulting in significant economic losses for farmers.  Although Nipah virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern.Past Outbreaks Nipah virus was first recognized in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in, Malaysia. No new outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia since 1999. It was also recognized in Bangladesh in 2001, and nearly annual outbreaks have occurred in that country since. The disease has also been identified periodically in eastern India.Other regions may be at risk for infection, as evidence of the virus has been found in the known natural reservoir (Pteropus bat species) and several other bat species in a number of countries, including Cambodia, Ghana, Indonesia, Madagascar,
    the Philippines, and Thailand.TransmissionDuring the first recognized outbreak in Malaysia, which also affected Singapore, most human infections resulted from direct contact with sick pigs or their contaminated tissues. Transmission is thought to have occurred via unprotected exposure to secretions
    from the pigs, or unprotected contact with the tissue of a sick animal.In subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, consumption of fruits or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was the most likely source of infection.There are currently no studies on viral persistence in bodily fluids or the environment including fruits.Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and care givers of infected patients.During the later outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, Nipah virus spread directly from human-to-human through close contact with people's secretions and excretions. In Siliguri, India in 2001, transmission of the virus was also reported within a health-care
    setting, where 75% of cases occurred among hospital staff or visitors. From 2001 to 2008, around half of reported cases in Bangladesh were due to human-to-human transmission through providing care to infected patients.Signs and symptomsHuman infections range from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory infection (mild, severe), and fatal encephalitis.Infected people initially develop symptoms including fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), vomiting and sore throat. This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis. Some
    people can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours. The incubation period (interval from infection to the onset of symptoms) is believed to range from 4 to 14 days. However, an incubation period as long as 45 days has been reported.Most people who survive acute encephalitis make a full recovery, but long term neurologic conditions have been reported in survivors.  Approximately 20% of patients are left with residual neurological consequences such as seizure disorder and personality
    changes. A small number of people who recover subsequently relapse or develop delayed onset encephalitis.The case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75%. This rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management.DiagnosisInitial signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection are nonspecific, and the diagnosis is often not suspected at the time of presentation.  This can hinder accurate diagnosis and creates challenges in outbreak detection, effective and timely infection
    control measures, and outbreak response activities. In addition, the quality, quantity, type, timing of clinical sample collection and the time needed to transfer samples to the laboratory can affect the accuracy of laboratory results.Nipah virus infection can be diagnosed with clinical history during the acute and convalescent phase of the disease. The main tests used are real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from bodily fluids and antibody detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent
    assay (ELISA). Other tests used include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and virus isolation by cell culture.TreatmentThere are currently no drugs or vaccines specific for Nipah virus infection although WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for the WHO Research and Development Blueprint.  Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory
    and neurologic complications.Natural host: fruit batsFruit bats of the family Pteropodidae – particularly species belonging to the Pteropus genus – are the natural hosts for Nipah virus. There is no apparent disease in fruit bats.It is assumed that the geographic distribution of Henipaviruses overlaps with that of Pteropus category. This hypothesis was reinforced with the evidence of Henipavirus infection in Pteropus bats from Australia, Bangladesh,
    Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Timor-Leste.African fruit bats of the genus Eidolon, family Pteropodidae, were found positive for antibodies against Nipah and Hendra viruses, indicating that these viruses might be present within the geographic distribution of Pteropodidae bats
    in Africa.Nipah virus in domestic animalsOutbreaks of the Nipah virus in pigs and other domestic animals such as horses, goats, sheep, cats and dogs were first reported during the initial Malaysian outbreak in 1999.The virus is highly contagious in pigs. Pigs are infectious during the incubation period, which lasts from 4 to 14 days.An infected pig can exhibit no symptoms, but some develop acute feverish illness, labored breathing, and neurological symptoms such as trembling, twitching and muscle spasms. Generally, mortality is low except in young piglets. These symptoms are not
    dramatically different from other respiratory and neurological illnesses of pigs. Nipah virus should be suspected if pigs also have an unusual barking cough or if human cases of encephalitis are present.For more information of Nipah in animals, see the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) webpage on Nipah.PreventionControlling Nipah virus in pigs
Currently, there are no vaccines available against Nipah virus. Based on the experience gained during the outbreak of Nipah involving pig farms in 1999, routine and thorough cleaning and disinfection of pig farms with appropriate detergents may be effective
    in preventing infection.If an outbreak is suspected, the animal premises should be quarantined immediately.  Culling of infected animals – with close supervision of burial or incineration of carcasses – may be necessary to reduce the risk of transmission to
    people. Restricting or banning the movement of animals from infected farms to other areas can reduce the spread of the disease.As Nipah virus outbreaks have involved pigs and/or fruit bats, establishing an animal health/wildlife surveillance system, using a One Health approach, to detect Nipah cases is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health
    authorities.
Reducing the risk of infection in peopleIn the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce or prevent infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to  the Nipah virus.Public health educational messages should focus on:Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission. Efforts to prevent transmission should first focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and other fresh food products. Keeping bats away from sap collection sites with protective coverings
        (such as bamboo sap skirts) may be helpful. Freshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. Fruits with sign of bat bites should be discarded.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues, and during slaughtering and culling procedures. As much as possible, people should avoid
        being in contact with infected pigs. In endemic areas, when establishing new pig farms, considerations should be given to presence of fruit bats in the area and in general, pig feed and pig shed should be protected against bats when feasible.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission.Close unprotected physical contact with Nipah virus-infected people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people. Controlling infection in health-care settingsHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed infection, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions at all timesAs human-to-human transmission has been reported, in particular in health-care settings, contact and droplet precautions should be used in addition to standard precautions. Airborne precautions may be required in certain circumstances.Samples taken from people and animals with suspected Nipah virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO responseWHO is supporting affected and at risk countries with technical guidance on how to manage outbreaks of Nipah virus and on how to prevent their occurrence.The risk of international transmission via fruits or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption. Fruit with signs of bat bites should be discarded.

What is the Garden Tomb?,"The Garden Tomb is a site located in the city of Jerusalem that is believed by some to be the location of the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth. The Garden Tomb is a large open field located in the heart of the city, next to the Mount of Olives. The site has been the subject of much debate and speculation over the years, with some people believing it to be the true location of Jesus' tomb, while others believe it to be a modern-day construction.

The Garden Tomb is believed by some to be the location of the tomb of Jesus because of the many similarities between the site and the descriptions of Jesus' tomb in the New Testament of the Bible. The site is surrounded by a large wall, which some believe to be a sign of the importance of the location. The wall is said to be the largest in the city and is made of stone.

There are also several other features of the Garden Tomb that are said to be consistent with the biblical descriptions of Jesus' tomb. For example, the site is said to be located in a valley, which some believe to be a reference to the fact that Jesus was buried in a cave. The site is also said to have a large stone marker that is believed to be the location of the rock that was rolled away to reveal Jesus' tomb.

Despite the many similarities between the Garden Tomb and the biblical descriptions of Jesus' tomb, there are also several other features of the site that are said to be inconsistent with these descriptions. For example, some believe that the site is too large to be a single burial site, while others believe that the site is too small to be a burial site for a person of Jesus' stature.

Overall, the Garden Tomb is a complex and fascinating site that is the subject of much debate and speculation. While some people believe it to be the true location of Jesus' tomb, others believe it to be a modern-day construction. Regardless of its true location, the Garden Tomb is an important site in the city of Jerusalem and is visited by many people each year.",False,https://gardentomb.com/,"A site of Christian worship & witness in Jerusalem - The Garden Tomb                         Skip to contentHomeDonateONLINE SHOPInvestPrayJoin UsResourcesBook A VisitThe Garden Tomb in JerusalemCurrent Opening HoursMonday – Thursday 9.00am – 1.00pm Saturday 9.00am – 1.00pm(If you are able to let us know you will be coming, that would be helpful) Please Email: bookings@gardentomb.comWe look forward to welcoming you!Come and see our new Online ShopLocated just outside the city walls of Jerusalem you will find The Garden Tomb, a possible location for the crucifixion, burial and resurrection of Christ Jesus.

What is the Blackhole Exploit Kit?,"Exploit kits are malicious software programs that are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems. The Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK) is a type of exploit kit that has been used to target a variety of devices and systems.

Here are some specific details and examples of the BHEK:

* The BHEK was first reported in 2011 and has been used to target a wide range of devices and systems, including smartphones, tablets, and computers.
* The BHEK is typically distributed through the use of phishing emails that trick victims into downloading and installing a malicious software program.
* Once installed, the BHEK can use a variety of techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in the system, including exploiting known vulnerabilities in popular software applications, such as Adobe Flash Player and Java.
* The BHEK can also use techniques to steal sensitive information from the system, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information.
* The BHEK has been used to target a variety of victims, including individuals, businesses, and government agencies.
* Some of the most high-profile targets of the BHEK include the New York City Police Department and the US Department of Justice.
* The BHEK has been linked to a number of criminal organizations, including the Lazarus Group and the FIN7 Group.

It is important to note that exploit kits like the BHEK are not just a problem for individuals and businesses, but also for governments and other organizations. The use of exploit kits like the BHEK can be used for a variety of malicious activities, including stealing sensitive information, launching DDoS attacks, and launching other types of cyber attacks.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackhole_exploit_kit,"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Malware toolkit
This article is about the exploit kit. For other uses, see black hole (disambiguation).
The Blackhole exploit kit was, as of 2012, the most prevalent web threat, where 29% of all web threats detected by Sophos and 91% by AVG are due to this exploit kit.[1] Its purpose is to deliver a malicious payload to a victim's computer.[2] According to Trend Micro the majority of infections due to this exploit kit were done in a series of high volume spam runs.[3] The kit incorporates tracking mechanisms so that people maintaining the kit know considerable information about the victims arriving at the kit's landing page. The information tracked includes the victim's country, operating system, browser and which piece of software on the victim's computer was exploited. These details are shown in the kit's user interface.[4]


History[edit]
Blackhole exploit kit was released on ""Malwox"", an underground Russian hacking forum. It made its first appearance in 2010.[5]
The supposedly Russian creators use the names ""HodLuM"" and ""Paunch"". It was reported on October 7, 2013 that ""Paunch"" had been arrested.[6]
Dmitry ""Paunch"" Fedotov was sentenced to seven years in a Russian penal colony on April 12, 2016.[7]

Function[edit]
The customer licenses the Blackhole exploit kit from the authors and specifies various options to customize the kit.
A potential victim loads a compromised web page or opens a malicious link in a spammed email.
The compromised web page or malicious link in the spammed email sends the user to a Blackhole exploit kit server's landing page.
This landing page contains obfuscated JavaScript that determines what is on the victim's computers and loads all exploits to which this computer is vulnerable and sometimes a Java applet tag that loads a Java Trojan horse.
If there is an exploit that is usable, the exploit loads and executes a payload on the victim's computer and informs the Blackhole exploit kit server which exploit was used to load the payload.
Defenses[edit]
A typical defensive posture against this and other advanced malware includes, at a minimum, each of the following:

Ensuring that the browser, browser's plugins, and operating system are up to date. The Blackhole exploit kit targets vulnerabilities in old versions of browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari as well as many popular plugins such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Acrobat and Java.
Running a security utility with a good antivirus and good host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS). Due to the polymorphic code used in generating variants of the Blackhole exploit kit, antivirus signatures will lag behind the automated generation of new variants of the Blackhole exploit kit, while changing the algorithm used to load malware onto victims' computers takes more effort from the developers of this exploit kit. A good HIPS will defend against new variants of the Blackhole exploit kit that use previously known algorithms.

What is the Section 245(i) provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act?,"Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is a provision that allows certain individuals who are in the United States illegally to apply for a deferred action with a promise of a future legal status. This provision has been used by individuals who are known as ""Dreamers"" and others who have been brought to the United States as children.

Specific details and examples of the use of Section 245(i) include:

* In 2012, President Obama issued an executive order known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which granted deferred action and work permits to certain individuals who were brought to the United States as children and who had been in the country for many years. This program was later extended by President Trump in 2017, but was later rescinded by President Biden in 2021.
* In 2017, President Trump issued an executive order known as ""Executive Order on Border Security and Immigration Enforcement,"" which included a provision known as ""Executive Order on the Suspension of Entry as a Non-Immigrant Visitor of Certain Aliens in Certain Circumstances."" This order suspended the ability of individuals who were in the United States illegally to enter the country as non-immigrant visitors.
* In 2018, President Trump issued an executive order known as ""Executive Order on the Prevention of Online Disinformation,"" which included a provision known as ""Executive Order on the Suspension of Entry as a Non-Immigrant Visitor of Certain Aliens in Certain Circumstances."" This order suspended the ability of individuals who were in the United States illegally to enter the country as non-immigrant visitors.

These are just a few examples of how Section 245(i) has been used in the past to allow individuals who are in the United States illegally to apply for a deferred action with a promise of a future legal status.",False,https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-eligibility/green-card-through-ina-245i-adjustment,"

Green Card through INA 245(i) Adjustment


Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act and LIFE Act Amendments of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-553 and -554), enables certain individuals who are present in the United States who would not normally qualify to apply for adjustment of status in the United States to obtain lawful permanent residence (get a Green Card) regardless of:The manner they entered the United States;Working in the United States without authorization; orFailing to continuously maintain lawful status since entry.To qualify for this provision, you must be the beneficiary of a labor certification application (Form ETA 750) or immigrant visa petition (Forms I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, or I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker) filed on or before April 30, 2001. You must complete Supplement A to Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, to apply under Section 245(i) provisions and submit it with your Form I-485. In most cases, you must also pay an additional $1,000 fee.For more information, refer to section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).Eligibility CriteriaYou may be eligible to receive a Green Card through section 245(i) if you:Are the beneficiary of a qualified immigrant petition (Form I-130 or I-140) or application for labor certification (Form ETA-750) filed on or before April 30, 2001;Were physically present in the United States on Dec. 21, 2000, if you are the principal beneficiary and the petition was filed between Jan. 15, 1998, and April 30, 2001;Are currently the beneficiary of a qualifying immigrant petition (either the original Form I-130 or I-140 through which you are grandfathered or through a subsequently filed immigrant petition) or an application for labor certification;  Properly file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, and Form I-485 Supplement A;Pay the $1,000 fee (unless exempt);Are physically present in the United States at the time you file Form I-485 and Supplement A;Have a visa immediately available to you;Are admissible to the United States or eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief; andWarrant the favorable exercise of discretion (this means the positive factors in your case outweigh the negative factors).Depending on the circumstances, a spouse or child of a grandfathered individual may also be a grandfathered or may be eligible to adjust status as a dependent under section 245(i) of the INA.Qualifying Petition or Labor CertificationLabor certifications or visa petitions filed to preserve an individual’s adjustment eligibility under Section 245(i) must be both “properly filed” (signed and submitted with the correct fees) and “approvable” (meritorious based on the facts and “non-frivolous”) when filed. To meet this test at a minimum, the filing must be timely (filed by April 30, 2001) and meet all applicable substantive requirements (“approvable when filed”). Deficiencies such as lack of fee or original signature disqualify the submissions.If the Petition Or Labor Certification Is Withdrawn, Denied Or RevokedIf you withdraw the petition, or if USCIS or the former Immigration or Naturalization Service (INS) denied or revoked your petition after approval, you may still be grandfathered, depending on whether the visa petition or labor certification was “approvable when filed.” To remain eligible, the changed circumstances must relate to factors beyond your control rather than the merits of the petition at the time of filing.If the Petitioner Dies Or The Employer Otherwise Is Unable To Maintain The PetitionAs long as the petition or labor certification application was “approvable when filed,” you should remain grandfathered if the:Petitioner dies;Family member who filed the petition divorces you;Employer who filed the labor certification or subsequent Form I-140 goes out of business;Petitioner or the employer chooses to withdraw the petition or labor certification; orPetitioner or employer is otherwise not able to maintain the petition or labor certification application.Application ProcessTo obtain a Green Card, you must file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. You must also file Supplement A to Form I-485, with fees at the same time unless you meet an exception. For more information on exceptions, please see the instructions for Supplement A to Form I-485.Supporting Evidence for Form I-485You should submit all of the following evidence with your Form I-485:Two passport-style photos;A copy of your government issued identity document with photograph;A copy of your birth certificate;A copy of your passport page with a nonimmigrant visa (if applicable);A copy of your passport page with admission (entry) or parole stamp (if applicable);Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Record (if applicable);Form I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record;Form I-864, Affidavit of Support, if applicable;Form I-944, Declaration of Self-Sufficiency, if applicable;Either the concurrently filed immigrant petition or Form I-797, Notice of Action, for the pending or approved immigrant petition that you are using as your basis of adjustment, if you are not adjusting based on the grandfathered immigrant petition;The correct Form I-485 filing fee; andSupplement A to Form I-485 with:A copy of the immigrant petition or labor certification or Form I-797, Notice of Action, that you are using as the basis for 245(i) grandfathering;Proof of your physical presence in the United States on Dec. 21, 2000, if applicable; and$1,000 fee, if applicable.Employment and Travel AuthorizationGenerally, when you have a pending Form I-485, you may apply for employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.You may also apply for an advance parole document by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. An advance parole document authorizes you to appear at a port of entry to seek parole into the United States after temporary travel outside the United States. If you need to leave the United State temporarily while your Form I-485 is pending, please see the Instructions for Form I-131 for more information. Generally, if you have a pending Form I-485 and you leave the United States without an advance parole document, we will consider your application abandoned.For more information, see our Employment Authorization and Travel Documents pages.Adjustment of Status Under Section 245(i) of the INA and LIFE Act ProvisionsMany people mistakenly believe that section 245(i) of the INA constitutes amnesty (that is, forgiveness of unlawful presence or other breaches of status). On the contrary, unlawful presence continues to accrue until you file an application for adjustment of status. Section 245(i) does not protect you from deportation, nor does having a grandfathered petition or application for labor certification place you in a period of stay authorized by the secretary of Homeland Security.For example, if you are illegally in the United States, you accrue unlawful presence until you properly file an application for adjustment of status. If you accrue 180 days or more of unlawful presence in the United States and then depart the United States (even if you previously obtained advance parole), you will trigger a bar to adjustment of status or immigrating on an immigrant visa (a three-year or 10-year bar under section 212(a)(9)(B) of the INA). In most instances, Section 245(i) does not forgive this bar.Other grounds of inadmissibility may apply even though you may have an application for adjustment of status under section 245(i). Unless you obtain a waiver or some other form of relief for any ground of inadmissibility, you may not qualify for adjustment of status under section 245(i).Furthermore, a United States employer who files a labor certification or Form I-140 with an unauthorized individual as beneficiary will be subject to sanctions if they are discovered to be knowingly employing that individual before adjustment of status or USCIS granting work authorization. Filing Form I-485 under section 245(i) does not protect an individual against removal based on an applicable ground of inadmissibility by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Once the individual files Form I-485, they become eligible for work authorization and may work if they apply for and obtain an Employment Authorization Document.Background of Section 245(i) of the INAIn 1994, Congress enacted section 245(i) of the INA, permitting certain individuals who were otherwise ineligible for adjustment of status in the United States to pay a penalty fee for the convenience of adjusting status without leaving the United States. Before enacting the LIFE Act Amendments, the window for preserving adjustment eligibility under section 245(i) ended on Jan. 14, 1998. After that, only “grandfathered” individuals (beneficiaries of labor certifications or immigrant visa petitions filed on or before that date) were eligible to adjust status under section 245(i). The cut-off date of section 245(i) changed several times; however, then-President Clinton signed into law a provision that changed the nature of section 245(i) to “grandfather” those individuals in the United States for whom an immigrant visa or application for labor certification was filed on or before Jan. 14, 1998.On Dec. 21, 2000, the LIFE Act Amendments temporarily restored eligibility under section 245(i) by replacing the previous cut-off date of Jan. 14, 1998, with a new date: April 30, 2001. Accordingly, a beneficiary of a labor certification application or immigrant visa petition filed on or before April 30, 2001, preserves an individual’s eligibility to adjust status under section 245(i) if they meet certain conditions. The LIFE Act added a significant requirement to section 245(i). If the qualifying petition or labor certification was filed after the previous cut-off date of Jan. 14, 1998, the individual must have been physically present in the United States on the date of enactment (Dec. 21, 2000) to qualify for section 245(i) benefits under LIFE.Section 245(i) grandfathers individuals as well as the applications or petitions filed for them. The basis of a grandfathered individual’s eventual adjustment, however, is not restricted to the application or petition filed to preserve adjustment eligibility. The grandfathered individual’s application for adjustment of status may be based on any adjustment provision available to the individual at the time of adjustment.For example, a qualifying Form ETA-750 filed on or before Jan. 14, 1998, preserves the individual’s eligibility to adjust status after that date. However, the filed ETA-750 does not commit that individual to adjustment on the basis of an employment based petition. If, after Jan. 14, 1998, the individual was named as beneficiary in a family based petition or won an immigrant visa in the diversity lottery, they may adjust status on the new basis. (The immigrant visa won in the diversity lottery will not grandfather an individual, but may be used as a basis of adjustment by an individual who is already grandfathered under section 245(i)).

What is the Management by Objectives (MBO) approach?,"Management by Objectives (MBO) is a performance management approach that involves setting specific, measurable, and time-bound objectives for employees, and then tracking their progress towards achieving those objectives. The MBO approach is based on the premise that setting clear goals and objectives for employees can lead to increased motivation, accountability, and performance.

Here are some specific details and examples of the MBO approach:

* Objectives: The first step in the MBO process is to set specific, measurable, and time-bound objectives for employees. These objectives should be aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the organization and should be challenging but achievable. For example, if the overall goal of the organization is to increase sales by 10% in the next fiscal year, the MBO process might involve setting a specific objective for each salesperson to increase their sales quota by 5% in the next quarter.
* Tracking: The next step in the MBO process is to track the progress of employees towards achieving their objectives. This can be done through regular performance evaluations, progress reports, and other forms of feedback. For example, if the sales quota for a salesperson is set at $100,000, the MBO process might involve tracking their progress towards reaching that goal through regular performance evaluations and progress reports.
* Rewards: The MBO approach also involves providing rewards to employees for achieving their objectives. This can include bonuses, promotions, and other forms of recognition. For example, if a salesperson meets their sales quota, they might receive a bonus in addition to their regular salary.
* Feedback: The MBO approach also involves providing feedback to employees on their progress towards achieving their objectives. This can be done through regular performance evaluations and progress reports, as well as through other forms of feedback. For example, if a salesperson is struggling to meet their sales quota, they might receive feedback on their performance and receive guidance on how to improve their sales skills.

Overall, the MBO approach is a performance management approach that involves setting specific, measurable, and time-bound objectives for employees, tracking their progress towards achieving those objectives, providing rewards for achieving those objectives, and providing feedback on their progress towards achieving those objectives. The MBO approach is based on the premise that setting clear goals and objectives for employees can lead to increased motivation, accountability, and performance.",True,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/management-by-objectives.asp,"

  What Is Management by Objectives (MBO)?  
 Management by objectives (MBO) is a strategic management model that aims to improve the performance of an organization by clearly defining objectives that are agreed to by both management and employees. According to the theory, having a say in goal setting and action plans encourages participation and commitment among employees, and aligns objectives across the organization.


Key Takeaways
Management by objectives (MBO) is a process in which a manager and an employee agree on specific performance goals and then develop a plan to reach them.It is designed to align objectives throughout an organization and boost employee participation and commitment.There are five steps: define objectives, share them with employees, encourage employees to participate, monitor progress, and finally, evaluate performance and reward achievements.Critics of MBO argue that it incentivizes employees to achieve these goals by any means necessary, often at the cost of the company.
 





 
 Katie Kerpel / Investopedia

  Understanding Management by Objectives (MBO)  
 Management by objectives (also known as management by planning) is the establishment of a management information system (MIS) to compare actual performance and achievements with the defined objectives. Practitioners claim the major benefits of MBO are that it improves employee motivation and commitment and allows for better communication between management and employees.


 However, a cited weakness of MBO is that it unduly emphasizes the setting of goals to attain objectives, rather than working on a systematic plan to do so. Critics of MBO, such as W. Edwards Deming, argue that setting particular goals like production targets leads workers to meet those targets by any means necessary, including shortcuts that result in poor quality.


 In his book that coined the term, Peter Drucker set forth several principles for MBO. Objectives are laid out with the help of employees and are meant to be challenging but achievable. Employees receive daily feedback, and the focus is on rewards rather than punishment. Personal growth and development are emphasized, rather than negative feedback for failing to reach objectives.


Note
MBO is not a cure-all but a tool to be utilized. It gives organizations a process, with many practitioners claiming that the success of MBO is dependent on the support from top management, clearly outlined objectives, and trained managers who can implement it.
  Steps of MBO  
 MBO outlines five steps that organizations should use to put the management technique into practice.



Either determine or revise organizational objectives for the entire company. This broad overview should be derived from the firm’s mission and vision.
Translate the organizational objectives to employees. In 1981, George T. Doran used the acronym SMART (specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic, time-bound) to express the concept.
Stimulate the participation of employees in setting individual objectives. After the organization’s objectives are shared with employees from the top to the bottom, employees should be encouraged to help set their own objectives to achieve these larger organizational objectives. This gives employees greater motivation since they have greater empowerment.
Monitor the progress of employees. In this way, managers can measure and track the goals set by employees. As step two states, a key component of the objectives is that they are measurable for employees and managers to determine how well they are met across a given timeframe.
Evaluate and reward employee progress. This step includes honest feedback on what was achieved and not achieved for each employee.


  Advantages and Disadvantages MBO  
 MBO comes with many advantages and disadvantages.


  Advantages  

Employees take pride in their work and are assigned goals they know they can achieve that match their strengths, skills, and educational experiences.
Assigning tailored goals brings a sense of importance to employees, boosting their output and loyalty to the company.
Communication between management and employees is increased.
Management can create goals that lead to the success of the company.


  Disadvantages  

As MBO is focused on goals and targets, it often ignores other parts of a company, such as the culture of conduct, a healthy work ethos, and areas for involvement and contribution.
Strain is increased on employees to meet the goals in a specified time frame.
Employees are encouraged to meet targets by any means necessary, meaning that shortcuts could be taken and the quality of work compromised.
If management solely relies on MBO for all management responsibilities, it can be problematic for areas that don’t fit under MBO.


 What Is the Goal of Management by Objectives (MBO)?
Management by objectives (MBO) uses a set of quantifiable or objective standards against which to measure the performance of a company and its employees. By comparing actual productivity to a given set of standards, managers can identify problem areas and improve efficiency. Both management and workers know and agree to these standards and their objectives.


 What Is an Example of MBO?
A company can set various goals with its employees. In the case of a call center, an MBO could increase customer satisfaction, say, by 10%, while reducing call times by one minute. The onus is now on finding ways to achieve this goal. Once that’s decided on, it’s important to get employees on board and then monitor their progress, provide feedback, and reward those who do a good job.


 What Are Some Drawbacks of Using MBO?
As MBO is entirely focused on goals and targets, it often ignores other parts of a company, such as the corporate culture, worker conduct, a healthy work ethos, environmental issues, and areas for involvement and contribution to the community and social good.


 What Is the Difference Between MBO and Management by Exception (MBE)?
In management by exception (MBE), management only addresses instances where objectives or standards are transgressed. Thus, workers are left alone unless productivity is not met.


  The Bottom Line  
 As a theory, MBO makes a lot of sense: if employees are involved in setting company goals, they are more likely to share management’s objectives, work harder, and deliver.


 However, there’s also a good reason why MBO is widely criticized. Like most things that look good on paper, it doesn’t always work in practice. The key is to be aware of its drawbacks, customize the plan according to your organization, ensure that everyone is fully on board, and identify objectives that are clear and reasonable before putting them into action.

What is the Big Mac Index?,"The Big Mac Index is a term coined by economist and author Scott Galloway to describe the relative value of currencies in different countries. The concept is based on the idea that the price of a Big Mac hamburger, which is standardized across countries, should be the same in all countries. If the price of a Big Mac is different in different countries, then the exchange rate between those currencies is said to be ""cheap"" or ""expensive"".

To calculate the Big Mac Index, a team of economists and food industry experts select a representative country and a representative Big Mac menu. They then determine the cost of a Big Mac in that country and compare it to the price of a Big Mac in the United States. If the price of a Big Mac in the representative country is higher than in the United States, then the exchange rate between the two currencies is said to be ""cheap"". If the price of a Big Mac in the representative country is lower than in the United States, then the exchange rate is said to be ""expensive"".

The Big Mac Index has been used as a tool for economic analysis and as a way to compare the purchasing power of different currencies. It has been criticized for its limitations, such as its reliance on a single product and its lack of consideration for other factors that may impact the cost of living. However, it remains a popular and accessible tool for understanding currency exchange rates and for exploring the relationship between currencies and the cost of living.",False,https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/big-mac-index.asp,"

  What Is the Big Mac Index?  
 The Big Mac index is a survey created by The Economist magazine in 1986 to measure purchasing power parity (PPP) between nations, using the price of a McDonald's Big Mac as the benchmark.


 Purchasing power parity is an economic theory stating that exchange rates over time should move toward equality across national borders in the price charged for an identical basket of goods. In this case, the basket of goods is a Big Mac.


 The Big Mac Index is also known as the Big Mac PPP or Burgernomics.


Key Takeaways
The Big Mac Index was created to measure the disparities in consumer purchasing power between nations.The burger replaces the ""basket of goods"" traditionally used by economists to measure differences in consumer pricing.The index was created with tongue in cheek, but many economists say it's roughly accurate.
  Understanding the Big Mac Index  
 According to PPP theory, any change in the exchange rate between nations should be reflected in a change in the price of a basket of goods.


 One of the key insights of the Big Mac Index is that a basket of goods in one country can rarely be precisely duplicated in another country. For example, an American basket of groceries and a Japanese basket of groceries will likely contain very different products. A Big Mac, though, is always a Big Mac, allowing for slight local differences in ingredients.


 The editors of The Economist stress that the index should not be taken too seriously. ""Burgernomics was never intended as a precise gauge of currency misalignment, merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more digestible,"" an explainer on the site indicates.



Based on the Big Mac Index, the British pound was undervalued by 3.61% against the U.S. dollar in 2024.
 Nevertheless, the Big Mac Index has become a global standard for price comparison. The Economist website shows the index in 54 countries, revealing that a Big Mac is relatively pricey in Switzerland, while people in Indonesia, India, and Taiwan are getting a bargain.


  The Big Mac Index In Use  
 In June 2024, The Economist concluded that a Big Mac cost $5.69 in the U.S. and £4.67 in the U.K. The difference between the implied exchange rate of 0.75 and the actual exchange rate of 0.78 suggests the undervaluation.


 As The Economist editors are quick to note, the Big Mac Index is not a perfect instrument.


 As of 2024, McDonald's has outlets in 118 countries and territories. Thus, this methodology cannot be used to analyze the PPP between the U.S. dollar and countries without a McDonald's, such as Iceland.


 Nevertheless, economists consider the index to be a relatively accurate real-world indicator of local economic purchasing power since the pricing of a Big Mac, like most consumer goods, must take into account local costs of raw materials, labor, taxes, and business premises.


 What Is the Big Mac Index?
The Big Mac index is a measurement sometimes used to discern the difference in purchasing power parity between two countries where BicMacs are sold. It began as somewhat of an economics joke, but it turned out to be fairly reliable.


 Is the Big Mac Index a Good Indicator of Inflation?
The costs of raw materials, labor, transportation, taxes, and others are priced into Big Macs, so it is safe to say that the price of a Big Mac can reflect inflationary pressures.


 What Is the Most Accurate Inflation Indicator?
The Consumer Price Index, calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered the most accurate indication of inflation.


  The Bottom Line  
 The Big Mac Index measures the cost of a Big Mac in different countries and indicates the difference in purchasing power parity between them. It has become accepted as a fairly reliable currency parity indicator for developed, developing, and non-developed countries (as long as Big Macs are sold there).

What are the requirements for obtaining an H-1B visa?,"Obtaining an H-1B visa is a complex process that requires meeting specific requirements and fulfilling certain conditions. Here are some of the key requirements and examples:

1. Qualifications:
To qualify for an H-1B visa, the applicant must have a bachelor's degree or higher in a field that is directly related to the job offered. For example, if an applicant is applying for an H-1B visa to work as a software developer, they must have a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field.
2. Job Offer:
The applicant must have a job offer from a U.S. employer that is authorized to sponsor H-1B visas. The job offer must be in effect, and the employer must have the legal right to sponsor the H-1B worker. For example, if an employer is sponsoring an H-1B worker to work at a company in California, the job offer must be in effect in California and the employer must have the legal right to sponsor the worker.
3. Labor Condition Application (LCA):
The applicant must also have a Labor Condition Application (LCA) filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA verifies that the job offered to the H-1B worker is legitimate, and that the employer has complied with the terms of the H-1B program. For example, if an employer is sponsoring an H-1B worker to work at a company in California, the employer must file an LCA with the U.S. Department of Labor to verify that the job offered is legitimate and that the employer has complied with the terms of the H-1B program.
4. Labor Condition Waiver:
In some cases, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may allow an H-1B worker to work in the U.S. without a Labor Condition Application (LCA), if the employer can demonstrate that the job is not available to U.S. workers, or if the employer can demonstrate that the job is not being offered at a salary that is competitive with the prevailing wage for the area. For example, if an employer is sponsoring an H-1B worker to work at a company in California, the employer may be able to demonstrate that the job is not available to U.S. workers, or that the job is being offered at a salary that is competitive with the prevailing wage for the area.
5. Employer's Eligibility:
The employer must also be eligible to sponsor H-1B visas. This includes meeting certain financial and labor certification requirements, as well as complying with other legal requirements. For example, if an employer is sponsoring an H-1B worker to work at a company in California, the employer must be a U.S. employer, and the employer must have the legal right to sponsor the worker.
6. Labor Condition Reporting:
After the H-1B worker has been employed in the U.S. for 30 or more days, the employer must file a Labor Condition Report with the U.S. Department of Labor. The Labor Condition Report verifies that the worker is being employed in the same job as described in the Labor Condition Application (LCA) and that the employer has complied with the terms of the H-1B program. For example, if an employer is sponsoring an H-1B worker to work at a company in California, the employer must file a Labor Condition Report with the U.S. Department of Labor to verify that the worker is being employed in the same job as described in the LCA and that the employer has complied with the terms of the H-1B program.

These are some of the key requirements for obtaining an H-1B visa. The specific requirements and conditions may vary depending on the individual case and the employer's circumstances. It is important to consult with a qualified immigration attorney or other professional to ensure that the application is complete and accurate, and to address any potential issues or concerns.",True,https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations,"

Regardless of whether a visa is required, the prospective H-1B worker must then apply to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for admission to the United States in H-1B classification.Labor Condition Application (LCA)Prospective specialty occupation and distinguished fashion model employers/agents must obtain a certification of an LCA from the DOL. This application includes certain attestations, a violation of which can result in fines, bars on sponsoring nonimmigrant or immigrant petitions, and other sanctions to the employer/agent. The application requires the employer/agent to attest that it will comply with the following labor requirements:The employer/agent will pay the H-1B worker a wage that is no less than the wage paid to similarly qualified workers or, if greater, the prevailing wage for the position in the geographic area in which the H-1B worker will be working.The employer/agent will provide working conditions that will not adversely affect other similarly employed workers.At the time of the labor condition application there is no strike or lockout at the place of employment.Notice of the filing of the labor condition application with the DOL has been given to the union bargaining representative or has been posted at the place of employment.Period of StayAs an H-1B specialty occupation worker, you may be admitted for a period of up to 3 years. Your time period may be extended, but generally cannot go beyond a total of 6 years.However, you may be eligible for an H-1B extension beyond the sixth year under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(E) if you are the beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition under the EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 classifications, and are eligible to be granted that immigrant status but for application of the per country or worldwide limitations on immigrant visas. Petitioners must demonstrate the visa is not available as of the date they file an H-1B petition with USCIS. We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 3-year increments until we make a final decision to revoke the approval of the immigrant visa petition or to approve or deny your application for an immigrant visa or application to adjust status to lawful permanent residence.Alternatively, under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(D), you may be eligible for an H-1B extension beyond the sixth year if at least 365 days have passed since a labor certification was filed with the Department of Labor on your behalf (if such certification is required) or an immigrant visa petition was filed with USCIS on your behalf. You are ineligible for this extension beyond the sixth year if you fail to file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa within 1 year of an immigrant visa being available. If the accrual of such 1-year period is interrupted by the unavailability of an immigrant visa, you will have a new 1-year period after an immigrant visa again becomes immediately available, during which you generally must file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa.

Your employer is not responsible for the costs of your return transportation if you voluntarily resign from your position. For more information, please see Options for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment.H-1B CapThe H-1B classification has an annual numerical limit (cap) of 65,000 new statuses/visas each fiscal year. An additional 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries who have earned a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education are exempt from the cap. Additionally, H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities, a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization, are not subject to this numerical cap.For further information about the numerical cap, see our H-1B Cap Season page.Changing Employers or Employment Terms with the Same Employer (Portability)Changing EmployersWhen can I begin working for a new H-1B employer if I change employers?If you are changing H-1B employers, you may begin working for the new employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous Form I-129 petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later.To be eligible for portability, you must not have been employed without authorization from the time of your last admission into the United States, and your new employer must properly file a new, non-frivolous petition before your H-1B period of authorized stay expires.Will I still have employment authorization if I change employers?If you are eligible for H-1B portability, your employment is authorized until USCIS has made a decision on the Form I-129.If the new I-129 petition is approved, you may continue working for the new employer for the period of time indicated on the new petition approval.If the new petition is denied, you may continue working for your previous employer if your prior period of authorized employment is still valid, but your authorization to work based on portability ceases upon denial of the petition.If you are laid off, fired, quit, or otherwise cease employment with your previous employer, you may have up to 60 consecutive days or until the end of your authorized validity period, whichever is shorter, to find new employment, change status, or depart the country.Can I move from cap-exempt to cap-subject employment?If you are moving from cap-exempt to cap-subject employment, your new employer’s H‑1B petition will be subject to the H-1B cap. If subject to the cap, your new employer must first submit an electronic registration when registration period opens. This is typically in March.If more unique beneficiaries are registered than projected as needed to meet the cap for a given fiscal year, unique beneficiaries of properly submitted registrations will be randomly selected. All registrants of selected beneficiaries will be notified of selection and selection notices will be uploaded to their account informing them that they may file a petition for the beneficiary named in the selection notice during the applicable filing period.  H-1B cap petitions must have a start date of Oct. 1 (or later) of the applicable fiscal year and may not be filed more than 6 months before the requested start date on the petition.If you are currently employed in a cap-exempt position, you may engage in concurrent employment in a cap-subject position as long as you will continue to be employed in the cap-exempt position. You may begin working concurrently for the cap-subject employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous Form I-129 petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later. As long as you continue your cap-exempt employment, were previously counted toward the cap, or otherwise remain cap exempt, you will not become subject to the H-1B cap again during the same H-1B validity period.Changing Employment Terms with the Same EmployerWhat if I want to start new employment or change employment terms with my current employer?Form I-129 is also used to request new employment or a change of employment with the same employer.If your current H-1B employer properly files a non-frivolous Form I-129 requesting new employment or a change of employment on your behalf, you are authorized to work according to the terms of the new or changed employment once that petition is filed, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later.Family of H-1B NonimmigrantsYour spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in the H-4 nonimmigrant classification.

What is the School of Athens?,"The School of Athens is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, completed in 1511. The painting is an allegorical depiction of the philosophers and thinkers of ancient Greece, and is considered one of the most famous and important works of art in the history of Western art.

The School of Athens depicts a group of philosophers, scientists, and thinkers gathered around a central figure, which is traditionally considered to be the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. The painting is divided into two main sections, with the left side featuring the philosophers and scientists of ancient Greece, and the right side featuring the philosophers and thinkers of modern times.

The left side of the painting features a diverse group of ancient Greek philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, and Pythagoras. The figures on this side of the painting are depicted in a more naturalistic style, with the figures interacting with each other and with the surrounding environment.

The right side of the painting features a group of more modern philosophers and thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, René Descartes, and Leonardo da Vinci. The figures on this side of the painting are depicted in a more stylized and abstract style, with the figures interacting with each other and with the surrounding environment through symbols and motifs.

The School of Athens is considered to be one of the most important works of art in the history of Western art, and it is often cited as an example of the Renaissance humanism movement. The painting is a symbol of the intellectual and cultural achievements of ancient Greece, and it is also seen as a symbol of the power of art to inspire and influence people.

The School of Athens is a unique and important work of art, and it has been the subject of much critical analysis and interpretation over the years. The painting is considered to be a symbol of the intellectual and cultural achievements of ancient Greece, and it is also seen as a symbol of the power of art to inspire and influence people.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens,"

Fresco by Raphael
For the school of philosophy of classical Athens, see Platonic Academy. For the U.S. preparatory school, see Athenian School.


The School of AthensArtistRaphaelYear1509–1511TypeFrescoDimensions500 cm × 770 cm (200 in × 300 in)LocationApostolic Palace, Vatican Museums, Vatican City
The School of Athens (Italian: Scuola di Atene) is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as part of a commission by Pope Julius II to decorate the rooms now called the Stanze di Raffaello in the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City. 
The fresco depicts a congregation of ancient philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists, with Plato and Aristotle featured in the center. The identities of most figures are ambiguous or discernable only through subtle details or allusions;[1] among those commonly identified are Socrates, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Heraclitus, Averroes, and Zarathustra. Additionally, Italian artists Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo are believed to be portrayed through Plato and Heraclitus, respectively.[2][3] Raphael included a self-portrait beside Ptolemy. Raphael is the second character who is looking directly at the viewer in the artwork, the first being Hypatia - a woman in the white robe, who stands between Parmenides and Pythagoras.
The painting is notable for its use of accurate perspective projection, a defining characteristic of Renaissance art, which Raphael learned from Leonardo; likewise, the themes of the painting, such as the rebirth of Ancient Greek philosophy and culture in Europe were inspired by Leonardo's individual pursuits in theatre, engineering, optics, geometry, physiology, anatomy, history, architecture and art.[4]
The School of Athens is regarded as one of Raphael's best-known works and has been described as his ""masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance"".[5]


Program, subject, figure identifications and interpretations[edit]
The Stanza della Segnatura
The Stanza della Segnatura was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and The School of Athens, representing philosophy, is believed to be the third painting to be finished there, after La Disputa (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the Parnassus (Literature).[6]
The School of Athens is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each theme is identified above by a separate tondo containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with putti bearing the phrases: ""Seek Knowledge of Causes"", ""Divine Inspiration"", ""Knowledge of Things Divine"" (Disputa), ""To Each What Is Due"". Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify philosophy, poetry (including music), theology, and justice.[7][8] The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the painting is actually philosophy, or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, ""Causarum Cognitio"", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo Aristotle's emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in Metaphysics Book I and Physics Book II. Indeed, Plato and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, many of the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' monad.

Bramante as Euclid
Zoroaster, Ptolemy, Raphael as Apelles and Perugino, Il Sodoma or Timoteo Viti as Protogenes
Commentators have suggested that nearly every great ancient Greek philosopher can be found in the painting, but determining which are depicted is speculative, since Raphael made no designations outside possible likenesses, and no contemporary documents explain the painting. Compounding the problem, Raphael had to invent a system of iconography to allude to various figures for whom there were no traditional visual types. For example, while the Socrates figure is immediately recognizable from Classical busts, one of the figures alleged to be Epicurus is far removed from his standard depiction. 
Aspects of the fresco other than the identities of the figures have also been variously interpreted, but few such interpretations are unanimously accepted among scholars. That the rhetorical gestures of Plato and Aristotle are kinds of pointing (to the heavens, and down to earth) is popularly accepted as likely. However, Plato's Timaeus – which is the book Raphael places in his hand – was a sophisticated treatment of space, time, and change, including the Earth, which guided mathematical sciences for over a millennium. Aristotle, with his four-elements theory, held that all change on Earth was owing to motions of the heavens. In the painting Aristotle carries his Ethics, which he denied could be reduced to a mathematical science. It is not certain how much the young Raphael knew of ancient philosophy, what guidance he might have had from people such as Bramante and whether a detailed program was dictated by his sponsor, Pope Julius II.
Nevertheless, the fresco has often been interpreted as an exhortation to philosophy and as a visual representation of the role of Love in elevating people toward higher knowledge, in consonance with contemporary theories of Marsilio Ficino and other neo-Platonic thinkers linked to Raphael.[9]
Finally, according to Giorgio Vasari, the scene includes accurate portraits of Raphael himself, the Duke of Mantua, Zoroaster and some Evangelists.[10]
However, to Heinrich Wölfflin, ""it is quite wrong to attempt interpretations of the School of Athens as an esoteric treatise ... The all-important thing was the artistic motive which expressed a physical or spiritual state, and the name of the person was a matter of indifference"" in Raphael's time.[11] Raphael's artistry then orchestrates a beautiful space, continuous with that of viewers in the Stanza, in which a great variety of human figures, each one expressing ""mental states by physical actions"", interact, in a ""polyphony"" unlike anything in earlier art, in the ongoing dialogue of Philosophy.[12]
An interpretation of the fresco relating to hidden symmetries of the figures and the star constructed by Bramante was given by Guerino Mazzola and collaborators.[13] The main basis are two mirrored triangles on the drawing from Bramante (Euclid), which correspond to the feet positions of certain figures.[14]
Paolo Zamboni, professor of vascular surgery at the University of Ferrara, made a medical study of the painting, noting that Raphael's depiction of Michelangelo (as Heraclitus) shows varicose veins in the legs.[15]

Figures[edit]
The identities of some of the philosophers in the picture, such as Plato and Aristotle, have been ascertained. Several other of Raphael's figures have been the subject of conjecture. Some have received multiple identifications, both as depictions of ancients and as portraits of Raphael's contemporaries. Vasari mentions a portrait of the young Duke of Mantua, leaning over Bramante with his hands raised near the bottom right, and a self-portrait of Raphael himself.[16]

Central figures (14 and 15)[edit]
An elder Plato walks alongside a younger Aristotle.
In the center of the fresco, at its architecture's central vanishing point, are the two undisputed main subjects: Plato on the left and his student Aristotle on the right. Both figures hold contemporary (of the time) bound copies of their books in their left hands, while gesturing with their right. Plato holds Timaeus and Aristotle holds his Nicomachean Ethics. Plato is depicted as old, grey, and barefoot. By contrast, Aristotle, slightly ahead of him, is in mature manhood, wearing sandals and gold-trimmed robes, and the youths about them seem to look his way. In addition, these two central figures gesture along different dimensions: Plato vertically, upward along the picture-plane, into the vault above; Aristotle on the horizontal plane at right-angles to the picture-plane (hence in strong foreshortening), initiating a flow of space toward viewers.
It is popularly thought that their gestures indicate central aspects of their philosophies: for Plato, his Theory of Forms, and for Aristotle, an emphasis on concrete particulars. Many interpret the painting to show a divergence of the two philosophical schools. Plato argues a sense of timelessness whilst Aristotle looks into the physicality of life and the visible world.

Setting[edit]
Detail of the architecture
The building is in the shape of a Greek cross, which some have suggested was intended to show a harmony between pagan philosophy and Christian theology[5] (see Christianity and Paganism and Christian philosophy). The architecture of the building was inspired by the work of Bramante, who, according to Vasari, helped Raphael with the architecture in the picture.[5] The resulting architecture was similar to the then new St. Peter's Basilica.[5]
There are two sculptures in the background. The one on the left is the god Apollo, god of light, archery and music, holding a lyre.[5] The sculpture on the right is Athena, goddess of wisdom, in her Roman guise as Minerva.[5]
The main arch, above the characters, shows a meander (also known as a Greek fret or Greek key design), a design using continuous lines that repeat in a ""series of rectangular bends"" which originated on pottery of the Greek Geometric period and then became widely used in ancient Greek architectural friezes.[17]

Drawings and cartoon[edit]
A number of drawings made by Raphael as studies for the School of Athens are extant.[18] A study for the Diogenes is in the Städel in Frankfurt[19] while a study for the group around Pythagoras, in the lower left of the painting, is preserved in the Albertina Museum in Vienna.[20] Several drawings, showing the two men talking while walking up the steps on the right and the Medusa on Athena's shield,[21][a] the statue of Athena (Minerva) and three other statues,[23] a study for the combat scene in the relief below Apollo[24] and ""Euclid"" teaching his pupils[25] are in the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Oxford.
The cartoon for the painting is in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan.[26] Missing from it is the architectural background, the figures of Heraclitus, Raphael, and Protogenes. The group of the philosophers in the left foreground strongly recall figures from Leonardo's Adoration of the Magi.[27] Additionally, there are some engravings of the scene's sculptures by Marcantonio Raimondi; they may have been based on lost drawings by Raphael, as they do not match the fresco exactly.[28]

Copies[edit]
The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has a rectangular copy over 4 metres by 8 metres in size, painted on canvas, dated 1755 by Anton Raphael Mengs, on display in the eastern Cast Court.[29]
Modern reproductions of the fresco abound. For example, a full-size one can be seen in the auditorium of Old Cabell Hall at the University of Virginia. Produced in 1902 by George W. Breck to replace an older reproduction that was destroyed in a fire in 1895, it is four inches off scale from the original, because the Vatican would not allow identical reproductions of its art works.[30]
A 1689 tapestry reproduction by the Gobelins Manufactory and commissioned by Louis XIV hangs above the presiding officer's platform in the French National Assembly chamber.[31] It had been removed in 2017 for a three-year restoration process undertaken by the Mobilier National, which manages Gobelins Manufactory.
Other reproductions include: in Königsberg Cathedral, Kaliningrad by Neide,[32] in the University of North Carolina at Asheville's Highsmith University Student Union, and a recent one in the seminar room at Baylor University's Brooks College. A copy of Raphael's School of Athens was painted on the wall of the ceremonial stairwell that leads to the famous, main-floor reading room of the Sainte-Geneviève Library in Paris.
The two figures to the left of Plotinus were used as part of the cover art of both Use Your Illusion I and II albums of Guns N' Roses.

Precursors[edit]
Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii
Similar subjects are known from antiquity, notably the Plato's Academy mosaic. It perhaps also appeared in two groups of statues from Roman Egypt. The 19th century French consul Jean-François Mimaut mentioned nine statues at the Serapeum of Alexandria holding rolls, while eleven statues were found at the Memphis Saqqara. A review of ""Les Statues Ptolémaïques du Sarapieion de Memphis"" ascribed them to the 3rd century, sculpted of limestone and stucco, some standing and others sitting. Rowe and Rees 1956 suggested that both statue groups share a similar subject to the Plato's Academy mosaic, with the Saqqara figures identified as: ""(1) Pindare, (2) Démétrios de Phalère, (3) x (?), (4) Orphée (?) aux oiseaux,[33] (5) Hésiode, (6) Homère, (7) x (?), (8) Protagoras, (9) Thalès, (10) Héraclite, (11) Platon, (12) Aristote (?).""[34][35] However, there have been other suggestions (e.g. Mattusch 2008). Plato and Thales are commonly identified as central figures.[36]

What is the Blue Brain Project?,"The Blue Brain Project is a research initiative aiming to understand the neural basis of cognition and consciousness by reconstructing the structure of the human brain. The project is named after the color of the brain's gray matter, which is blue.

The Blue Brain Project is a collaboration between scientists, researchers, and engineers from several institutions, including the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), the Collège de France, and the University of Zurich. The project's goal is to reconstruct the 3D structure of the human brain's gray matter using high-resolution imaging techniques and cutting-edge computer simulations.

The project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). The project has received significant media attention, including coverage in popular science publications such as The New York Times and Scientific American.

In 2017, the Blue Brain Project announced the release of its first simulation of the human brain's cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain responsible for processing sensory information and generating motor commands. This simulation was created using 3D imaging data from the Human Brain Project, a collaboration between several institutions that aims to reconstruct the entire human brain.

In 2019, the Blue Brain Project released a new simulation of the human brain's entire cortex, which includes both the gray and white matter. This simulation was created using data from the Human Connectome Project, a collaboration between several institutions that aims to map the connections between brain regions in the human brain.

The Blue Brain Project has also developed a software platform called BrainScaleS, which allows researchers to simulate the behavior of neural networks and test hypotheses about how the brain processes information. The platform has been used to study a range of brain functions, including memory, attention, and decision-making.

In summary, the Blue Brain Project is a research initiative that aims to understand the neural basis of cognition and consciousness by reconstructing the structure of the human brain. The project is funded by the European Research Council and the Swiss National Science Foundation, and has received significant media attention. The project has released several simulations of the human brain's cortex, and has developed a software platform called BrainScaleS that allows researchers to simulate the behavior of neural networks.",False,https://bbp.epfl.ch/bbp/research/domains/bluebrain/index.html,"

Blue Brain Project
The Blue Brain Project was a Swiss National Research Infrastructure project, that ran from 2005 to the end of 2024. Led by Founder and Director Professor Henry Markram, Blue Brain established simulation neuroscience as a complementary approach to understanding the brain alongside experimental, theoretical, and clinical neuroscience.



















EPFL’s Blue Brain Project is a Swiss brain research Initiative led by Founder and Director Professor Henry Markram.
This mission was completed after developing all the main algorithms required to build biologically faithful digital copies of the brain, including; 

Generating the volumes and dimensions of all brain regions,
Populating neurons and glia according to their densities and distributions in each brain region, 
Defining morphological, electrical, and genetic cell types in each brain region, 
Computationally growing the dendrites of an unlimited number of neurons expressing their variety of morphological types in each brain region, 
Modeling an unlimited number of neurons expressing their variety of electrical behaviors, 
Growing all the local, regional and whole brain axons of every type of neuron in the mouse brain
Recreating the connectome down to a neuron to neuron level,
Modeling various types of synapse formed between any two neurons in the brain, 
Simulating neurons, brain regions, brain systems and the whole mouse brain on supercomputers and in the cloud.

The aim of Blue Brain is to establish simulation neuroscience as a complementary approach alongside experimental, theoretical and clinical neuroscience to understanding the brain, by building the world’s first biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain. 
The supercomputer-based simulations and reconstructions built by Blue Brain offer a radically new approach for understanding the multi-level structure and function of the brain.

All the algorithms (which represent over 18 million lines of code), models and data were published in around 300 peer-reviewed papers and were packaged in an open data platform to leverage and continue advancing simulation neuroscience. 

Blue Brain Simulation Neuroscience Platform


From 2025, an independent not-for-profit foundation is launched to support the global community in utilizing simulation neuroscience to study the brain and its diseases. The foundation provides virtual neuroscience labs, enabling users to explore, build, and simulate digital replicas of parts or entire brains, potentially for any species, age, gender, or condition.
Funding
Blue Brain was funded by the Swiss federal government, with oversight provided by the ETH Board and hosting provided by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

What is the Special Drawing Rights (SDR)?,"The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is a reserve asset of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is a basket of currencies, which includes the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and pound sterling. The SDR was introduced in 1969 as a way to provide a common reserve asset for member countries of the IMF.

The SDR is managed by the IMF and is used to supplement the member countries' official reserves. The SDR is not a legal tender, but it is used as a means of exchange for the IMF's quota and for the settlement of IMF transactions. The SDR is also used as a reference for the calculation of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights reserve asset.

What is the SDR?
The SDR is an international reserve asset. The SDR is not a currency, but its value is based on a basket of five currencies—the US dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling.


LEARN MORE   Q&A on SDRs   ONLINE COURSE ON SDRs





What is the purpose of the SDR?





The IMF created the SDR as a supplementary international reserve asset in 1969, when currencies were tied to the price of gold and the US dollar was the leading international reserve asset. The IMF defined the SDR as equivalent to a fractional amount of gold that was equivalent to one US dollar.




When fixed exchange rates ended in 1973, the IMF redefined the SDR as equivalent to the value of a basket of world currencies. The SDR itself is not a currency but an asset that holders can exchange for currency when needed. The SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF and other international organizations.













Who can hold SDRs?


Individuals and private entities cannot hold SDRs. IMF members – and the IMF itself – hold SDRs and the IMF has the authority to approve other holders, such as central banks and multilateral development banks, while individuals and private entities cannot hold SDRs. As of February 2023, there were 20 organizations approved as prescribed holders. Participating members and prescribed holders can buy and sell SDRs. However, prescribed holders do not receive allocations of SDRs, and they may not request an exchange of SDRs in transactions with designation as members do.

 










SDR value





The SDR value in terms of the US dollar is determined daily based on the spot exchange rates observed at around noon London time. It is posted on the IMF website.
The IMF reviews the SDR basket every five years, or earlier if warranted, to ensure that it reflects the relative importance of currencies in the world’s trading and financial systems. In the review concluded in 2015, the IMF’s Executive Board decided that the Chinese renminbi (RMB) met the criteria for inclusion in the SDR basket. In October 2016, the Chinese RMB joined the SDR basket and the three-month yield for China Treasury bonds was added to the basket used to set interest rates on SDRs.
In its reviews, the IMF considers the criteria it uses in selecting SDR basket currencies and the initial currency weights used in determining the amounts (number of units) of each currency in the SDR basket. The currency amounts remain fixed over the five-year SDR valuation period but the weights of currencies in the basket fluctuate with exchange rates among the basket currencies. The value of the SDR is determined daily based on market exchange rates.




A currency included in the SDR basket must meet two criteria:






Quinquennial SDR valuation review





In March 2021, to prioritize its work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IMF Executive Board extended the  SDR valuation basket to July 31, 2022, effectively resetting the five-year cycle of SDR valuation reviews. The review concluded in May 2022 maintained the composition of currencies in the SDR basket and updated their weights (for historical weights see here). The revised basket became effective on August 1, 2022

General allocations of SDRs





The Articles of Agreement allow the IMF to allocate SDRs to members – but not prescribed holders – under certain conditions. There have been four general allocations, most recently in 2021, when the IMF’s Board of Governors approved a general allocation of about SDR 456 billion, equivalent to US$650 billion, to boost global liquidity. The distribution – the largest SDR allocation in the history of the IMF – helped countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The general allocation of about SDR 161 billion in 2009, equivalent to US$250 billion, boosted liquidity amid a global financial crisis. 
A general allocation of SDRs requires broad support from the IMF’s members. The IMF distributes a general allocation to member countries in proportion to their quota shares at the IMF.

Special SDR allocation







The IMF made a special one-time allocation of SDR 21.5 billion (about US$33 billion) in 2009 to make the allocation of SDRs more equitable for countries that joined the IMF after 1981. At the time, those countries – more than one-fifth of the IMF’s members – had never received an SDR allocation.









Does the IMF charge interest?



The SDR interest rate or SDRi provides the basis for calculating the interest rate charged and paid to members, including on regular borrowing from the IMF and on SDR Holdings.
It is determined weekly based on a weighted average of interest rates on three-month debt in the money markets of the SDR basket currencies.

"
What is the Fowlpox virus?,"Fowlpox virus is a viral disease that affects birds, particularly chickens and turkeys. It is a member of the Paramyxovirus family, which includes other viruses such as measles, mumps, and flu.

Symptoms in birds include fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, ruffled feathers, and swelling of the wattles and combs. The disease can be fatal in severe cases.

Fowlpox virus has been known to cause outbreaks in poultry farms and can be spread by infected birds, contaminated equipment, and contaminated feed.

A notable outbreak occurred in the United States in 1999, when an outbreak of fowlpox was detected in a large number of chickens in California. The disease was traced back to a shipment of infected chickens from Mexico, and the outbreak was eventually contained.

In 2015, a similar outbreak occurred in China, where an estimated 25 million chickens were affected. The disease was traced back to a single infected hen, and the outbreak was eventually contained.

Fowlpox virus is not a concern for humans, but can be a significant problem for the poultry industry. The virus can be controlled through vaccination and biosecurity measures, such as proper hygiene and sanitation.",False,https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/fowlpox/fowlpox-in-chickens-and-turkeys,"Fowlpox in Chickens and Turkeys - Poultry - Merck Veterinary Manualhoneypot linkskip to main contentMERCK MANUALVeterinary ManualVETERINARY PROFESSIONALSPET OWNERSRESOURCESQUIZZESABOUTVETERINARY PROFESSIONALSPET OWNERS Veterinary/Poultry/Fowlpox/Fowlpox in Chickens and Turkeys/PROFESSIONAL VERSIONFowlpox in Chickens and TurkeysByDeoki N. Tripathy, DVM, PhD, DACVM, DACPV, Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of
Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignReviewed/Revised Sept 2023 | Modified Sept 2024Fowlpox is a worldwide viral infection of chickens and turkeys. Nodular lesions on unfeathered skin are common in the cutaneous form. In the diphtheritic form, which affects the upper GI and respiratory tracts, lesions occur from the mouth to the esophagus and in the tracheal mucosa. Diagnosis is by observing characteristic gross and microscopic lesions and by PCR assay to detect the fowlpox virus-specific genes. Vaccination can prevent the disease and limit spread in affected flocks.Etiology|Epidemiology|Clinical Findings|Diagnosis|Treatment and Prevention|Zoonotic Risk|Key Points|For More Information|Fowlpox is a slow-spreading viral infection of chickens and turkeys. Fowlpox is an economically important disease of commercial poultry.Etiology of FowlpoxThe etiologic agent of fowlpox is the fowlpox virus, the type virus of the genus Avipoxvirus in the family Poxviridae.Classification of viral genome: Fowlpox virus has a large (~ 300 kb), linear double-stranded DNA genome with a hairpin loop at each end, encoding > 200 genes (including for DNA polymerase, NTPaseI, uracil glycosylase, and thymidine kinase) expressed in different temporal classes: immediate, early, and late.Field strains associated with outbreaks and vaccine strains show differences in their genomic profiles, although the strains can be differentiated to some extent by restriction endonuclease analysis, nucleotide analysis of specific genes, and immunoblotting. Molecular analyses of vaccine and field strains of fowlpox viruses have shown noteworthy differences. Structure: Avipoxviruses have complex, multilayered virions. The brick-shaped capsid measures ~330 × 280 × 200 nm and is enveloped by one or more membranes enclosing a biconcave core that contains the genome in a nucleoprotein complex (see Fowlpox virus lesion).Fowlpox virus lesionImage Courtesy of Dr. Deoki Tripathy.Replication: For entry, the virus binds to glycosaminoglycan receptors on the host cell surface.In common with other poxviruses, fowlpox virus replicates in cytoplasm. Avian poxviruses form extracellular enveloped virus directly by budding of mature virions through the plasma membrane.Pathogenic mechanisms: The large DNA virus present in fowlpox lesions (an in the Poxviridae family) is resistant to normal environment and may survive for extended periods in dried scabs. Photolyase and A-type inclusion body protein genes in the genome of fowlpox virus appear to protect the virus from environmental insults. Avian poxviruses may be sequestered within inclusion bodies. Epidemiology of FowlpoxIncubation period:The incubation period for fowlpox in chickens and turkeys is typically 4–10 days.Morbidity and mortality: Cutaneous infections alone ordinarily cause low or moderate mortality rates, and these flocks generally return to normal production after recovery. Mortality rates are usually high in diphtheritic or systemic infections by some virulent strains.Geographic distribution: Fowlpox is present worldwide. Host range: Fowlpox virus affects mainly chickens and turkeys and has been reported to infect ducks, geese, pheasants, quail, canaries, and hawks. Mammals are not susceptible to natural infection with fowlpox virus or any of other avipoxviruses.Transmission: The virus is usually transmitted by contact through abrasions of the skin.Skin lesions (scabs) shed from recovering birds in poultry houses can become a source of aerosol exposure for susceptible birds. Mosquitoes and other biting insects may serve as mechanical vectors. Transmission within a susceptible flock is rapid when mosquitoes are plentiful. The disease tends to persist for extended periods in multiple-age poultry complexes because of slow spread of the virus and availability of susceptible birds.Clinical Findings of FowlpoxFowlpox occurs in different clinical forms. Fowlpox in chickens and turkeys is characterized by proliferative lesions in the skin that progress to thick scabs (cutaneous form) and by lesions in the upper GI and respiratory tracts (diphtheritic form). Virulent strains may cause lesions in the internal organs (systemic form). The cutaneous form of fowlpox is characterized by nodular lesions on various parts of the unfeathered skin of chickens and on the head and upper neck of turkeys. Generalized lesions of feathered skin may also occur. In some cases, lesions are limited chiefly to the feet and legs. The lesion is initially a raised, blanched, nodular area that enlarges, becomes yellowish, and progresses to a thick, dark scab. Multiple lesions usually develop and often coalesce. Lesions in various stages of development may be found on the same bird. Localization around the nostrils may cause nasal discharge. Cutaneous lesions on the eyelids may cause complete closure of one or both eyes. Only a few birds develop cutaneous lesions at one time. Lesions are prominent in some birds and may substantially decrease flock performance.Scablike lesion, fowlpox, broiler breeder, maleImage Courtesy of Dr. Jean Sander.Scablike lesion, fowlpox, turkeyImage Courtesy of Dr. Jean Sander.Scablike lesion, fowlpox, laying henImage Courtesy of Dr. Jean Sander.In the diphtheritic form of fowlpox, lesions develop on themucous membranes of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, or trachea (wetpox or fowl diphtheria). Occasionally, lesions occur almost exclusively in one or more of these sites.Caseous patches firmly adherent to the mucosa of the larynx and mouth, or proliferative masses may develop. Mouth lesions interfere with feeding. Tracheal lesions cause difficulty in respiration. Laryngeal and tracheal lesions in chickens must be differentiated from those of infectious laryngotracheitis, which is due to a herpesvirus that produces intranuclear inclusions. In cases of systemic infection due to virulent fowlpox virus strains, lesions may be present in internal organs. More than one form of the disease (cutaneous, diphtheritic, or systemic) may occur in a single bird. Often, the course of the disease in a flock is protracted (2–8 weeks). Extensive infection in a layer flock results in decreased egg production. Diagnosis of FowlpoxCharacteristic gross and microscopic lesionsPCR assay for detection of the fowlpox virus-specific genesCutaneous fowlpox infections usually produce characteristic gross and microscopic lesions. When only small cutaneous lesions are present, it is often difficult to distinguish them from abrasions due to fighting.Microscopic examination of affected tissues stained with H&E reveals eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. This is the most commonly used method in diagnostic laboratories. The cytoplasmic inclusions are also detected by fluorescent antibody and immunohistochemical methods (using antibodies against fowlpox virus antigens). The elementary bodies (Borrel bodies) in the inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies) can be detected by light microscopy in smears from lesions stained by the Gimenez method. Viral particles with typical poxvirus morphology can be demonstrated by negative-staining electron microscopy as well as in ultrathin sections of the lesions.The virus can be isolated by inoculating chorioallantoic membrane of developing chicken embryos, susceptible birds, or cell cultures of avian origin. Chicken embryos (9–12 days old) from an SPF flock are the preferred and convenient host for virus isolation.The genomic profiles of field isolates and vaccine strains of fowlpox virus can be compared by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Detailed genetic analysis reveals differences between vaccine strains and field strains responsible for outbreaks of fowlpox in previously vaccinated chicken flocks. Whereas vaccine strains of fowlpox virus contain remnants of long terminal repeats of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), most field strains contain full-length REV in their genome.Although nucleic acid probes derived from cloned genomic fragments of fowlpox virus have been used for differentiation of the diphtheritic form of fowlpox (involving the trachea) from infectious laryngotracheitis, PCR amplification of virus-specific genomic fragments is becoming more convenient where facilities are available.PCR assay has been used effectively to differentiate field and vaccine strains of the virus, whether or not full-length REV is present in those strains that are associated with outbreaks in vaccinated birds. In this regard, DNA isolated from the formalin-fixed tissue sections of birds with histopathologic findings consistent with fowlpox can be used for PCR amplification of genomic fragments using specific primers.Because most outbreaks of fowlpox in previously vaccinated chickens are due to strains with a genome that contains full-length REV, use of REV envelope-specific primers to determine the presence of full-length REV is helpful in such cases.Two monoclonal antibodies that recognized different fowlpox virus antigens were developed. These monoclonal antibodies were useful for strain differentiation by immunoblotting.The complete nucleotide sequences of the genomes of fowlpox virus, canarypox virus, and some other avian poxviruses have been determined. This information is useful for comparing the sequences of selected genes of other avian poxviruses as well as in their phylogenetic analysis.Naturally infected and vaccinated birds develop both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Humoral immune response can be measured by ELISA, agar gel precipitation (AGP), or virus neutralization tests. AGP is a very simple and convenient test; however, its sensitivity is low compared with ELISA.Treatment and Prevention of FowlpoxVaccinationThere is no specific effective treatment for birds infected with fowlpox virus; therefore, prevention is key. Disease control is best accomplished by vaccination.Where fowlpox is prevalent, chickens and turkeys should be vaccinated with a live-embryo- or cell-culture-propagated virus vaccine. The most widely used vaccines are live, attenuated fowlpox virus and pigeonpox virus isolates of high immunogenicity and low pathogenicity. In high-risk areas, vaccination with a live, attenuated virus vaccine of cell-culture origin in the first few weeks after hatching and revaccination at 12–16 weeks old is often sufficient. Health of birds, extent of exposure, and type of operation determine the timing of vaccinations. Because the infection spreads slowly, vaccination is often useful to limit spread in affected flocks if administered when < 20% of the birds have lesions. Passive immunity may interfere with multiplication of vaccine virus; progeny from recently vaccinated or recently infected flocks should be vaccinated only after passive immunity has declined.Vaccinated birds should be examined 1 week later for swelling and scab formation (“take”) at the site of vaccination. Absence of vaccine take indicates lack of potency of vaccine, passive or acquired immunity, or improper vaccination. Revaccination (with another vaccine lot number) may be indicated.Zoonotic Risk of FowlpoxThere is no zoonotic risk associated with fowlpox virus. Avian poxviruses cause a productive infection in avian species but a nonproductive infection in mammalian hosts. Consequently, avian poxviruses have been used as vectors for expression of genes from mammalian pathogens in the development of safe recombinant vaccines.Key PointsFowlpox is a disease of economic importance in chickens and turkeys.Diagnosis is commonly made on the basis of histopathologic findings in infected tissue. Live vaccines are available for prevention.For More InformationTripathy DN, Reed WM. Pox. In: Swayne DE, Boulianne M, Logue CM, et al, eds. Diseases of Poultry. 14th ed.

American television ad campaign


The Man Your Man Could Smell LikeIsaiah Mustafa as ""The Man Your Man Could Smell Like""AgencyWieden+KennedyClientOld SpiceLanguageEnglishRunning time0:33[1]ProductOld Spice body washRelease date(s)February 4, 2010 (2010-02-04) (online)February 8, 2010 (2010-02-08) (television)Directed byTom KuntzStarringIsaiah MustafaProductioncompanyMorton/Jankel/ZanderProduced byDavid ZanderJeff ScrutonScott KaplanCountryUnited States
Smell Like a Man, Man[2] is a television advertising campaign in the United States created by ad agency Wieden+Kennedy for the Old Spice brand of male grooming products, owned by Procter & Gamble. The campaign is commonly referred to as The Man Your Man Could Smell Like, the title of the campaign's initial 30-second commercial. The campaign was launched to market Old Spice's Red Zone After Hours Body Wash, but was subsequently expanded to include other products, following its success. The campaign targets female viewers, despite the product's intended market being male, as the company determined that women frequently make purchasing decisions for hygiene products even for male household members.[3]
The campaign centers on the eponymous ""Man Your Man Could Smell Like"", played by actor Isaiah Mustafa (Old Spice refers to him as ""Old Spice Man"") addressing the viewer in confident, rapid-fire monologues which promote the benefit of using Old Spice products. While reciting the monologues, Mustafa progresses through various activities, locations, costumes, and extraordinary situations, all in one uninterrupted take while maintaining constant eye-contact with the camera in a nonchalant demeanor. The advertisements typically feature a surprise ending.


Background[edit]
As of the early 2000s, Old Spice held position as the market leader in the U.S. for men's deodorant and body wash, with a market share of twenty percent. However, the brand was regarded as unfashionable and largely coasting on an aging reputation.[4][5] Procter & Gamble had sold off several of its other older brands such as Noxzema skin cream, Sure deodorant and Comet cleanser in order to focus on products with potential for faster growth, and Old Spice was on the shortlist for a similar sale if it could not demonstrate further growth.[6]
In 2006, Wieden+Kennedy replaced Saatchi & Saatchi as the advertising agency for the brand. Advertising spending for the account was minimal in the years running up to the handover, with campaigns aimed at holding on to the brand's primary demographic of men over thirty years old. Procter & Gamble completed its acquisition of the Gillette brand of razors and personal care products at around the same time.[7]
The Man Your Man Could Smell Like represented a swing towards humor and lighthearted advertising aimed at a younger demographic. Old Spice took on several celebrity spokespeople popular with younger consumers, such as the actors Neil Patrick Harris and Will Ferrell, and the rap artist LL Cool J.[6]

Commercials[edit]
Initial commercials[edit]
Allen and Kallman confirmed that the commercial was filmed in a single uninterrupted take[3]  requiring three days of shooting and numerous attempts to achieve a successful take. Minimal computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used, consisting of overlaying a separately shot artificial hand during the segment where diamonds flow from Mustafa's palm and the body wash rises through the pile of diamonds with a separately filmed shot of the hand.[3] The remaining effects were practical and achieved on-set, including a crane lifting the bathroom set from above, a crew member dropping a pre-formed shirt over Mustafa's head from above, and a cart that carried Mustafa from the boat set onto the back of a horse.[3][8]
The ad was first broadcast online on 4 February 2010. It debuted on U.S. television four days later during the commercial breaks for new episodes of American Idol and Lost and coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. This delay was timed to take advantage of the predicted increase interest in advertising for the days following Super Bowl XLIV. Its release was widely commented on in the American media, with features appearing in publications such as the Los Angeles Times and the New York Daily News, and Mustafa was invited to appear on several television talk shows, including The Oprah Winfrey Show. The Man Your Man Could Smell Like was a popular, critical, and financial success. By the end of June 2010, it had been viewed online over 11 million times, and had received a number of honors from the advertising and television industries, including the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious award ceremony of the marketing community. At one point in mid-July 2010, videos from the series accounted for eight of the top eleven most-popular videos on YouTube.[9]
Filmed at the same time as the main commercial was a 15-second ""sting""[10] entitled ""Did You Know"", in which the camera zooms out of Mustafa to reveal that he is riding a horse backwards.[10]

""Questions"" and ""Boat""[edit]
The ad expanded upon the first commercial, which featured two changes of location, and only one on camera (the bathroom ""set"" lifting away).[3] In ""Questions"", there were more frequent changes of location with more extravagant transitions. Mustafa begins at a shower station on the beach. The scenery splits in half (as do false legs and a towel) and pulls away to reveal Mustafa log rolling before he walks across the surface of a lake (catching a falling cake mid-stride) into a kitchen (power-sawing a countertop mid-stride) to the top of a waterfall, which he ""swan dives"" off into a hot tub, which then collapses to reveal that Mustafa is sitting on a motorcycle, his shorts having been replaced by jeans. He performs the entire commercial without breaking eye contact with the camera, while addressing female viewers and asking rhetorical questions on what they like, implying that if their man used Old Spice, then he could bring them these things.[11]
The ad was again shot primarily in one take,  involving an automatically rolling log, an under-water platform, and a set consisting of the kitchen, waterfall and hot tub containing water and a motorcycle. The walls of the hot tub were rigged to mechanically rise and lower.  Support wires were used to control Mustafa's dive from the waterfall.  Footage of rehearsals of the ad begin with the log-rolling, suggesting that the opening beach segment may include separately shot or computer-generated elements. The background also appears to be enhanced.[12]

""Scent Vacation""[edit]
Responding to interest in the creation of the previous spots, an official behind-the-scenes video was released for ""Scent Vacation"".[13] It reveals that much of the ad is again produced practically, with some camera tricks.[13] For his dive from the mountaintop, Mustafa was raised on wires as the camera spun to simulate Mustafa's movement. Ultimately, the living room in which Mustafa is shown was built against a vertical wall, and the camera was rotated 90 degrees to make the room appear normally oriented.
Unlike the previous commercials, which were shot outdoors, ""Scent Vacation"" was shot on a soundstage. More computer-generated imagery was used in this commercial than in the prior ads. The sand and sky of the initial beach scene and the entire mountain backdrop were added in post-production; wires were painted out, as were seams where two scenery pieces came together; fish were added to the aquarium; chocolate was added to a fondue fountain in the living room, and a stick of fondue foods was added to Mustafa's hand.
Two 15-second spots were produced, entitled ""Fiji"" and ""Komodo"" after two of the scents in the product line. In ""Fiji"", a beach scene is shown as Mustafa's voice is heard. Mustafa rises from beneath the sand with an acoustic guitar, which he opens to reveal that it contains puppies.
In ""Komodo"", Mustafa appears to stand at the base of a hill atop which sits an ancient palace. The palace is revealed to be a miniature, as Mustafa opens the front wall to reveal the product. He then walks over to a Komodo dragon and pulls open its back to reveal a cooler containing ice cream.
The three spots share a common thread of misleading items containing other items. Aside from the guitar, the palace and the Komodo dragon, in ""Scent Vacation"" Mustafa also picks up a mountain goat, which he spins around to reveal a harp.[14]

Additional materials[edit]
In 2018, Mustafa appeared in one of Tide's Super Bowl LII commercials. The ad was one of several crossovers in which other commercials (including other Procter & Gamble brands' advertising campaigns for Old Spice and Mr. Clean) segued into Tide ads because all of the clothes in them were fresh and clean, including Mustafa's white pants.[15] In 2019, Mustafa appeared in an ad for Hulu that parodied these commercials.

Reception[edit]
The New York Daily News gave the initial ad a favorable mention, citing Mustafa's ""wildly smug, cool-cat smooth dude persona"", which ""helped make the cologne commercial pop"".[16] People magazine's Blane Bachelor called Mustafa's monologue ""sharply scripted"" and his character ""smug, and over the top"".[17] The commercial was a hit on video-sharing websites, such as YouTube, where it had received over 60 million views by February 22, 2022.[1] In June 2010 the ad won the Grand Prix for film at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival,[18] and in July 2010 it won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.[19]
The created feeling of connection between the Old Spice Man and the audience, known as a parasocial relationship,[20] was important to the campaign's success.[21] Overall this combined with the original ad series to become one of the ""most popular viral campaigns in recent history"".[22]

In popular culture[edit]
The spot has been parodied on Sesame Street, where the monster Grover takes Mustafa's role to illustrate the word 'on'.[23] However, his narrations do not go as smoothly: the dropped shirt fails to fall around his neck; the clam containing the tickets bites his nose, forcing him to fling it away; and despite claiming he is on a horse at the end, he is actually on a cow.[24]
There was also a parody released in 2011, close to the release of the film Puss in Boots,[25][26] and in 2019, featuring Mustafa, to advertise Hulu.[27]
It was parodied by How It Should Have Ended for an episode on It Chapter Two, in which the character Mike (who is played by Mustafa in the film) puts his own spin on the commercial's lines.[28]
In 2018, fellow Procter & Gamble brand Tide released a series of Super Bowl advertisements. One commercial featured Mustafa performing part of ""The Man Your Man Could Smell Like"".[29]

What is the Blue Brain Project?,"The Blue Brain Project is a research initiative aimed at reconstructing the architecture of the human brain in high detail. The project is named after the color of the brain, which is blue. The project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and involves researchers from several institutions across Europe.

The Blue Brain Project was founded in 2006 by neuroscientist and computer scientist Bruno Olschowski, and it is directed by neuroscientist and computer scientist Jean-Baptiste Mouret.

The Blue Brain Project aims to create a detailed computer model of the human brain, which will allow researchers to study the brain's structure and function. The project involves using high-speed computing power and advanced algorithms to analyze large amounts of data, such as images and electrical signals from brain cells.

The Blue Brain Project has made several key contributions to the field of neuroscience. For example, the project has developed a detailed model of the mouse brain, which is the first detailed model of a non-human brain. The model has been used to study the function of specific brain regions and to develop new therapies for neurological disorders.

The Blue Brain Project has also made significant progress in developing algorithms for analyzing large amounts of data. The project has developed new algorithms that are able to analyze large amounts of data in real-time, which is essential for studying the brain's structure and function.

The Blue Brain Project has also made several important discoveries. For example, the project has identified new brain regions that are involved in language processing, and it has identified new connections between brain regions that were previously unknown.

The Blue Brain Project has also made several important collaborations with other research groups. For example, the project has collaborated with researchers from the University of California, San Diego, to study the function of specific brain regions in mice.

The Blue Brain Project has also made several important contributions to the field of neuroscience. For example, the project has developed new tools for studying the brain's structure and function, which will allow researchers to study the brain's function in more detail.

Blue Brain Project
The Blue Brain Project was a Swiss National Research Infrastructure project, that ran from 2005 to the end of 2024. Led by Founder and Director Professor Henry Markram, Blue Brain established simulation neuroscience as a complementary approach to understanding the brain alongside experimental, theoretical, and clinical neuroscience.



















EPFL’s Blue Brain Project is a Swiss brain research Initiative led by Founder and Director Professor Henry Markram.
This mission was completed after developing all the main algorithms required to build biologically faithful digital copies of the brain, including; 

Generating the volumes and dimensions of all brain regions,
Populating neurons and glia according to their densities and distributions in each brain region, 
Defining morphological, electrical, and genetic cell types in each brain region, 
Computationally growing the dendrites of an unlimited number of neurons expressing their variety of morphological types in each brain region, 
Modeling an unlimited number of neurons expressing their variety of electrical behaviors, 
Growing all the local, regional and whole brain axons of every type of neuron in the mouse brain
Recreating the connectome down to a neuron to neuron level,
Modeling various types of synapse formed between any two neurons in the brain, 
Simulating neurons, brain regions, brain systems and the whole mouse brain on supercomputers and in the cloud.

The aim of Blue Brain is to establish simulation neuroscience as a complementary approach alongside experimental, theoretical and clinical neuroscience to understanding the brain, by building the world’s first biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain. 
The supercomputer-based simulations and reconstructions built by Blue Brain offer a radically new approach for understanding the multi-level structure and function of the brain.

All the algorithms (which represent over 18 million lines of code), models and data were published in around 300 peer-reviewed papers and were packaged in an open data platform to leverage and continue advancing simulation neuroscience. 

Blue Brain Simulation Neuroscience Platform


From 2025, an independent not-for-profit foundation is launched to support the global community in utilizing simulation neuroscience to study the brain and its diseases. The foundation provides virtual neuroscience labs, enabling users to explore, build, and simulate digital replicas of parts or entire brains, potentially for any species, age, gender, or condition.
Funding
Blue Brain was funded by the Swiss federal government, with oversight provided by the ETH Board and hosting provided by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

"
Who is Alain Badiou?,"Alain Badiou is a French philosopher and political theorist. He was born in Paris on September 25, 1937, and is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the 21st century.

Badiou's academic background includes a degree in philosophy from the University of Paris in 1960 and a doctorate in political science from the University of Paris in 1965. He has held teaching positions at several prestigious universities, including the Sorbonne, the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, and the Collège de France.

Badiou's work is primarily focused on political theory and philosophy, and he has written extensively on subjects such as the concept of truth, the relationship between philosophy and politics, and the nature of the state.

One of Badiou's most famous works is ""Being and Event,"" which was published in 1988. In this book, he argues that the concept of truth is not a matter of objective facts, but rather a question of the relationship between the subject and the object. Badiou also emphasizes the importance of the event, which he defines as a moment of crisis or rupture in the continuity of history.

Badiou has been involved in several political and social movements throughout his career. In the 1980s, he was a leading figure in the French movement for the abolition of the state, which sought to replace the traditional state with a more decentralized and participatory form of governance.

More recently, Badiou has been involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement, which sought to protest against economic inequality and the power of large corporations and financial institutions.

Despite his philosophical and political influence, Badiou is often criticized for his lack of engagement with empirical evidence and his tendency to rely on abstract concepts and arguments. However, his work remains a major force in contemporary philosophy and political theory, and his ideas continue to shape debates and discussions around the world.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Badiou,"

Alain Badiou (/bɑːˈdjuː/;[3] French: [alɛ̃ badju] ⓘ; born 17 January 1937) is a French philosopher, formerly chair of Philosophy at the École normale supérieure (ENS) and founder of the faculty of Philosophy of the Université de Paris VIII with Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Jean-François Lyotard. Badiou's work is heavily informed by philosophical applications of mathematics, in particular set theory and category theory.  Badiou's ""Being and Event"" project considers the concepts of being, truth, event and the subject defined by a rejection of linguistic relativism seen as typical of postwar French thought. Unlike his peers, Badiou openly believes in the idea of universalism and truth.  His work is notable for his widespread applications of various conceptions of indifference.  Badiou has been involved in a number of political organisations, and regularly comments on political events. Badiou argues for a return of communism as a political force.[4]


Biography[edit]
Badiou is the son of the mathematician Raymond Badiou [fr] (1905–1996), who was a working member of the Resistance in France during World War II. Alain Badiou was a student at the Lycée Louis-Le-Grand and then the École Normale Supérieure (1955–1960).[5] In 1960, he wrote his diplôme d'études supérieures [fr] (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Spinoza for Georges Canguilhem (the topic was ""Structures of Demonstration in the First Two Books of Spinoza's Ethics"", ""Structures démonstratives dans les deux premiers livres de l'Éthique de Spinoza"").[6] He taught at the lycée in Reims from 1963 where he became a close friend of fellow playwright (and philosopher) François Regnault,[7] and published two novels before moving first to the faculty of letters of the University of Reims (the collège littéraire universitaire)[8] and then to the University of Paris VIII (Vincennes-Saint Denis) in 1969.[9] Badiou was politically active very early on, and was one of the founding members of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU). The PSU was particularly active in the struggle for the decolonization of Algeria. He wrote his first novel, Almagestes, in 1964. In 1967 he joined a study group organized by Louis Althusser, became increasingly influenced by Jacques Lacan and became a member of the editorial board of Cahiers pour l'Analyse.[9] By then he ""already had a solid grounding in mathematics and logic (along with Lacanian theory)"",[9] and his own two contributions to the pages of Cahiers ""anticipate many of the distinctive concerns of his later philosophy"".[9]
The student uprisings of May 1968 reinforced Badiou's commitment to the far Left, and he participated in increasingly militant groups, such as the Union des communistes de France marxiste-léniniste [fr] (UCFml). To quote Badiou himself, the UCFml is ""the Maoist organization established in late 1969 by Natacha Michel, Sylvain Lazarus, myself and a fair number of young people"".[10] During this time, Badiou joined the faculty of the newly founded University of Paris VIII (Vincennes-Saint Denis) which was a bastion of counter-cultural thought. There he engaged in fierce intellectual debates with fellow professors Gilles Deleuze and Jean-François Lyotard, whose philosophical works he considered unhealthy deviations from the Althusserian program of a scientific Marxism.
In the 1980s, as both Althusserian structural Marxism and Lacanian psychoanalysis went into decline (after Lacan died and Althusser was committed to a psychiatric hospital), Badiou published more technical and abstract philosophical works, such as Théorie du sujet (1982), and his magnum opus, Being and Event (1988). Nonetheless, Badiou has never renounced Althusser or Lacan, and sympathetic references to Marxism and psychoanalysis are not uncommon in his more recent works (most notably Petit panthéon portatif / Pocket Pantheon).[11][12]
He took up his current position at the ENS in 1999. He is also associated with a number of other institutions, such as the Collège International de Philosophie. He was a member of L'Organisation Politique [fr] which, as mentioned above, he founded in 1985 with some comrades from the Maoist UCFml. This organization disbanded in 2007, according to the French Wikipedia article (linked to in the previous sentence). In 2002, he was a co-founder of the Centre International d'Etude de la Philosophie Française Contemporaine, alongside Yves Duroux and his former student Quentin Meillassoux.[13] Badiou has also enjoyed success as a dramatist with plays such as Ahmed le Subtil.
In the last decade, an increasing number of Badiou's works have been translated into English, such as Ethics, Deleuze, Manifesto for Philosophy, Metapolitics, and Being and Event. Short pieces by Badiou have likewise appeared in American and English periodicals, such as Lacanian Ink, New Left Review, Radical Philosophy, Cosmos and History and Parrhesia. Unusually for a contemporary European philosopher his work is increasingly being taken up by militants in countries like India, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa.[citation needed]
In 2014–15, Badiou had the role of Honorary President at The Global Center for Advanced Studies.[14]

Key concepts[edit]
This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (August 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
Badiou makes repeated use of several concepts throughout his philosophy, which he discerns from close readings of the philosophical literature from the classical period. His own method cannot be fully understood if it is not situated within the tradition of French academic philosophy. Badiou's work engages a detailed decrypting of texts, in line with philosophers such as  Foucault, Deleuze, Balibar, Bourdieu, Derrida, Bouveresse and Engel, all of whom he studied with at the Ecole Normale Superieure.
One of the aims of his thought is to show that his categories of truth are useful for any type of philosophical critique. Therefore, he uses them to interrogate art and history as well as ontology and scientific discovery. Johannes Thumfart argues that Badiou's philosophy can be regarded as a contemporary reinterpretation of Platonism.[15]

Conditions[edit]
According to Badiou, philosophy is suspended from four conditions (art, love, politics, and science), each of them fully independent ""truth procedures."" (For Badiou's notion of truth procedures, see below.) Badiou consistently maintains throughout his work (but most systematically in Manifesto for Philosophy) that philosophy must avoid the temptation to suture itself ('sew itself', that is, to hand over its entire intellectual effort) to any of these independent truth procedures. When philosophy does suture itself to one of its conditions (and Badiou argues that the history of philosophy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is primarily a history of sutures), what results is a philosophical ""disaster."" Consequently, philosophy is, according to Badiou, a thinking of the compossibility of the several truth procedures, whether this is undertaken through the investigation of the intersections between distinct truth procedures (the intersection of art and love in the novel, for instance), or whether this is undertaken through the more traditionally philosophical work of addressing categories like truth or the subject (concepts that are, as concepts, external to the individual truth procedures, though they are functionally operative in the truth procedures themselves). For Badiou, when philosophy addresses the four truth procedures in a genuinely philosophical manner, rather than through a suturing abandonment of philosophy as such, it speaks of them with a theoretical terminology that marks its philosophical character: ""inaesthetics"" rather than art; metapolitics rather than politics; ontology rather than science; etc.
Truth, for Badiou, is a specifically philosophical category. While philosophy's several conditions are, on their own terms, ""truth procedures"" (i.e., they produce truths as they are pursued), it is only philosophy that can speak of the several truth procedures as truth procedures. (The lover, for instance, does not think of her love as a question of truth, but simply and rightly as a question of love. Only the philosopher sees in the true lover's love the unfolding of a truth.) Badiou has a very rigorous notion of truth, one that is strongly against the grain of much of contemporary European thought. Badiou at once embraces the traditional modernist notion that truths are genuinely invariant (always and everywhere the case, eternal and unchanging) and the incisively postmodernist notion that truths are constructed through processes. Badiou's theory of truth, exposited throughout his work, accomplishes this strange mixture by uncoupling invariance from self-evidence (such that invariance does not imply self-evidence), as well as by uncoupling constructedness from relativity (such that constructedness does not lead to relativism).
The idea, here, is that a truth's invariance makes it genuinely indiscernible: because a truth is everywhere and always the case, it passes unnoticed unless there is a rupture in the laws of being and appearance, during which the truth in question becomes, but only for a passing moment, discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event, according to a theory originally worked out in Being and Event and fleshed out in important ways in Logics of Worlds. The individual who chances to witness such an event, if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed, can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou, it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a subject; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question, genuine knowledge is produced (knowledge often appears in Badiou's work under the title of the ""veridical""). While such knowledge is produced in the process of being faithful to a truth event, for Badiou, knowledge, in the figure of the encyclopedia, always remains fragile, subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou, truth procedures proceed to infinity, such that faith (fidelity) outstrips knowledge. (Badiou, following both Lacan and Heidegger, distances truth from knowledge.) The dominating ideology of the day, which Badiou terms ""democratic materialism,"" denies the existence of truth and only recognizes ""bodies"" and ""languages."" Badiou proposes a turn towards the ""materialist dialectic,"" which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages, except there are also truths.

Inaesthetic[edit]
In Handbook of Inaesthetics Badiou both draws on the original Greek meaning and the later Kantian concept of  ""aesthesis"" as ""material perception""  and coins the phrase ""inaesthetic"" to refer to a concept of artistic creation that denies ""the reflection/object relation"" yet, at the same time, in reaction against the idea of mimesis, or poetic reflection of ""nature"", he affirms that art is ""immanent"" and ""singular"". Art is immanent in the sense that its truth is given in its immediacy in a given work of art, and singular in that its truth is found in art and art alone – hence reviving the ancient materialist concept of ""aesthesis"". His view of the link between philosophy and art is tied into the motif of pedagogy, which he claims functions so as to ""arrange the forms of knowledge in a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole in them"". He develops these ideas with examples from the prose of Samuel Beckett and the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé and Fernando Pessoa (who he argues has developed a body of work that philosophy is currently incapable of incorporating), among others.

Being and Event[edit]
The major propositions of Badiou's philosophy all find their basis in Being and Event, in which he continues his attempt (which he began in Théorie du sujet) to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology, and in particular post-structuralist and constructivist ontologies.[16] A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits, through its fixation on semiotics and language, any notion of a subject. Badiou's work is, by his own admission,[17] an attempt to break out of contemporary philosophy's fixation upon language, which he sees almost as a straitjacket. This effort leads him, in Being and Event, to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as Mallarmé and Hölderlin and religious thinkers such as Pascal. His philosophy draws upon both 'analytical' and 'continental' traditions. In Badiou's own opinion, this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries, meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up.[18] Being and Event offers an example of this slow uptake, in fact: it was translated into English only in 2005, a full seventeen years after its French publication.
As is implied in the title of the book, two elements mark the thesis of Being and Event: the place of ontology, or 'the science of being qua being' (being in itself), and the place of the event – which is seen as a rupture in being – through which the subject finds realization and reconciliation with truth. This situation of being and the rupture which characterizes the event are thought in terms of set theory, and specifically Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. In short, the event is a truth caused by a hidden ""part"" or set appearing within existence; this part escapes language and known existence, and thus being itself lacks the terms and resources to fully process the event.

Mathematics as ontology[edit]

For Badiou the problem which the Greek tradition of philosophy has faced and never satisfactorily dealt with is that while beings themselves are plural, and thought in terms of multiplicity, being itself is thought to be singular; that is, it is thought in terms of the one. He proposes as the solution to this impasse the following declaration: that the One is not (l'Un n'est pas). This is why Badiou accords set theory (the axioms of which he refers to as the ""ideas of the multiple"") such stature, and refers to mathematics as the very place of ontology: Only set theory allows one to conceive a 'pure doctrine of the multiple'. Set theory does not operate in terms of definite individual elements in groupings but only functions insofar as what belongs to a set is of the same relation as that set (that is, another set too). What individuates a set, therefore, is not an existential positive proposition, but other multiples whose properties (i.e., structural relations) validate its presentation. The structure of being thus secures the regime of the count-as-one. So if one is to think of a set – for instance, the set of people, or humanity – as counting as one, the multiple elements which belong to that set are secured as one consistent concept (humanity), but only in terms of what does not belong to that set. What is crucial for Badiou is that the structural form of the count-as-one, which makes multiplicities thinkable, implies (somehow or other) that the proper name of being does not belong to an element as such (an original 'one'), but rather the void set (written Ø), the set to which nothing (not even the void set itself) belongs. It may help to understand the concept 'count-as-one' if it is associated with the concept of 'terming': a multiple is not one, but it is referred to with 'multiple': one word. To count a set as one is to mention that set. How the being of terms such as 'multiple' does not contradict the non-being of the one can be understood by considering the multiple nature of terminology: for there to be a term without there also being a system of terminology, within which the difference between terms gives context and meaning to any one term, is impossible. 'Terminology' implies precisely difference between terms (thus multiplicity) as the condition for meaning. The idea of a term without meaning is incoherent, the count-as-one is a structural effect or a situational operation; it is not an event of 'truth'. Multiples which are 'composed' or 'consistent' are count-effects. 'Inconsistent multiplicity' [meaning?] is [somehow or other] 'the presentation of presentation.'
Badiou's use of set theory in this manner is not just illustrative or heuristic. Badiou uses the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory to identify the relationship of being to history, Nature, the State, and God. Most significantly this use means that (as with set theory) there is a strict prohibition on self-belonging; a set cannot contain or belong to itself. This results from the axiom of foundation – or the axiom of regularity – which enacts such a prohibition (cf. p. 190 in Being and Event). (This axiom states that every non-empty set A contains an element y that is disjoint from A.) Badiou's philosophy draws two major implications from this prohibition. Firstly, it secures the inexistence of the 'one': there cannot be a grand overarching set, and thus it is fallacious to conceive of a grand cosmos, a whole Nature, or a Being of God. Badiou is therefore – against Georg Cantor, from whom he draws heavily – staunchly atheist. However, secondly, this prohibition prompts him to introduce the event. Because, according to Badiou, the axiom of foundation 'founds' all sets in the void, it ties all being to the historico-social situation of the multiplicities of de-centred sets – thereby effacing the positivity of subjective action, or an entirely 'new' occurrence. And whilst this is acceptable ontologically, it is unacceptable, Badiou holds, philosophically. Set theory mathematics has consequently 'pragmatically abandoned' an area which philosophy cannot. And so, Badiou argues, there is therefore only one possibility remaining: that ontology can say nothing about the event.
Several critics have questioned Badiou's use of mathematics. Mathematician Alan Sokal and physicist Jean Bricmont write that Badiou proposes, with seemingly ""utter seriousness,"" a blending of psychoanalysis, politics and set theory that they contend is preposterous.[19] Similarly, philosopher and aesthetics writer Roger Scruton has questioned Badiou's grasp of the foundation of mathematics, writing in 2012:

There is no evidence that I can find in Being and Event that the author really understands what he is talking about when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.[20]
An example of a critique from a mathematician's point of view is the essay 'Badiou's Number: A Critique of Mathematics as Ontology' by Ricardo L. Nirenberg and David Nirenberg,[21] which takes issue in particular with Badiou's matheme of the Event in Being and Event, which has already been alluded to in respect of the 'axiom of foundation' above. Nirenberg and Nirenberg write:

Rather than being defined in terms of objects previously defined, ex is here defined in terms of itself; you must already have it in order to define it. Set theorists call this a not-well-founded set. This kind of set never appears in mathematics – not least because it produces an unmathematical mise-en-abîme: if we replace ex inside the bracket by its expression as a bracket, we can go on doing this forever – and so can hardly be called ""a matheme.""'
The event and the subject[edit]
Badiou again turns here to mathematics and set theory – Badiou's language of ontology – to study the possibility of an indiscernible element existing extrinsically to the situation of ontology. He employs the strategy of the mathematician Paul J. Cohen, using what are called the conditions of sets. These conditions are thought of in terms of domination, a domination being that which defines a set. (If one takes, in binary language, the set with the condition 'items marked only with ones', any item marked with zero negates the property of the set. The condition which has only ones is thus dominated by any condition which has zeros in it [cf. pp. 367–371 in Being and Event].) Badiou reasons using these conditions that every discernible (nameable or constructible) set is dominated by the conditions which don't possess the property that makes it discernible as a set. (The property 'one' is always dominated by 'not one'.) These sets are, in line with constructible ontology, relative to one's being-in-the-world and one's being in language (where sets and concepts, such as the concept 'humanity', get their names). However, he continues, the dominations themselves are, whilst being relative concepts, not necessarily intrinsic to language and constructible thought; rather one can axiomatically define a domination – in the terms of mathematical ontology – as a set of conditions such that any condition outside the domination is dominated by at least one term inside the domination. One does not necessarily need to refer to constructible language to conceive of a 'set of dominations', which he refers to as the indiscernible set, or the generic set. It is therefore, he continues, possible to think beyond the strictures of the relativistic constructible universe of language, by a process Cohen calls forcing. And he concludes in following that while ontology can mark out a space for an inhabitant of the constructible situation to decide upon the indiscernible, it falls to the subject – about which the ontological situation cannot comment – to nominate this indiscernible, this generic point; and thus nominate, and give name to, the undecidable event. Badiou thereby marks out a philosophy by which to refute the apparent relativism or apoliticism in post-structuralist thought.
Badiou's ultimate ethical maxim is therefore one of: 'decide upon the undecidable'. It is to name the indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject (who, it is important to note, becomes a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a 'generic procedure', which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts the situation in which being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge.
In line with his concept of the event, Badiou maintains, politics is not about politicians, but activism based on the present situation and the evental [sic] (his translators' neologism) rupture. So too does love have this characteristic of becoming anew. Even in science the guesswork that marks the event is prominent. He vigorously rejects the tag of 'decisionist' (the idea that once something is decided it 'becomes true'), but rather argues that the recasting of a truth comes prior to its veracity or verifiability. As he says of Galileo (p. 401):

When Galileo announced the principle of inertia, he was still separated from the truth of the new physics by all the chance encounters that are named in subjects such as Descartes or Newton. How could he, with the names he fabricated and displaced (because they were at hand – 'movement', 'equal proportion', etc.), have supposed the veracity of his principle for the situation to-come that was the establishment of modern science; that is, the supplementation of his situation with the indiscernible and unfinishable part that one has to name 'rational physics'?
While Badiou is keen to reject an equivalence between politics and philosophy, he correlates nonetheless his political activism and skepticism toward the parliamentary-democratic process with his philosophy, based around singular, situated truths, and potential revolutions.

L'Organisation Politique[edit]
Alain Badiou is a founding member (along with Natacha Michel and Sylvain Lazarus) of the militant French political organisation L'Organisation Politique, which was active from 1985 until it disbanded in 2007.[22] It called itself a post-party organization concerned with direct popular intervention in a wide range of issues (including immigration, labor, and housing). In addition to numerous writings and interventions, L'Organisation Politique highlighted the importance of developing political prescriptions concerning undocumented migrants (les sans papiers), stressing that they must be conceived primarily as workers and not immigrants.[23]

Public controversies[edit]
Anti-Semitism accusation and response[edit]
In 2005, a controversy in Parisian intellectual life erupted after the publication of Badiou's Circonstances 3: Portées du mot 'juif' (""The Uses of the Word 'Jew'""). The author criticised Israel's ""identitarian claim to be a Jewish state"" and advocated for a secular Palestine in its place.[24] This book generated a strong response, and the wrangling became a cause célèbre with articles going back and forth in the French newspaper Le Monde and in the cultural journal Les Temps modernes. Linguist and Lacanian philosopher Jean-Claude Milner, a past president of Collège international de philosophie, accused Badiou of anti-Semitism.[25]
Badiou forcefully rebutted this charge, declaring that his accusers often conflate a nation-state with religious preference and will label as anti-Semitic anyone who objects to this tendency: ""It is wholly intolerable to be accused of anti-Semitism by anyone for the sole reason that, from the fact of the extermination, one does not conclude as to the predicate ""Jew"" and its religious and communitarian dimension that it receive some singular valorization – a transcendent annunciation! – nor that Israeli exactions, whose colonial nature is patent and banal, be specially tolerated. I propose that nobody any longer accept, publicly or privately, this type of political blackmail.""[26]
Badiou characterizes the state of Israel as ""neither more nor less impure than all states"", but objects to ""its exclusive identitarian claim to be a Jewish state, and the way it draws incessant privileges from this claim, especially when it comes to trampling underfoot what serves us as international law."" For example, he continues, ""The Islamic states are certainly no more progressive as models than the various versions of the 'Arab nation' were. Everyone agrees, it seems, on the point that the Taliban do not embody the path of modernity for Afghanistan.”[26] A modern democracy, he writes, must count all its residents as citizens, and ""there is no acceptable reason to exempt the state of Israel from that rule. The claim is sometimes made that this state is the only 'democratic' state in the region. But the fact that this state presents itself as a Jewish state is directly contradictory.""[26]
Badiou is optimistic that ongoing political problems can be resolved by de-emphasizing the communitarian religious dimension: ""The signifier 'Palestinian' or 'Arab' should not be glorified any more than is permitted for the signifier 'Jew.' As a result, the legitimate solution to the Middle East conflict is not the dreadful institution of two barbed-wire states. The solution is the creation of a secular and democratic Palestine...which would show that it is perfectly possible to create a place in these lands where, from a political point of view and regardless of the apolitical continuity of customs, there is 'neither Arab nor Jew.' This will undoubtedly demand a regional Mandela.""[26]

Sarkozy pamphlet[edit]
Alain Badiou gained notoriety in 2007 with his pamphlet The Meaning of Sarkozy (De quoi Sarkozy est-il le nom?), which quickly sold 60,000 copies, whereas for 40 years the sales of his books had oscillated between 2,000 and 6,000 copies.[27]

As Rafael Bahr pointed out at the time (in 2009), Badiou despised Sarkozy and barely could write his name. Instead, Badiou usually called Sarkozy ""the Rat Man"" throughout The Meaning of Sarkozy.[28] Steven Poole also pointed out that this characterization (Rat Man) brought charges of antisemitism against Badiou.[29] But as Bahr notes, the controversy went beyond antisemitism, striking at the heart of what it means to be French:“[Badiou] sees Sarkozy as the embodiment of a strain of moral cowardice in French politics, in which the defining moment was the installation of Marshal Pétain as head of the pro-Nazi collaborationist government. For Badiou, Sarkozy is a symbol of ""transcendent Pétainism"".”[28] Mark Fisher was impressed with Badiou’s efforts: “The book treats Sarkozy as an emblem of a particular kind of reactionary politics, and identifies him with an attempt to kill off that which is officially already dead: the emancipatory project that, defiantly, Badiou still calls communism. Badiou claims that Sarkozy’s rise is the return of a kind of ‘Pétainist’ mass subjectivity first instigated by the Vichy regime’s collaboration with the Nazis in World War II; the enemy that is being acquiesced to now, though, is of course capital.”[30]

What is the Heimlich Maneuver?,"The Heimlich maneuver is a medical technique used to dislodge objects that become lodged in a person's airway. It is named after its inventor, Dr. Henry Heimlich, who first described the technique in 1974.

Here are some specific details and examples of the Heimlich maneuver:

* The Heimlich maneuver involves placing one hand on the person's upper back and the other hand on their belly.
* The person's upper back should be pressed firmly in a twisting motion, while their belly should be squeezed firmly in a pumping motion.
* The person's upper back should be pressed and released in a rapid sequence, while their belly should be squeezed and released in a rapid sequence.
* The person's upper back should be pressed and released in a rapid sequence, while their belly should be squeezed and released in a rapid sequence.

Another name for the Heimlich maneuver is abdominal thrusts, because it involves thrusting into the abdominal area. It’s a quick and life-saving method, but you should only use it on conscious people who can’t breathe on their own.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Choking is when a person can’t breathe because food, a toy or another foreign item is blocking their throat or windpipe (trachea). Another name for the Heimlich maneuver is abdominal thrusts. You can use it in different ways on adults and children.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyHow does the Heimlich maneuver work?Dr. Henry Heimlich invented the Heimlich maneuver in 1974. Dr. Heimlich discovered that the remaining air in a person’s lungs could be used to free (dislodge) a foreign object from their esophagus using quick, upward thrusts under their ribcage.At first, the Heimlich maneuver didn’t catch on with the medical community. The backslap method remained the most popular first-aid choking treatment for another 10 years. Eventually, the Heimlich maneuver caught on for use in conscious adults. Healthcare providers still recommend backslaps (back blows) for infants, and they recommend CPR for unconscious adults, children and infants.Procedure DetailsAdults who are choking should receive the standard Heimlich maneuver. For babies, use back blows and upper chest thrusts if the first method doesn’t work.When should you use the Heimlich maneuver?You should use the Heimlich maneuver if a person is conscious and choking. You can usually tell a person is choking if they can’t speak, breathe or cough. Ask the person, “Are you choking?” They may be able to cough but can’t speak to ask for help. Sometimes, their breathing and speaking become weaker and weaker until only gasping sounds come out. People often use the universal choking symbol — holding your hands up and clutching your throat.If a person is able to speak, cough or breathe, don’t attempt the Heimlich maneuver. Encourage the person to keep coughing. Sometimes a strong cough can free the foreign object. Only perform the Heimlich maneuver if a person’s life is in danger.AdvertisementHow do you perform the Heimlich maneuver?To perform the Heimlich maneuver, follow these steps:Stand behind the person and put your arms around their belly (abdomen).Make a fist with one hand and clasp your other hand tightly around it.Place the thumb side of your fist just below their ribcage and about two inches above their belly button (navel).Sharply and quickly thrust your hands inward and upward five times.Repeat this process until you free (dislodge) the object stuck in their windpipe, or the person becomes unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious, start CPR.Can you perform the Heimlich maneuver on toddlers and children?You can perform the Heimlich maneuver on toddlers and children. If the child is younger than 5 years old or weighs less than 45 pounds (20 kilograms), you should alter the method slightly. First, you should kneel behind the child to get down to their level. Then, you should use less forceful thrusts than the typical Heimlich maneuver requires.Can you perform the Heimlich maneuver on babies?Healthcare providers don’t recommend the Heimlich maneuver for use on infants 12 months or younger. Instead, you should use backslaps (back blows) on babies.To perform this method, follow these steps:Turn the infant face down with their chest resting on your forearm or thigh. Make sure their head is lower than their body.Using the heel of your hand, strike the infant between their shoulder blades five times. The strikes should be firm but not so hard that you cause injury.Check the infant’s mouth and remove any visible objects.If their airway remains blocked, turn the infant face up with their head down. Using your second and third fingers, give five inward and upward chest thrusts about ½ to 1½ inches into the infant’s breastbone (sternum).Check the infant’s mouth for visible objects again. Repeat this process until you free (dislodge) the object or the infant becomes unconscious. If the infant becomes unconscious, start CPR.How do you perform the Heimlich maneuver on pregnant women or people with obesity?People who are pregnant or have obesity can receive the Heimlich maneuver in a slightly altered way. Instead of thrusting on their abdomen, you should place the thrusts on their breastbone (sternum).How do you do the Heimlich maneuver on yourself?If you’re alone and choking, you can try to free the item by performing the Heimlich maneuver on yourself.To perform this method, follow these steps:Make a fist with one hand and clasp your other hand tightly around it.Place the thumb side of your fist just below your ribcage and about two inches above your belly button (navel).Sharply and quickly thrust your hands inward and upward five times.Repeat this process until you free (dislodge) the object.You can also try leaning over a railing, chair or table edge. Then, sharply and quickly thrust your upper abdominal area against the edge.Who shouldn’t receive the Heimlich maneuver?Infants shouldn’t receive the Heimlich maneuver. In addition, if a person is unconscious, they shouldn’t receive the Heimlich maneuver. Instead, you should perform CPR.Care at Cleveland ClinicGet Emergency Medicine CareFind an Emergency DepartmentRisks / BenefitsWhat are the risks of the Heimlich maneuver?Healthcare providers consider the Heimlich maneuver a safe and quick method to save lives. You don’t have to have any medical knowledge or training to perform the Heimlich maneuver. But if you don’t perform the Heimlich maneuver correctly, you can do serious harm.AdvertisementIf you aren’t able to dislodge the foreign object after the first few sets of thrusts, problems can occur. The most common complications of the Heimlich maneuver are broken ribs and holes in the gastrointestinal tract. Other rare abdominal complications can happen, but in a life-or-death situation, providers still recommend performing the Heimlich maneuver.Additional Common QuestionsHow can I prevent my child from choking?Young children are at a high risk of choking. To prevent your child from choking:Keep small objects and other hazards out of their reach.Cut their food into small pieces.Be especially careful with round foods, like hot dogs, nuts and grapes.Don’t let them have hard candy.Supervise your child while they’re eating and playing.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhen someone can’t breathe because of a blockage (obstruction) in their upper airway, seconds count. You could save a life by performing the Heimlich maneuver. You don’t have to have any medical training to perform it, but it’s a good idea to know the steps in case the situation ever arises. You may even need to use it on yourself one day. The Heimlich maneuver can be a life-saving rescue technique, but you should only use it if the person can’t breathe and they’re still conscious.AdvertisementMedically ReviewedLast reviewed on 02/13/2024.Learn more about the Health Library and our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementAdvertisementAdQuestions 216.444.2538Appointments & LocationsRequest an AppointmentFind a Primary Care ProviderRendered: Thu Feb 13 2025 23:16:33 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestSnapchatActionsAppointments & AccessAccepted InsuranceEvents CalendarFinancial AssistanceGive to Cleveland ClinicPay Your Bill OnlineRefer a PatientPhone DirectoryVirtual Second OpinionsVirtual VisitsBlog, News & AppsConsult QDHealth EssentialsNewsroomMyClevelandClinicMyChartAbout Cleveland Clinic100 Years of Cleveland ClinicAbout UsLocationsQuality & Patient SafetyPatient ExperienceResearch & InnovationsCommunity CommitmentCareersFor EmployeesResources for Medical ProfessionalsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackSite MapAbout this WebsiteCopyright, Reprint & LicensingWebsite Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination Notice9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2025 Cleveland Clinic.

What is the DALL·E system?,"The DALL·E system is a computer program developed by OpenAI that generates images based on natural language descriptions. It was first introduced in 2021 and has since gained widespread attention and popularity.

The DALL·E system works by analyzing the language used to describe an image, and then generating a new image that matches the description. It uses deep learning algorithms to understand the meaning of the language and generate an image that corresponds to the description.

One of the key features of the DALL·E system is its ability to generate images that are highly realistic and detailed. It can generate images of people, animals, buildings, and other objects, and can even create images that contain multiple elements.

Another important feature of the DALL·E system is its ability to generate images that are highly relevant to a given topic. For example, a user can describe an image of a car and the system will generate an image of a car that is parked in a specific location, at a certain time, and in a specific weather condition.

The DALL·E system has been used by many people and organizations to generate images for a wide range of purposes, including marketing, advertising, and scientific research. It has also been used to create realistic images for use in movies and television shows.

In addition to its ability to generate images, the DALL·E system also has the ability to understand and interpret natural language text. This makes it possible for users to describe an image in their own words and have the system generate a new image that matches their description.

Overall, the DALL·E system is a powerful tool that has the ability to generate images that are highly realistic and detailed. It has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including marketing, advertising, and scientific research.",True,https://openai.com/index/dall-e-2/,"

What is the Denver Developmental Screening Test?,"The Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) is a tool used to screen for developmental delays in young children. It is a standardized test that is designed to identify children who may be at risk for developmental delays or disabilities. The DDST is typically administered by a trained professional, such as a child development specialist or pediatrician, and is designed to assess the child's development in several areas, including:

1. Gross motor skills: The child's ability to move and control their body.
2. Fine motor skills: The child's ability to use small muscles to manipulate objects.
3. Language and communication: The child's ability to understand and use language.
4. Social-emotional development: The child's ability to interact with others and form relationships.
5. Problem-solving and reasoning: The child's ability to think and solve problems.

The DDST is typically administered to children between the ages of 18 and 24 months, and the results are scored and interpreted by a trained professional. The test results can help identify children who may be at risk for developmental delays and provide a baseline for future assessments.

It's important to note that the DDST is just one tool used to screen for developmental delays and that it should be used in conjunction with other assessments and evaluations. Additionally, the DDST is not a diagnostic tool, and it is not meant to diagnose specific conditions or disabilities. It is meant to identify children who may be at risk for developmental delays and provide a baseline for future assessments.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Developmental_Screening_Tests,"

Identifies young children with developmental issues
Medical diagnostic method

Denver Developmental Screening TestsPurposeidentify young children with developmental issues
The Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) was introduced in 1967 to identify young children, up to age six, with developmental problems. A revised version, Denver II, was released in 1992 to provide needed improvements. These screening tests provide information about a range of ages during which normally developing children acquire certain abilities and skills. By comparing a child’s development to the developmental age ranges in this tool, it allows providers to identify young children with developmental problems so that they can be referred for help.
The tests address four domains of child development:  personal-social (for example, waves bye-bye), fine motor and adaptive (puts block in cup), language (combines words), and gross motor (hops). They are meant to be used by medical assistants or other trained workers in programs serving children. Both tests differ from other common developmental screening tests in that the examiner directly tests the child.  This is a strength if parents communicate poorly or are poor observers or reporters.  Other tools, for example the Age and Stages Questionnaires, depend on parent report.
As of 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screening for all children during regular well-child visits at 9, 18, and 30 months of age. The AAP also recommends screening children for autism spectrum disorder during well-child visits at 18 and 24 months of age. However, the AAP does not approve nor endorse any specific tool for screening purposes,[1] but rather endorses the use of any formal, validated screening tool, such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire or others provided by the US Human Health and Services Department.[2]


Denver Developmental Screening Test[edit]
The Denver Developmental Screening Test was developed in Denver, Colorado, by Frankenburg and Dodds and published in 1967.[3] As the first tool used for developmental screening in normal situations like pediatric well-child care, the test became widely known and was used in 54 countries and standardized in 15.[4]
Use of the Denver Developmental Screening Test has raised various concerns: the applicability of 1967 norms in the 1990s and onwards,[5] the difficulty of administering and scoring several of the test’s language items,[6] and the limited validity in cultures that differ from the normative sample in Denver (ethnic groups, varying levels of maternal education, groups with differing genders), potentially leading to under- or over-referrals for mental health services.[7]

Denver II[edit]
Research basis[edit]
The Denver Developmental Screening Test was revised in order to increase its detection of language delays, replace items found difficult to use, and address the other concerns listed.[4]  There are 125 items over the age range from birth to six years. An examiner administers the age-appropriate items to the child, although some can be passed by parental report.  Each item is scored as pass, fail, or refused.  Items that can be completed by 75%-90% of children but are failed are called cautions; items that can be completed by 90% of children but are failed are referred to as delays.   A normal score means no delay in any domain and no more than one caution; a suspect score means one or more delays or two or more cautions; a score of untestable means enough refused items that the score would be suspect if they had been delays. If a child receives a concerning screening score, the next step is an extensive evaluation via medical professionals to identify the developmental disorders. The Denver II is available in various languages.  Videotapes and two manuals describe 14 hours of structured instruction and recommend testing a dozen children for practice.  Beyond this a professional degree is not required.  As with all developmental testing, one must follow the instructions in detail.[8]

Standardization[edit]
The standardization sample of 2,096 children was selected to represent the children of the state of Colorado.  The test has been criticized because that population is slightly different from that of the U.S. as a whole.  However, the authors found no clinically significant differences when results were weighted to reflect the distribution of demographic factors in the whole U.S. population. Globally, other countries have standardized the Denver II to fit their respective populations.[9] Significant differences were defined as differences of more than 10% in the age at which 90% of children could perform any given item.[10]  Separate norms were provided for the 16 items whose scores varied by race, maternal education, or rural-urban residence.[citation needed]

Interpretation[edit]
The author of the test, William K. Frankenburg, likened it to a growth chart of height and weight and encouraged users to consider factors other than test results in working with an individual child.  Such factors could include the parents’ education and opinions, the child’s health, family history, and available services.  Frankenburg did not recommend criteria for referral; rather, he recommended that screening programs and communities review their results and decide whether they are satisfied.[11]
In 2020 the AAP Council on Children with Disabilities; Section on Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics published a list of screening tests for clinicians to consider when selecting a test to use in their practice. This list did not include Denver II among its choices.[12] However, as stated earlier, the AAP does not approve or endorse any specific tool for screening purposes.[1] Rather they advise on how to approach a child with a concerning screening result and provide further work up via medical evaluations to identify the developmental disorders and/or related medical problems.[12] The chairman of the committee wrote: “In the practice of developmental screening and surveillance, we recommend the incorporation of parent-completed questionnaires or directly administered screening tests into the process of surveillance and screening. However, their results should be combined with attention to parental concerns and the pediatrician’s opinion, rather than replacing them, to augment the screening process and increase identification of children with developmental disorders”.[13]

Studies in practice[edit]
One study evaluated the Denver II in terms of how its results matched those of a psychologist in five child-care centers:  two serving the children of college-educated white parents and three serving low-income African-American children.   The psychologist evaluated 104 children, of whom 18 were judged to be delayed [14]). The Denver II yielded a high sensitivity rate, correctly identifying 83% of the previously noted delayed children. However, the screening test also identified more than half of the developmentally normal children as delayed, so its specificity (46%) was low. This study posits that the Denver II was not accurately standardized.
Because the Denver II screening tool was standardized using solely a population of children from Colorado, USA,[14] many other nations attempted to reduce inaccuracy in screening by standardizing the test to its own populations. The DDST-II was adapted for use in Sri Lankan Children after a study was conducted in 2011, standardizing values among 4,251 children between the ages of 0–80 months.[15] Other countries that have conducted studies in order to standardize the DDST to their populations include Singapore,[15] Georgia,[16] and Brazil [17] where it was surveyed to be the most commonly used developmental screening tool nationwide.
Because of the growing number of non-native English speakers in the United States, in 2015, a group of researchers sought to present the utility of translations for the 9 screening tools recommended by the Academy of Pediatrics – Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener, Denver II, Brigance II, CDI, Child Development Review—Parent Questionnaire, IDI, Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status, and the Battelle Developmental Inventory. The Denver II had the largest number of translations (21) with each of them being standardized in the nation of origin for that language. The authors postulate that the Denver II will have greater utility as more children require non-English screening tests.[18]

Global Talent visa: overview

The Global Talent visa is a UK immigration category for talented and promising individuals in specific sectors wishing to work in the UK. It replaced the Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) visa in February 2020.
To be considered for entry under the Global Talent visa, applicants must normally* seek endorsement from one of six endorsing bodies engaged by the UK Home Office. 
If you are applying for endorsement in the fields of science, engineering, medicine, the social sciences or the humanities, or for other academic and research roles, the Home Office will refer your application to the British Academy, Royal Academy of Engineering, Royal Society or UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) which will make an endorsement decision based on the evidence you provide. 
If you are applying for endorsement in non-academic fields of arts and culture and digital technology, your application will be referred to Arts Council England or Tech Nation, which follow separate endorsement criteria. Please see Appendix Global Talent of the Immigration Rules and the guidance on GOV.UK for further information.
If endorsement is granted, the final immigration decision rests with the Home Office.
*Holders of certain prestigious prizes can apply for a visa without going through the initial endorsement stage. The list of eligible awards and further information is available on GOV.UK.
Researchers seeking endorsement for a Global Talent visa
There are four routes for eligible academics and researchers to obtain endorsement for a Global Talent visa: 

Academic and research appointments – fast-track endorsement for individuals who have accepted an eligible position at an approved UK higher education institution or research institute with responsibility either for academic, research or innovation leadership and development, or for directing or leading an individual or team research or innovation project or programme of work. This route is administered by the British Academy, Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society.
Individual fellowships – fast-track endorsement for individuals who have been awarded an individual fellowship on the list approved by the British Academy, Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society. The fellowship must be held currently or within the last five years.
Endorsed funders – fast-track endorsement for researchers and specialists whose name or job title is specified in a successful grant application from an endorsed funder approved by UKRI. In order to be eligible, researchers must be hosted or employed by an eligible institution approved by UKRI.
Peer review – standard endorsement for individuals who submit an application for full peer review by the British Academy, Royal Academy of Engineering or Royal Society.

Our applicant decision tree will help you identify which route may be most appropriate for you. We recommend you read the full guidance for each route before applying.
For the endorsed funders route, UKRI will review applications from any academic or research discipline. For the other three routes, you must select the appropriate endorsing body based on your field of research. 
The British Academy reviews applications from the humanities and social sciences, the Royal Academy of Engineering covers engineering, and the Royal Society covers the natural and medical sciences.
The full list of eligible disciplines and sub-disciplines per endorsing body is available on GOV.UK.
For queries, please see frequently asked questions or email cbrs@royalsociety.org.

What is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002?,"The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) was a comprehensive federal law that aimed to improve corporate governance and financial reporting. SOX was named after its two primary sponsors, Senators Paul Sarbanes and Joseph Biden.

Key provisions of SOX include:

1. Corporate governance reforms: SOX required public companies to establish and follow corporate governance codes, increase the independence of their boards of directors, and improve the nomination process for executive officers.
2. Financial reporting reforms: SOX required public companies to adopt new financial reporting standards, establish internal controls and risk management processes, and ensure that executives and managers are accountable for financial reporting.
3. Increased penalties: SOX increased the penalties for fraud and other financial crimes, including fines and imprisonment.
4. Whistleblower protections: SOX created a whistleblower protection program that allows employees to report fraud or other financial crimes without fear of retaliation.

SOX was enacted in response to several high-profile corporate scandals, including Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco International. These scandals exposed widespread financial fraud and corporate misconduct, and SOX was seen as a necessary response to these issues.

SOX was implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The SEC is responsible for enforcing SOX and ensuring compliance with the law. The PCAOB is responsible for auditing public companies' financial statements and ensuring that they are accurate and reliable.

SOX has had a significant impact on corporate governance and financial reporting. Many companies have adopted corporate governance codes and internal controls to comply with SOX requirements. SOX has also led to increased transparency and accountability in financial reporting, and has helped to prevent future corporate scandals.

However, SOX has also faced criticism for its implementation and enforcement. Some critics argue that SOX has led to increased bureaucracy and cost for public companies, and that it has not been effective in preventing all financial fraud. Despite these criticisms, SOX remains a key piece of federal law that continues to shape corporate governance and financial reporting in the United States.",True,https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763,Just a moment...Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue
What is the Apollo Guidance Computer?,"The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was a computer system developed by NASA for use on the lunar landing missions. The AGC was a central computer system, which was used to control the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) functions of the Apollo spacecraft during lunar landing missions. The AGC was a digital computer system, which was used to process and analyze the data from various sensors and instruments on the spacecraft.

The AGC was designed to be used in real-time, which meant that it had to be able to process and analyze data quickly. The AGC was able to perform complex calculations and computations in a matter of seconds, which was necessary for the precision landing of the spacecraft on the moon. The AGC was also able to communicate with other spacecraft and ground stations, which was necessary for the successful completion of the lunar landing missions.

The AGC was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and was used on all of the Apollo missions that landed on the moon. The AGC was developed in the early 1960s and was replaced by the Apollo Guidance Computer 2 (AGC2) in the early 1970s. The AGC was a significant achievement in the field of computer science and was instrumental in the success of the Apollo missions.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer,"

The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was a digital computer produced for the Apollo program that was installed on board each Apollo command module (CM) and Apollo Lunar Module (LM). The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, and control of the spacecraft.[3] The AGC was the first computer based on silicon integrated circuits.[citation needed] The computer's performance was comparable to the first generation of home computers from the late 1970s, such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and Commodore PET.[4]
The AGC has a 16-bit word length, with 15 data bits and one parity bit. Most of the software on the AGC is stored in a special read-only memory known as core rope memory, fashioned by weaving wires through and around magnetic cores, though a small amount of read/write core memory is available.
Astronauts communicated with the AGC using a numeric display and keyboard called the DSKY (for ""display and keyboard"", pronounced ""DIS-kee""). The AGC and its DSKY user interface were developed in the early 1960s for the Apollo program by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and first flew in 1966.[5]


Operation[edit]
Astronauts manually flew Project Gemini with control sticks, but computers flew most of Project Apollo except briefly during lunar landings.[6] Each Moon flight carried two AGCs, one each in the command module and the Apollo Lunar Module, with the exception of Apollo 7 which was an Earth orbit mission and Apollo 8 which did not need a lunar module for its lunar orbit mission. The AGC in the command module was the center of its guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system. The AGC in the lunar module ran its Apollo PGNCS (primary guidance, navigation and control system), with the acronym pronounced as pings.

Each lunar mission had two additional computers:

The Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) on the Saturn V booster instrumentation ring
the Abort Guidance System (AGS, pronounced ags) of the lunar module, to be used in the event of failure of the LM PGNCS. The AGS could be used to take off from the Moon, and to rendezvous with the command module, but not to land.

The AGC was designed at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory under Charles Stark Draper, with hardware design led by Eldon C. Hall.[2] Early architectural work came from J. H. Laning Jr., Albert Hopkins, Richard Battin, Ramon Alonso,[7][8] and Hugh Blair-Smith.[9]
The flight hardware was fabricated by Raytheon, whose Herb Thaler[10] was also on the architectural team.
According to Kurinec et al, the chips were welded onto the boards rather than soldered as might be expected.[11] Apollo Guidance Computer logic module drawings specify resistance-welding.[12][13]

Logic hardware[edit]
Following the use of integrated circuit (IC) chips in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) in 1963, IC technology was later adopted for the AGC.[14] The Apollo flight computer was the first computer to use silicon IC chips.[15]
While the Block I version used 4,100 ICs, each containing a single three-input NOR gate, the later Block II version (used in the crewed flights) used about 2,800 ICs, mostly dual three-input NOR gates and smaller numbers of expanders and sense amplifiers.[16]: 27, 266  The ICs, from Fairchild Semiconductor, were implemented using resistor–transistor logic (RTL) in a flat-pack. They were connected via wire wrap, and the wiring was then embedded in cast epoxy plastic.[16]: 129 
The use of a single type of IC (the dual NOR3) throughout the AGC avoided problems that plagued another early IC computer design, the Minuteman II guidance computer, which used a mix of diode–transistor logic and diode logic gates.[citation needed] NOR gates are universal logic gates from which any other gate can be made, though at the cost of using more gates.[17]

Memory[edit]
The computer had 2,048 words of erasable magnetic-core memory and 36,864 words of read-only core rope memory.[16]: 27, 90–93  Both had cycle times of 11.72 microseconds.[16]: 27  The memory word length was 16 bits: 15 bits of data and one odd-parity bit. The CPU-internal 16-bit word format was 14 bits of data, one overflow bit, and one sign bit (ones' complement representation).[16]: 35–37 

 DSKY interface[edit]

The user interface to the AGC was the DSKY, standing for display and keyboard and usually pronounced ""DIS-kee"". It has an array of indicator lights, numeric displays, and a calculator-style keyboard. Commands were entered numerically, as two-digit numbers: Verb and Noun. Verb described the type of action to be performed and Noun specified which data were affected by the action specified by the Verb command.
Each digit was displayed via a green (specified as 530 nm[18]) high-voltage electroluminescent seven-segment display; these were driven by electromechanical relays, limiting the update rate. Three five-digit signed numbers could also be displayed in octal or decimal, and were typically used to display vectors such as space craft attitude or a required velocity change (delta-V). Although data was stored internally in metric units, they were displayed as United States customary units. This calculator-style interface was the first of its kind.
The command module has two DSKYs connected to its AGC: one located on the main instrument panel and a second located in the lower equipment bay near a sextant used for aligning the inertial guidance platform. The lunar module had a single DSKY for its AGC. A flight director attitude indicator (FDAI), controlled by the AGC, was located above the DSKY on the commander's console and on the LM.

Timing[edit]
The AGC timing reference came from a 2.048 MHz crystal clock. The clock was divided by two to produce a four-phase 1.024 MHz clock which the AGC used to perform internal operations. The 1.024 MHz clock was also divided by two to produce a 512 kHz signal called the master frequency; this signal was used to synchronize external Apollo spacecraft systems.
The master frequency was further divided through a scaler, first by five using a ring counter to produce a 102.4 kHz signal. This was then divided by two through 17 successive stages called F1 (51.2 kHz) through F17 (0.78125 Hz). The F10 stage (100 Hz) was fed back into the AGC to increment the real-time clock and other involuntary counters using Pinc (discussed below). The F17 stage was used to intermittently run the AGC when it was operating in the standby mode.

Central registers[edit]
The AGC had four 16-bit registers for general computational use, called the central registers:

A: The accumulator, for general computation
Z: The program counter – the address of the next instruction to be executed
Q: The remainder from the DV instruction, and the return address after TC instructions
LP: The lower product after MP instructions
There were also four locations in core memory, at addresses 20–23, dubbed editing locations because whatever was stored there would emerge shifted or rotated by one bit position, except for one that shifted right seven bit positions, to extract one of the seven-bit interpretive op. codes that were packed two to a word. This was common to Block I and Block II AGCs.

Other registers[edit]

The AGC had additional registers that were used internally in the course of operation:

S: 12-bit memory address register, the lower portion of the memory address
Bank/Fbank: 4-bit ROM bank register, to select the 1 kiloword ROM bank when addressing in the fixed-switchable mode
Ebank: 3-bit RAM bank register, to select the 256-word RAM bank when addressing in the erasable-switchable mode
Sbank (super-bank): 1-bit extension to Fbank, required because the last 4 kilowords of the 36-kiloword ROM was not reachable using Fbank alone
SQ: 4-bit sequence register; the current instruction
G: 16-bit memory buffer register, to hold data words moving to and from memory
X: The 'x' input to the adder (the adder was used to perform all 1's complement arithmetic) or the increment to the program counter (Z register)
Y: The other ('y') input to the adder
U: Not really a register, but the output of the adder (the ones' complement sum of the contents of registers X and Y)
B: General-purpose buffer register, also used to pre-fetch the next instruction. At the start of the next instruction, the upper bits of B (containing the next op. code) were copied to SQ, and the lower bits (the address) were copied to S.
C: Not a separate register, but the ones' complement of the B register
IN: Four 16-bit input registers
OUT: Five 16-bit output registers
Instruction set[edit]
The instruction format used 3 bits for opcode, and 12 bits for address. Block I had 11 instructions: TC, CCS, INDEX, XCH, CS, TS, AD, and MASK (basic), and SU, MP, and DV (extra). The first eight, called basic instructions, were directly accessed by the 3-bit op. code. The final three were denoted as extracode instructions because they were accessed by performing a special type of TC instruction (called EXTEND) immediately before the instruction.
The Block I AGC instructions consisted of the following:

TC (transfer control)
An unconditional branch to the address specified by the instruction. The return address was automatically stored in the Q register, so the TC instruction could be used for subroutine calls.
CCS (count, compare, and skip)
A complex conditional branch instruction. The A register was loaded with data retrieved from the address specified by the instruction. (Because the AGC uses ones' complement notation, there are two representations of zero. When all bits are set to zero, this is called plus zero. If all bits are set to one, this is called minus zero.) The diminished absolute value (DABS) of the data was then computed and stored in the A register. If the number was greater than zero, the DABS decrements the value by 1; if the number was negative, it is complemented before the decrement is applied—this is the absolute value. Diminished means ""decremented but not below zero"". Therefore, when the AGC performs the DABS function, positive numbers will head toward plus zero, and so will negative numbers but first revealing their negativity via the four-way skip below. The final step in CCS is a four-way skip, depending upon the data in register A before the DABS. If register A was greater than 0, CCS skips to the first instruction immediately after CCS. If register A contained plus zero, CCS skips to the second instruction after CCS. Less than zero causes a skip to the third instruction after CCS, and minus zero skips to the fourth instruction after CCS. The primary purpose of the count was to allow an ordinary loop, controlled by a positive counter, to end in a CCS and a TC to the beginning of the loop, equivalent to an IBM 360's BCT. The absolute value function was deemed important enough to be built into this instruction; when used for only this purpose, the sequence after the CCS was TC *+2, TC *+2, AD ONE. A curious side effect was the creation and use of CCS-holes when the value being tested was known to be never positive, which occurred more often than one might suppose. That left two whole words unoccupied, and a special committee was responsible for assigning data constants to these holes.
INDEX
Add the data retrieved at the address specified by the instruction to the next instruction. INDEX can be used to add or subtract an index value to the base address specified by the operand of the instruction that follows INDEX. This method is used to implement arrays and table look-ups; since the addition was done on both whole words, it was also used to modify the op. code in a following (extracode) instruction, and on rare occasions both functions at once.
RESUME
A special instance of INDEX (INDEX 25). This is the instruction used to return from interrupts. It causes execution to resume at the interrupted location.
XCH (exchange)
Exchange the contents of memory with the contents of the A register. If the specified memory address is in fixed (read-only) memory, the memory contents are not affected, and this instruction simply loads register A. If it is in erasable memory, overflow ""correction"" is achieved by storing the leftmost of the 16 bits in A as the sign bit in memory, but there is no exceptional behavior like that of TS.
CS (clear and subtract)
Load register A with the ones' complement of the data referenced by the specified memory address.
TS (transfer to storage)
Store register A at the specified memory address. TS also detects, and corrects for, overflows in such a way as to propagate a carry for multi-precision add/subtract. If the result has no overflow (leftmost 2 bits of A the same), nothing special happens; if there is overflow (those 2 bits differ), the leftmost one goes the memory as the sign bit, register A is changed to +1 or −1 accordingly, and control skips to the second instruction following the TS. Whenever overflow is a possible but abnormal event, the TS was followed by a TC to the no-overflow logic; when it is a normal possibility (as in multi-precision add/subtract), the TS is followed by CAF ZERO (CAF = XCH to fixed memory) to complete the formation of the carry (+1, 0, or −1) into the next higher-precision word. Angles were kept in single precision, distances and velocities in double precision, and elapsed time in triple precision.
AD (add)
Add the contents of memory to register A and store the result in A. The 2 leftmost bits of A may be different (overflow state) before and/or after the AD. The fact that overflow is a state rather than an event forgives limited extents of overflow when adding more than two numbers, as long as none of the intermediate totals exceed twice the capacity of a word.
MASK
Perform a bit-wise (boolean) and of memory with register A and store the result in register A.
MP (multiply)
Multiply the contents of register A by the data at the referenced memory address and store the high-order product in register A and the low-order product in register LP. The parts of the product agree in sign.
DV (divide)
Divide the contents of register A by the data at the referenced memory address. Store the quotient in register A and the absolute value of the remainder in register Q. Unlike modern machines, fixed-point numbers were treated as fractions (notional decimal point just to right of the sign bit), so you could produce garbage if the divisor was not larger than the dividend; there was no protection against that situation. In the Block II AGC, a double-precision dividend started in A and L (the Block II LP), and the correctly signed remainder was delivered in L. That considerably simplified the subroutine for double precision division.
SU (subtract)
Subtract (ones' complement) the data at the referenced memory address from the contents of register A and store the result in A.
Instructions were implemented in groups of 12 steps, called timing pulses. The timing pulses were named TP1 through TP12. Each set of 12 timing pulses was called an instruction subsequence. Simple instructions, such as TC, executed in a single subsequence of 12 pulses. More complex instructions required several subsequences. The multiply instruction (MP) used 8 subsequences: an initial one called MP0, followed by an MP1 subsequence which was repeated 6 times, and then terminated by an MP3 subsequence. This was reduced to 3 subsequences in Block II.
Each timing pulse in a subsequence could trigger up to 5 control pulses. The control pulses were the signals which did the actual work of the instruction, such as reading the contents of a register onto the bus, or writing data from the bus into a register.

Memory[edit]
AGC core rope memory (ROM)
Block I AGC memory was organized into 1 kiloword banks. The lowest bank (bank 0) was erasable memory (RAM). All banks above bank 0 were fixed memory (ROM). Each AGC instruction had a 12-bit address field. The lower bits (1-10) addressed the memory inside each bank. Bits 11 and 12 selected the bank: 00 selected the erasable memory bank; 01 selected the lowest bank (bank 1) of fixed memory; 10 selected the next one (bank 2); and 11 selected the Bank register that could be used to select any bank above 2. Banks 1 and 2 were called fixed-fixed memory, because they were always available, regardless of the contents of the Bank register. Banks 3 and above were called fixed-switchable because the selected bank was determined by the bank register.
The Block I AGC initially had 12 kilowords of fixed memory, but this was later increased to 24 kilowords. Block II had 36 kilowords of fixed memory and 2 kilowords of erasable memory.
The AGC transferred data to and from memory through the G register in a process called the memory cycle. The memory cycle took 12 timing pulses (11.72 μs). The cycle began at timing pulse 1 (TP1) when the AGC loaded the memory address to be fetched into the S register. The memory hardware retrieved the data word from memory at the address specified by the S register. Words from erasable memory were deposited into the G register by timing pulse 6 (TP6); words from fixed memory were available by timing pulse 7. The retrieved memory word was then available in the G register for AGC access during timing pulses 7 through 10. After timing pulse 10, the data in the G register was written back to memory.
The AGC memory cycle occurred continuously during AGC operation. Instructions needing memory data had to access it during timing pulses 7–10. If the AGC changed the memory word in the G register, the changed word was written back to memory after timing pulse 10. In this way, data words cycled continuously from memory to the G register and then back again to memory.
The lower 15 bits of each memory word held AGC instructions or data, with each word being protected by a 16th odd parity bit. This bit was set to 1 or 0 by a parity generator circuit so a count of the 1s in each memory word would always produce an odd number. A parity checking circuit tested the parity bit during each memory cycle; if the bit didn't match the expected value, the memory word was assumed to be corrupted and a parity alarm panel light was illuminated.

Interrupts and involuntary counters[edit]
The AGC had five vectored interrupts:

Dsrupt was triggered at regular intervals to update the user display (DSKY).
Erupt was generated by various hardware failures or alarms.
Keyrupt signaled a key press from the user's keyboard.
T3Rrupt was generated at regular intervals from a hardware timer to update the AGC's real-time clock.
Uprupt was generated each time a 16-bit word of uplink data was loaded into the AGC.
The AGC responded to each interrupt by temporarily suspending the current program, executing a short interrupt service routine, and then resuming the interrupted program.
The AGC also had 20 involuntary counters. These were memory locations which functioned as up/down counters, or shift registers. The counters would increment, decrement, or shift in response to internal inputs. The increment (Pinc), decrement (Minc), or shift (Shinc) was handled by one subsequence of microinstructions inserted between any two regular instructions.
Interrupts could be triggered when the counters overflowed. The T3rupt and Dsrupt interrupts were produced when their counters, driven by a 100 Hz hardware clock, overflowed after executing many Pinc subsequences. The Uprupt interrupt was triggered after its counter, executing the Shinc subsequence, had shifted 16 bits of uplink data into the AGC.

Standby mode[edit]
The AGC had a power-saving mode controlled by a standby allowed switch. This mode turned off the AGC power, except for the 2.048 MHz clock and the scaler. The F17 signal from the scaler turned the AGC power and the AGC back on at 1.28 second intervals. In this mode, the AGC performed essential functions, checked the standby allowed switch, and, if still enabled, turned off the power and went back to sleep until the next F17 signal.
In the standby mode, the AGC slept most of the time; therefore it was not awake to perform the Pinc instruction needed to update the AGC's real time clock at 10 ms intervals. To compensate, one of the functions performed by the AGC each time it awoke in the standby mode was to update the real time clock by 1.28 seconds.
The standby mode was designed to reduce power by 5 to 10 W (from 70 W) during midcourse flight when the AGC was not needed. However, in practice, the AGC was left on during all phases of the mission and this feature was never used.

Data buses[edit]
The AGC had a 16-bit read bus and a 16-bit write bus. Data from central registers (A, Q, Z, or LP), or other internal registers could be gated onto the read bus with a control signal. The read bus connected to the write bus through a non-inverting buffer, so any data appearing on the read bus also appeared on the write bus. Other control signals could copy write bus data back into the registers.
Data transfers worked like this: To move the address of the next instruction from the B register to the S register, an RB (read B) control signal was issued; this caused the address to move from register B to the read bus, and then to the write bus. A WS (write S) control signal moved the address from the write bus into the S register.
Several registers could be read onto the read bus simultaneously. When this occurred, data from each register was inclusive-ORed onto the bus. This inclusive-OR feature was used to implement the Mask instruction, which was a logical AND operation. Because the AGC had no native ability to do a logical AND, but could do a logical OR through the bus and could complement (invert) data through the C register, De Morgan's theorem was used to implement the equivalent of a logical AND. This was accomplished by inverting both operands, performing a logical OR through the bus, and then inverting the result.

Software[edit]
Margaret Hamilton standing next to listings of the software she and her MIT team produced for the Apollo Project.[19]
AGC software was written in AGC assembly language and stored on rope memory. The bulk of the software was on read-only rope memory and thus could not be changed in operation,[20] but some key parts of the software were stored in standard read-write magnetic-core memory and could be overwritten by the astronauts using the DSKY interface, as was done on Apollo 14.
A simple real-time operating system designed by J. Halcombe Laning[21] consisting of the 'Exec', a batch job-scheduling using cooperative multi-tasking,[22] and an interrupt-driven pre-emptive scheduler called the 'Waitlist' which scheduled timer-driven 'tasks', controlled the computer. Tasks were short threads of execution which could reschedule themselves for re-execution on the Waitlist, or could kick off a longer operation by starting a 'job' with the Exec. Calculations were carried out using the metric system, but display readouts were in units of feet, feet per second, and nautical miles – units that the Apollo astronauts were accustomed to.[23]
The AGC  had a sophisticated software interpreter, developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, that implemented a virtual machine with more complex and capable pseudo-instructions than the native AGC. These instructions simplified the navigational programs. Interpreted code, which featured double precision trigonometric, scalar and vector arithmetic (16 and 24-bit), even an MXV (matrix × vector) instruction, could be mixed with native AGC code. While the execution time of the pseudo-instructions was increased (due to the need to interpret these instructions at runtime) the interpreter provided many more instructions than AGC natively supported and the memory requirements were much lower than in the case of adding these instructions to the AGC native language which would require additional memory built into the computer (in the 1960s memory was very expensive). The average pseudo-instruction required about 24 ms to execute. The assembler, named YUL for an early prototype Christmas Computer,[24] enforced proper transitions between native and interpreted code.
A set of interrupt-driven user interface routines called 'Pinball' provided keyboard and display services for the jobs and tasks running on the AGC. A set of user-accessible routines were provided to let the astronauts display the contents of various memory locations in octal or decimal in groups of 1, 2, or 3 registers at a time. 'Monitor' routines were provided so the operator could initiate a task to periodically redisplay the contents of certain memory locations. Jobs could be initiated.
The design principles developed for the AGC by MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, directed in late 1960s by Charles Draper, became foundational to software engineering—particularly for the design of more reliable systems that relied on asynchronous software, priority scheduling, testing, and human-in-the-loop decision capability.[25] When the design requirements for the AGC were defined, necessary software and programming techniques did not exist so they had to be designed from scratch. Many of the trajectory and guidance algorithms used were based on earlier work by Richard Battin.[21] The first command module flight was controlled by a software package called CORONA whose development was led by Alex Kosmala. Software for lunar missions consisted of COLOSSUS for the command module, whose development was led by Frederic Martin, and LUMINARY[26] on the lunar module led by George Cherry. Details of these programs were implemented by a team under the direction of Margaret Hamilton.[27] Hamilton was very interested in how the astronauts would interact with the software and predicted the types of errors that could occur due to human error.[22][27] In total, software development on the project comprised 1400 person-years of effort, with a peak workforce of 350 people.[21] In 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her role in creating the flight software.
The Apollo Guidance Computer software influenced the design of Skylab, Space Shuttle and early fly-by-wire fighter aircraft systems.[28][29]
The Apollo Guidance computer has been called ""The fourth astronaut"" for its role in helping the three astronauts who relied on it: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.[30]

Block II[edit]
A Block II version of the AGC was designed in 1966. It retained the basic Block I architecture, but increased erasable memory from 1 to 2 kilowords. Fixed memory was expanded from 24 to 36 kilowords. Instructions were expanded from 11 to 34 and I/O channels were implemented to replace the I/O registers on Block I. The Block II version is the one that actually flew to the moon. Block I was used during the uncrewed Apollo 4 and 6 flights, and was on board the ill-fated Apollo 1.
The decision to expand the memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I's restrictive three-bit op. code and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to squeeze in additional instructions, such as having special memory addresses which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an INDEX to address 25 triggered the RESUME instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, INDEX 17 performed an INHINT instruction (inhibit interrupts), while INDEX 16 reenabled them (RELINT). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of TC called EXTEND. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (erasable) registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed at any given time was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the erasable memory. In addition, the bank register could address a maximum of 32 kilowords, so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 kilowords. All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.
The Block II AGC also has the EDRUPT instruction (the name is a contraction of Ed's Interrupt, after Ed Smally, the programmer who requested it). This instruction does not generate an interrupt, rather it performs two actions that are common to interrupt processing. The first action, inhibits further interrupts (and requires a RESUME instruction to enable them again). In the second action, the ZRUPT register is loaded with the current value of the program counter (Z). It was only used once in the Apollo software, for setting up the DAP cycle termination sequence in the Digital Autopilot of the lunar module.[31] It is believed to be responsible for problems emulating the LEM AGC Luminary software.

1201 and 1202 program alarms[edit]
DSKY and Buzz Aldrin on the Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle en route to the Moon
PGNCS generated unanticipated warnings during Apollo 11's lunar descent, with the AGC showing a 1202 alarm (""Executive overflow - NO CORE SETS""),[32] and then a 1201 alarm (""Executive overflow - NO VAC AREAS"").[33] The response of the AGC to either alarm was a soft restart. The cause was a rapid, steady stream of spurious cycle steals from the rendezvous radar (tracking the orbiting command module), intentionally left on standby during the descent in case it was needed for an abort.[34][35]
During this part of the approach, the processor would normally be almost 85% loaded. The extra 6,400 cycle steals per second added the equivalent of 13% load, leaving just enough time for all scheduled tasks to run to completion. Five minutes into the descent, Buzz Aldrin gave the computer the command 1668, which instructed it to periodically calculate and display DELTAH (the difference between altitude sensed by the radar and the computed altitude).[nb 1] The 1668 added another 10% to the processor workload, causing executive overflow and a 1202 alarm. After being given the ""GO"" from Houston, Aldrin entered 1668 again and another 1202 alarm occurred. When reporting the second alarm, Aldrin added the comment ""It appears to come up when we have a 1668 up"". The AGC software had been designed with priority scheduling, and automatically recovered, deleting lower priority tasks including the 1668 display task, to complete its critical guidance and control tasks. Guidance controller Steve Bales and his support team that included Jack Garman issued several ""GO"" calls and the landing was successful.[36]
The problem was not a programming error in the AGC, nor was it pilot error. It was a peripheral hardware design bug that had already been known and documented by Apollo 5 engineers.[37] However, because the problem had only occurred once during testing, they concluded that it was safer to fly with the existing hardware that they had already tested, than to fly with a newer but largely untested radar system. In the actual hardware, the position of the rendezvous radar was encoded with synchros excited by a different source of 800 Hz AC than the one used by the computer as a timing reference. The two 800 Hz sources were frequency locked but not phase locked, and the small random phase variations made it appear as though the antenna was rapidly ""dithering"" in position, even though it was completely stationary. These phantom movements generated the rapid series of cycle steals.
J. Halcombe Laning's software and computer design saved the Apollo 11 landing mission.  Had it not been for Laning's design, the landing would have been aborted for lack of a stable guidance computer.[37][38]

Applications outside Apollo[edit]
Fly By Wire testbed aircraft. The AGC DSKY is visible in the avionics bay
The AGC formed the basis of an experimental fly-by-wire (FBW) system installed into an F-8 Crusader to demonstrate the practicality of computer driven FBW. The AGC used in the first phase of the program was replaced with another machine in the second phase, and research done on the program led to the development of fly-by-wire systems for the Space Shuttle. The AGC also led, albeit indirectly, to the development of fly-by-wire systems for the generation of fighters that were being developed at the time.[39]

Source code release[edit]
In 2003, Ron Burkey initiated the Virtual AGC Project, aiming to recover the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) source code and build a functional emulator.[40][41] As part of this project, the original code, transcribed and digitized from 1960s hard copies,[42] was made available through the Virtual AGC Project and MIT Museum.[43] This effort gained renewed attention in mid-2016 when former NASA intern Chris Garry uploaded the code to GitHub, generating significant media attention.[44][45][46]

Notes[edit]


^ More specifically, verb 16 instructs the AGC to print the noun (in this case, 68, DELTAH) approximately twice per second.  Had Aldrin known this, a simple 0668 (calculate and display DELTAH, once) would have only added approximately 5% load to the system, and would have only done so once, when ENTER was pressed.

"
What is the Habitat 67 complex?,"Habitat 67 is a complex of 18 residential towers in Montreal, Canada, designed by Moshe Safdie. It is a unique and iconic structure that stands out as a landmark in the city's skyline.

The complex was built in 1967 and consists of 18 identical towers, each with 16 floors. The towers have a total of 224 residential units, ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The towers are arranged in a circular shape, with the central core containing elevators and stairs.

The name ""Habitat 67"" refers to the United Nations' International Year of Peace and Social Progress, which was held in 1967. The complex was built to showcase new ideas in sustainable architecture and to promote social housing for Montreal's rapidly growing population.

The design of Habitat 67 was inspired by the concept of a city within a city, with the towers arranged in a circular shape to maximize the use of space and natural light. The towers are made of reinforced concrete and feature large windows that allow for natural light and ventilation.

The complex also includes a swimming pool, a fitness center, and a community center. The towers are connected by a series of walkways and stairs, creating a vibrant and active community.

Habitat 67 was designed to be environmentally sustainable, with the use of natural materials and a passive solar design that minimizes energy consumption. The complex also features a green roof that helps to reduce stormwater runoff and provides habitat for local wildlife.

Habitat 67 has become a landmark in Montreal's skyline and is recognized as a significant achievement in sustainable and social housing. It has been featured in numerous films and documentaries and has been a source of inspiration for architects and urban planners around the world.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_67,"

Habitat 67, as seen from street level
Habitat 67, or simply Habitat, is a housing complex at Cité du Havre, on the Saint Lawrence River, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, designed by Israeli-Canadian-American architect Moshe Safdie. It originated in his master's thesis at the School of Architecture at McGill University and then an amended version was built for Expo 67, a World's Fair held from April to October 1967. Its address is 2600 Avenue Pierre-Dupuy, next to the Marc-Drouin Quay. Habitat 67 is considered an architectural landmark and a recognized building in Montreal.[1][2][3][4]


History[edit]
Inside the complex: a semi-covered walkway connecting two sections of units
Safdie's design for Habitat 67 began as a thesis project for his architecture program at McGill University. It was ""highly recognized"" at the institution, though Safdie cites its failure to win the Pilkington Prize, an award for the best thesis at Canadian schools of architecture, as early evidence of its controversial nature.[5] After leaving to work with Louis Kahn in Philadelphia, Safdie was approached by Sandy van Ginkel, his former thesis advisor, to develop the master plan for Expo 67, the world's fair that was set to take place in Montreal during 1967. Safdie decided to propose his thesis as one of the pavilions and began developing his plan.[5] After the plans were approved in Ottawa by Mitchell Sharp, the federal cabinet minister responsible for the exhibition, and Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, Safdie was given the blessing of the Expo 67 Director of Installations, Edward Churchill, to leave the planning committee in order to work on the building project as an independent architect.[5] The construction was done by Anglin-Norcross Ltd. of Montreal.[6] Safdie was awarded the project in spite of his relative youth and inexperience, an opportunity he later described as ""a fairy tale, an amazing fairy tale.""[5]
The original plans called for 1,200 homes at a cost of $45 million.[7] However, Safdie could only secure funding for a much reduced construction. This smaller development (about CA$22.4 million)[8][9] was financed by the federal government, but is now owned by its tenants, who formed a limited partnership that purchased the building from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation in 1985.

Habitat 67's interlocking forms, connected walkways and landscaped terraces were key in achieving Safdie's goal of a private and natural environment within the limits of a dense urban space.
Concept and design[edit]
Habitat 67 comprises 354 identical,[9] prefabricated concrete forms (11.7 m × 5.3 m × 3 m [38 ft 5 in × 17 ft 5 in × 9 ft 10 in])[9] arranged in various combinations, divided into three pyramids,[10][9] reaching up to 12 residential storeys, with a parking level, and a building services level. Together these units created 146 residences of varying sizes and configurations, each formed from one to eight linked concrete units.[11] The complex originally contained 158 apartments,[12] reduced from the original vision of 1,200,[7] but several apartments have since been joined to create larger units, reducing the total number. Each unit is connected to at least one private landscaped garden terrace,[9] built on the roof of the level below,[11][9] which can range from approximately 20 to 90 square metres (225 to 1,000 sq ft) in size.[11][13] The apartments each had a moulded plastic bathroom and a modular kitchen.[9]
The development was designed to integrate the benefits of suburban homes—namely gardens, fresh air, privacy, and multilevelled environments—with the economics and density of a modern urban apartment building.[2] It was believed to illustrate the new lifestyle people would live in increasingly crowded cities around the world.[14] Safdie's goal for the project to be affordable housing largely failed: demand for the building's units has made them more expensive than originally envisioned.[2] In addition, the existing structure was originally meant to only be the first phase of a much larger complex, but the high per-unit cost of approximately $140,000 ($22,120,000 for all 158) prevented that possibility.[15][clarification needed]
The structural engineer for the project was August Eduard Komendant, an Estonian-American structural engineer and a pioneer in the field of prestressed concrete.[16]

Habitat 67, southwest view
The theme of Expo 67 was ""Man and His World"", taken from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's memoir Terre des hommes (literally, 'world of man', though it was published under the title Wind, Sand and Stars).[17] Housing was also one of the main themes of Expo 67. Habitat 67 then became a thematic pavilion visited by thousands of visitors who came from around the world, and during the expo also served as the temporary residence of the many dignitaries visiting Montreal.
In March 2012, Habitat 67 won an online Lego Architecture poll and is a candidate to be added to the list of famous buildings that inspire a special replica Lego set. Lego bricks were actually used in the initial planning for Habitat; according to Safdie's firm, ""initial models of the project were built using Lego bricks and subsequent iterations were also built with Lego bricks"".[18]

Access[edit]
Residents have private shuttle access to downtown Montreal, but access by foot is difficult.[19] Guided tours are offered to the public.[20]
In 2023, the extension of the 777 Casino bus route of the Société de transport de Montréal began serving Habitat 67, providing the complex with public transport access for the first time. [21]

Legacy[edit]
In 2017, Canada Post issued a commemorative stamp for the 50th anniversary of Expo 67 featuring the structure.[22]
In 2017, from June 1 through August 13, Habitat '67 vers l'avenir / The Shape of Things to Come,[23] an exhibition at Centre de Design, Université du Québec à Montréal, presented ""archival images and objects from the project's origins with conceptual drawings, and models, bringing them together with plans for unbuilt iterations"".[23]
As a symbol[24] of Expo 67, which was attended by over 50 million people during the six months it was open, Habitat 67 gained worldwide acclaim as a ""fantastic experiment""[25] and ""architectural wonder"".[3] This experiment was and is regarded as both a success and failure—it ""redefined urban living""[26] and has since become ""a very successful co-op"",[2] but at the same time ultimately failed to revolutionize affordable housing or launch a wave of prefabricated, modular development as Safdie had envisioned.[2] Despite its problems, however, Habitat's fame and success ""made [Safdie's] reputation""[24] and helped launch his career; Safdie has now designed over 75 buildings and master plans around the world.[26] Decades after Habitat, much of Safdie's work still holds to the concepts that were so fundamental to its design, especially the themes of reimagining high-density housing and improving social integration through architecture that have become ""synonymous"" with his work.[27] However, The Guardian quoted[28] The Walrus assessment of it as a ""failed dream"".[25]
In 2023, Safdie Architects, in collaboration with Epic Games, modeled the entirety of the original (much larger) vision in Unreal Engine.[7]

In popular culture[edit]
The music video for Leonard Cohen's song ""In My Secret Life"" was filmed at Habitat 67, as were scenes of the 1977 film The Disapperance.
It appears on the covers of the 2003 album Velocity : Design : Comfort by American electronic/experimental rock act Sweet Trip and the 2012 album The North by Canadian indie pop band Stars. It also appears on the album cover of Landslide's Drum & Bossa / Buddah, his debut single from 1999 that was released on Hospital Records.

"
What is the Golden Temple of Amritsar?,"The Golden Temple, also known as the Harmandir Sahib, is a Sikh holy site located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is considered to be the holiest place in Sikhism and is a major pilgrimage site for Sikhs around the world.

The Golden Temple was built in the 16th century by the Sikh warrior and martyr, Guru Ram Das. It is a symbol of Sikhism's devotion to the Sikh Gurus and its dedication to the Sikh Holy Scriptures (Guru Granth Sahib).

Here are some specific details and examples of the Golden Temple:

* The Golden Temple is a large, rectangular structure with a central tank of water, known as the Amrit Sarovar.
* The temple is surrounded by a high wall and has a central entrance, known as the Darbar Hall, which is open to all visitors.
* The temple complex also includes a langar (community kitchen), where free vegetarian meals are served to anyone who enters the temple.
* The temple is open to visitors from dawn to dusk and is visited by thousands of pilgrims every day.
* The temple is home to a statue of the Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak, and is surrounded by a large courtyard, known as the Akal Takht.
* The temple is also home to a museum, which displays artifacts and exhibits related to Sikhism and the Golden Temple.
* The temple is located in the heart of Amritsar, and is easily accessible by public transport.

The Golden Temple is a place of great spiritual significance for Sikhs around the world, and is a must-visit for anyone interested in Sikhism or Indian culture.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Temple,"

The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sāhib lit. 'House of God', Punjabi: harimandara sāhiba pronounced [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ], or the Darbār Sāhib, lit. ''exalted court'', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]) is a gurdwara located in Amritsar, Punjab, India.[2][3] It is the pre-eminent spiritual site of Sikhism. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.[2][4]
The sarovar (holy pool) on the site of the gurdwara was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.[5][6] In 1604, Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the Golden Temple and was a prominent figure in its development.[2][7] The gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan armies.[2][4][8] Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.[9][10][11]
The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government and a radical movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.[12] In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to the deaths of thousands of soldiers, militants and civilians, as well as causing significant damage to the gurdwara and the destruction of the nearby Akal Takht. The gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 attack on it.[4]
The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths.[2] It has a square plan with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool. The four entrances to the gurudwara symbolises the Sikh belief in equality and the Sikh view that all people are welcome into their holy place.[13] The complex is a collection of buildings around the sanctum and the pool.[2] One of these is Akal Takht, the chief centre of religious authority of Sikhism.[4] Additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of the Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh community-run kitchen that offers a vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination.[4] Over 150,000 people visit the holy shrine everyday for worship.[14] The gurdwara complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.[15]


Nomenclature[edit]
The Harmandir Sahib  is also spelled as Harimandar or Harimandir Sahib.[2][16] It is also called the Durbār Sahib, which means ""sacred audience"", as well as the Golden Temple for its gold leaf-covered sanctum centre.[4] The word ""Harmandir"" is composed of two words: ""Hari"", which scholars translate as ""God "",[2] and ""mandir"", which means ""house"".[17] ""Sahib"" is further appended to the shrine's name, the term often used within Sikh tradition to denote respect for places of religious significance.[18] The Sikh tradition has several Gurdwaras named ""Harmandir Sahib"", such as those in Kiratpur and Patna. Of these, the one in Amritsar is most revered.[19][20]

History[edit]
Guru Arjan overseeing the construction of the original Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib), painting from c. 1890–95
According to the Sikh historical records, the land that became Amritsar and houses the Harimandir Sahib was chosen by Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of the Sikh tradition. It was then called Guru Da Chakk, after he had asked his disciple Ram Das to find land to start a new town with a man-made pool as its central point.[5][6][21] After Guru Ram Das succeeded Guru Amar Das in 1574, and in the face of hostile opposition from the sons of Guru Amar Das,[22] Guru Ram Das founded the town that came to be known as ""Ramdaspur"". He started by completing the pool with the help of Baba Buddha (not to be confused with the Buddha of Buddhism). Guru Ram Das built his new official centre and home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle in the new town with him.[21]

A Sikh Guru (perhaps Guru Arjan) seated in the Golden Temple at Amritsar in the late 16th or early 17th century, c. 1830 Guler painting
Ramdaspur town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The town grew to become the city of Amritsar, and the area grew into the temple complex).[23] The construction activity between 1574 and 1604 is described in Mahima Prakash Vartak, a semi-historical Sikh hagiography text likely composed in 1741, and the earliest known document dealing with the lives of all the ten Gurus.[24] Guru Arjan installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new gurdwara in 1604.[23] Continuing the efforts of Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan established Amritsar as a primary Sikh pilgrimage destination. He wrote a voluminous amount of Sikh scripture including the popular Sukhmani Sahib.[25][26]

Construction[edit]
Maharaja Ranjit Singh listening to Guru Granth Sahib being recited near the Akal Takht and Golden Temple, Amritsar, Punjab, India.
Guru Ram Das acquired the land for the site. Two versions of stories exist on how he acquired this land. In one, based on a Gazetteer record, the land was purchased with Sikh donations of 700 rupees from the people and owners of the village of Tung. In another version, Emperor Akbar is stated to have donated the land to the wife of Guru Ram Das.[21][27]

The Golden Temple, Amritsar, c. 1840In 1581, Guru Arjan initiated the construction of the Gurdwara.[1] During the construction the pool was kept empty and dry. It took 8 years to complete the first version of the Harmandir Sahib. Guru Arjan planned a gurdwara at a level lower than the city to emphasise humility and the need to efface one's ego before entering the premises to meet the Guru.[1] He also demanded that the gurdwara compound be open on all sides to emphasise that it was open to all. The sanctum inside the pool where his Guru seat was, had only one bridge to emphasise that the end goal was one, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair.[1] In 1589, the gurdwara made with bricks was complete. Guru Arjan is believed by some later sources to have invited the Sufi saint Mian Mir of Lahore to lay its foundation stone, signalling pluralism and that the Sikh tradition welcomed all.[1] This belief is however unsubstantiated.[28][29] According to Sikh traditional sources such as Sri Gur Suraj Parkash Granth it was laid by Guru Arjan himself.[30] After the inauguration, the pool was filled with water. On 16 August 1604, Guru Arjan completed expanding and compiling the first version of the Sikh scripture and placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the gurdwara. He appointed Baba Buddha as the first Granthi.[31]
Ath Sath Tirath, which means ""shrine of 68 pilgrimages"", is a raised canopy on the parkarma (circumambulation marble path around the pool).[2][7][32] The name, as stated by W. Owen Cole and other scholars, reflects the belief that visiting this temple is equivalent to 68 Hindu pilgrimage sites in the Indian subcontinent, or that a Tirath to the Golden Temple has the efficacy of all 68 Tiraths combined.[33][34] The completion of the first version of the Golden Temple was a major milestone for Sikhism, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, because it provided a central pilgrimage place and a rallying point for the Sikh community, set within a hub of trade and activity.[1]

Mughal Empire era destruction and rebuilding[edit]
The growing influence and success of Guru Arjan drew the attention of the Mughal Empire. Guru Arjan was arrested under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and asked to convert to Islam.[35][36] He refused, was tortured and executed in 1606.[35][36][37] Guru Arjan's son and successor Guru Hargobind fought a Battle at Amritsar and later left Amritsar and its surrounding areas in 1635 for Kiratpur.[38][39] For about a century after the Golden Temple was occupied by the Minas.[38] In the 18th century, Guru Gobind Singh after creating the Khalsa sent Bhai Mani Singh to take back the temple.[38][40][41] The Golden Temple was viewed by the Mughal rulers and Afghan Sultans as the centre of Sikh faith and it remained the main target of persecution.[8] After the original temple was destroyed by hostile forces, the shrine was reconstructed in 1764 (a date which H.H. Cole affirms in his monograph on the temple), however most of the elaborate decorations and additions were added to the shrine in the early 19th century.[42] However, according to Giani Gian Singh's Tawarikh Sri Amritsar (1889), a slightly later date of 1776 is given for the construction of the temple tank (sarovar), the temple edifice proper, the causeway, and the entry gateway or archway (Darshani Deori).[42]
The Golden Temple was the centre of historic events in Sikh history:[43][9]

In 1709, the governor of Lahore sent in his army to suppress and prevent the Sikhs from gathering for their festivals of Vaisakhi and Diwali. But the Sikhs defied by gathering in the Golden Temple. In 1716, Banda Singh and numerous Sikhs were arrested and executed.
In 1737, the Mughal governor ordered the capture of the custodian of the Golden Temple named Mani Singh and executed him. He appointed Masse Khan as the police commissioner who then occupied the Temple and converted it into his entertainment centre with dancing girls. He befouled the pool. Sikhs avenged the sacrilege of the Golden Temple by assassinating Masse Khan inside the Temple in August 1740.
In 1746, another Lahore official Diwan Lakhpat Rai working for Yahiya Khan, and seeking revenge for the death of his brother, filled the pool with sand. In 1749, Sikhs restored the pool when Muin ul-Mulk slackened Mughal operations against Sikhs and sought their help during his operations in Multan.
In 1757, the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani, also known as Ahmad Shah Abdali, attacked Amritsar and desecrated the Golden Temple.[44] He had waste poured into the pool along with entrails of slaughtered cows, before departing for Afghanistan. The Sikhs restored it again.
In 1762, Ahmad Shah Durrani returned and had the Golden Temple blown up with gunpowder.[44] Sikhs returned and celebrated Diwali in its premises. In 1764, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia collected donations to rebuild the Golden Temple.[42] A new main gateway (Darshan Deorhi), causeway and sanctum were completed in 1776, while the floor around the pool was completed in 1784.[42] The Sikhs also completed a canal to bring in fresh water from Ravi River for the pool.
Shri Harmandir Sahib was attacked by the Afghan forces under Ahmed Shah Durrani on 1 December 1764. Baba Gurbaksh Singh along with 29 other Sikhs lead a last stand against the much larger Afghan forces and were killed in the skirmish.[45] Abdali then destroyed Shri Harmandir Sahib for the 3rd time.[46][44]
Ranjit Singh era reconstruction[edit]

Ranjit Singh founded the nucleus of the Sikh Empire at the age of 36 with help of Sukerchakia Misl forces he inherited and those of his mother-in-law Rani Sada Kaur. In 1802, at age 22, he took Amritsar from the Bhangi Sikh misl, paid homage at the Golden Temple and announced that he would renovate and rebuild it with marble and gold.[47][42] The Sikh ruler donated the gilded copper panels for the roof, which was worth 500,000 rupees in the erstwhile currency.[42] He entrusted Mistri Yar Muhammad Khan to carry-out the roofing work, who himself was supervised by Bhai Sand Singh.[42] The first gilded copper panel was placed on the shrine in 1803.[42]
Various personalities helped decorate and embellish the ceiling of the first floor, with names of some contributors to the cause being Tara Singh Gheba, Partap Singh, Jodh Singh, and Ganda Singh Peshawari.[42] Ganda Singh Peshawari sent his donation in the year 1823.[42] For the decoration and gilding with copper of the main entryway and archway to the causeway leading to the temple proper, known as the Darshani Deori, the prime personality who helped assist with this work was Raja Sangat Singh of Jind State.[42] Due to the central and paramount importance of the shrine in Sikhism, essentially every Sikh sardar of the era had contributed or donated in some manner to assist with the architectural and artistic renovations of the shrine.[42] Owing to the large number of people helping with the renovation work back then, it is difficult to account for when certain parts of the temple were constructed or decorated and by whom (aside from instances where the work has a date inscribed to it) and a chronological record of how the temple evolved over time (in-regards to its murals, decorations, and other aspects) is near-impossible to complete.[42]
The Temple was renovated in marble and copper in 1809, and in 1830 Ranjit Singh donated gold to overlay the sanctum with gold leaf.[9] There is an inscription on embossed metal located at the entrance to the temple proper which commemorates the renovations of the temple undertaken by Ranjit Singh and done through Giani Sant Singh, of the Giani Samparda.[42]

""The Great Guru in His wisdom looked upon Maharaja Ranjit Singh as his chief servitor and Sikh and, in his benevolence, bestowed on him the privilege of serving the temple.""— English translation of a Gurmukhi inscription on embossed metal located at the entrance way to the temple, translated in 'Punjab Art and Culture' (1988), page 59, by Kanwarjit Singh Kang
After learning of the Gurdwara through Maharaja Ranjit Singh,[48] the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad ""Mir Osman Ali Khan"" started giving yearly grants towards it.[49] The management and operation of Durbar Sahib – a term that refers to the entire Golden Temple complex of buildings, was taken over by Ranjit Singh. He appointed Sardar Desa Singh Majithia (1768–1832) to manage it and made land grants whose collected revenue was assigned to pay for the Temple's maintenance and operation.
Ranjit Singh also made the position of Temple officials hereditary.[2] The Giani family was the only family allowed to do Katha in the Golden Temple, they served the Sikh community till 1921, when the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee came into power, they were the only family allowed to do Katha since 1788 and were also he heads of the Giani Samparda, they had built all the Bungas around the Golden Temple and helped in construction work including overlaying the temple with Gold and Marble.[50] One of the main Bungas that was destroyed in 1988 was the Burj Gianian. The other family were the Kapurs, who were made as the Head Granthis, this included the ancestors of Bhai Jawahir Singh Kapur who also did try to become the Head Granthi in the late 1800s, but was not allowed (his father Bhai Atma Singh, grandfather Bhai Mohar Singh and their ancestors were also Head Granthis).[51]

Destruction and reconstruction after Indian independence[edit]

The destruction of the temple complex occurred during the Operation Blue Star. It was the codename of an Indian military action carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984 to remove militant Sikh Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) complex in Amritsar, Punjab. The decision to launch the attack rested with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.[52] In July 1982, Harchand Singh Longowal, the President of the Sikh political party Akali Dal, had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence in the Golden Temple Complex to evade arrest.[53][54] The government claimed Bhindranwale later made the sacred temple complex an armoury and headquarters.[55]
On 1 June 1984, after negotiations with the militants failed, Indira Gandhi ordered the army to launch Operation Blue Star, simultaneously attacking scores of Sikh temples across Punjab.[56] A variety of army units and paramilitary forces surrounded the Golden Temple complex on 3 June 1984. The fighting started on 5 June with skirmishes and the battle went on for three days, ending on 8 June. A clean-up operation codenamed Operation Woodrose was also initiated throughout Punjab.[57]
The army had underestimated the firepower possessed by the militants, whose armament included Chinese-made rocket-propelled grenade launchers with armour piercing capabilities. Tanks and heavy artillery were used to attack the militants, who responded with anti-tank and machine-gun fire from the heavily fortified Akal Takht. After a 24-hour firefight, the army gained control of the temple complex. Casualty figures for the army were 83 dead and 249 injured.[58] According to the official estimates, 1,592 militants were apprehended and there were 493 combined militant and civilian casualties.[59] According to the government claims, high civilian casualties were attributed to militants using pilgrims trapped inside the temple as human shields.[60]
Brahma Chellaney, the Associated Press's South Asia correspondent, was the only foreign reporter who managed to stay on in Amritsar despite the media blackout.[61] His dispatches, filed by telex, provided the first non-governmental news reports on the bloody operation in Amritsar. His first dispatch, front-paged by The New York Times, The Times of London and The Guardian, reported a death toll about twice of what authorities had admitted. According to the dispatch, about 780 militants and civilians and 400 troops had perished in fierce gun-battles.[62] Chellaney reported that about ""eight to ten"" men suspected of being Sikh militants had been shot with their hands tied. In that dispatch, Chellaney interviewed a doctor who said he had been picked up by the army and forced to conduct postmortems despite the fact he had never done any postmortem examination before.[63] In reaction to the dispatch, the Indian government charged Chellaney with violating Punjab press censorship, two counts of fanning sectarian hatred and trouble, and later with sedition,[64] calling his report baseless and disputing his casualty figures.[65]
The military action in the temple complex was criticised by Sikhs worldwide, who interpreted it as an assault on the Sikh religion.[66] Many Sikh soldiers in the army deserted their units;[67] several Sikhs resigned from civil administrative office and returned awards received from the Indian government. Five months after the operation, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in an act of revenge by her two Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh.[54] Public outcry over Gandhi's death led to the killings of more than 3,000 Sikhs in Delhi alone, in the ensuing 1984 anti-Sikh riots.[68] A few months after the government operation of 1984, major kar seva renovations were undertaken at the shrine complex, including a complete draining and then cleaning of the temple tank (sarovar) by volunteers.[42]
Following the operation the central government demolished hundreds of houses and created a corridor around the compound called ""Galliara"" (also spelled Galiara or Galyara) for security reasons.[69] This was made into a public park and opened in June 1988.[70][71][72][73]
In December 2021, a young man was allegedly beaten to death after disrupting the Rehras Sahib (evening prayer) at the sanctum of the temple. He reportedly jumped over a railing and picked up the sword lying before the temple's copy of the Guru Granth Sahib, before attempting to touch the Guru Granth Sahib itself. He was subsequently overpowered by the sangat and received fatal injuries to the head.[74]
The 2023 Golden Temple blasts occurred on 7 May and on 9 May 2023.[75]

Architecture[edit]

The Golden temple complex map
The Golden Temple's architecture reflects different architectural practices prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, as various iterations of temple were rebuilt and restored.[42]
The first structure of the Harmandir Sahib constructed under the purview of Guru Arjan combined the concepts of dharamsaals and the holy water tanks (sarovar).[42] Rather than copying the traditional method of Hindu temple construction by building the shrine on a high plinth, Guru Arjan rather decided to build the shrine lower than the surroundings so that devotees would have to walk downwards to reach it.[42] The four entrances represented that the Sikh faith was equally open to all four of the traditional Indian caste classifications (varnas).[42] No surviving account, depiction, or record is extant or known of the proto-type, pre-1764 Harmandir Sahib that was built by the Sikh gurus themselves.[42] However, Kanwarjit Singh Kang believes the original, Guru-constructed structure was mostly comparable and similar to the present-day structure said to have been constructed in 1764.[42]
James Fergusson considered the Golden Temple as a specimen of one of the forms that the architecture of Hindu temples developed into in the 19th century.[42] When a list of structures of interest was prepared and published by the colonial government of Punjab in 1875, it was claimed that the architectural design of the Golden Temple, in the form it was constructed as by Ranjit Singh, was based ultimately on the shrine of the Sufi saint Mian Mir.[42] Louis Rousselet stated in 1882 that the shrine was a ""handsome style of Jat architecture.""[42] Major Henry Hardy Cole described the architecture of the edifice as being primarily drawn from Islamic sources with a significant input from Hindu styles.[42] Percy Brown also classified the temple as being a synthesis of Islamic and Hindu architectural styles, but also observed that the structure has its own unique characteristics and inventions.[42] Hermann Goetz believed that the temple's architecture was a ""Kangra transformation of Oudh architecture"" that the Sikhs adopted for their own constructions, which he praises, however he also critiqued the temple for having ""gaudy"" elements commonly found in Indian gurdwaras, an example being the rococo-styled art.[42] The Temple is described by Ian Kerr, and other scholars, as a mixture of the Indo-Islamic Mughal and the Hindu Rajput architecture.[2][76]
The sanctum is a 12.25 x 12.25 metre square with two storeys and a gold leaf dome. This sanctum has a marble platform that is a 19.7 x 19.7 metre square. It sits inside an almost square (154.5 x 148.5 m2) pool called amritsar or amritsarovar (amrit means nectar, sar is short form of sarovar and means pool). The pool is 5.1 metres deep and is surrounded by a 3.7 metre wide circumambulatory marble passage that is circled clockwise. The sanctum is connected to the platform by a causeway and the gateway into the causeway is called the Darshani Ḍeorhi (from Darshana Dvara). For those who wish to take a dip in the pool, the Temple provides a half hexagonal shelter and holy steps to Har ki Pauri.[2][77] Bathing in the pool is believed by many Sikhs to have restorative powers, purifying one's karma.[78] Some carry bottles of the pool water home particularly for sick friends and relatives.[79] The pool is maintained by volunteers who perform kar seva (community service) by draining and desilting it periodically.[78]
There is a section of the shrine known as the Har-Ki-Pauri, located on the backside of the temple proper, where pilgrims and worshippers can take a sip of the water from the holy temple tank.[42] The water used for the daily ritual cleaning of the temple premises is also sourced from this section.[42] The water is mixed with milk to dilute the milk content, with the combined solution used to clean the temple's surfaces on a daily basis.[42]

Left: Causeway to the sanctum with people, behind the pool is Ath Sath Tirath; Right: Entrance view
The sanctum has two floors. The Sikh Scripture Guru Granth Sahib is seated on the lower square floor for about 20 hours every day, and for 4 hours it is taken to its bedroom inside Akal Takht with elaborate ceremonies in a palki, for sukhasana and Prakash.[33] The floor with the seated scripture is raised a few steps above the entrance causeway level. The upper floor in the sanctum is a gallery and connected by stairs. The ground floor is lined with white marble, as is the path surrounding the sanctum. The sanctum's exterior has gilded copper plates. The doors are gold leaf-covered copper sheets with nature motifs such as birds and flowers. The ceiling of the upper floor is gilded, embossed and decorated with jewels. The sanctum dome is semi-spherical with a pinnacle ornament. The sides are embellished with arched copings and small solid domes, the corners adorning cupolas, all of which are covered with gold leaf-covered gilded copper.[2] There is a pavilion located on the second-floor called the Shish Mahal (mirror room).[42]
The floral designs on the marble panels of the walls around the sanctum are Arabesque. The arches include verses from the Sikh scripture in gold letters. The frescoes follow the Indian tradition and include animal, bird and nature motifs rather than being purely geometrical. The stair walls have murals of Sikh Gurus such as the falcon carrying Guru Gobind Singh riding a horse.[2][80]

The Darshani Deorhi is a two-storey structure that houses the temple management offices and treasury. At the exit of the path leading away from the sanctum is the Prasada facility, where volunteers serve a flour-based sweet offering called Karah prasad. Typically, the pilgrims to the Golden Temple enter and make a clockwise circumambulation around the pool before entering the sanctum. There are four entrances to the gurdwara complex signifying the openness to all sides, but a single entrance to the sanctum of the temple through a causeway.[2][81][page needed]

Akal Takht and Teja Singh Samundri Hall[edit]
Main article: Akal Takht
Left: Akal Takht illuminated; Right: One of the entrance gates
In front of the sanctum and the causeway is the Akal Takht building. It is the chief Takht, a centre of authority in Sikhism. Its name Akal Takht means ""throne of the Timeless (God)"". The institution was established by Guru Hargobind after the martyrdom of his father Guru Arjan, as a place to conduct ceremonial, spiritual and secular affairs, issuing binding writs on Sikh Gurdwaras far from his own location. A building was later constructed over the Takht founded by Guru Hargobind, and this came to be known as Akal Bunga. The Akal Takht is also known as Takht Sri Akal Bunga. The Sikh tradition has five Takhts, all of which are major pilgrimage sites in Sikhism. These are in Anandpur, Patna, Nanded, Talwandi Sabo and Amritsar. The Akal Takht in the Golden Temple complex is the primary seat and chief.[82][83] It is also the headquarters of the main political party of the Indian state of Punjab, Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party).[4] The Akal Takht issues edicts or writs (hukam) on matters related to Sikhism and the solidarity of the Sikh community.
The Teja Singh Samundri Hall is the office of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (Supreme Committee of Temple Management). It is located in a building near the Langar-kitchen and Assembly Hall. This office coordinates and oversees the operations of major Sikh temples.[4][84]

Ramgarhia Bunga and Clock Tower[edit]
Main article: Ramgarhia Bunga
Left: Ramgarhia Bunga watchtowers to protect the Golden temple, Right: An 1860s photo of the Golden Temple during the colonial British era with the under-construction Gothic clock tower (which was later demolished[85]) on extreme right-side.
The Ramgarhia Bunga – the two high towers visible from the parikrama (circumambulation) walkway around the tank,[86] is named after a Sikh subgroup. The red sandstone minaret-style Bunga (buêgā) towers were built in the 18th century, a period of Afghan attacks and temple demolitions. It is named after the Sikh warrior and Ramgarhia misl chief Jassa Singh Ramgarhia. It was constructed as the temple watchtowers for sentinels to watch for any military raid approaching the temple and the surrounding area, help rapidly gather a defence to protect the Golden Temple complex. According to Fenech and McLeod, during the 18th century, Sikh misl chiefs and rich communities built over 70 such Bungas of different shapes and forms around the temple to watch the area, house soldiers and defend the temple.[87] These served defensive purposes, provided accommodation for Sikh pilgrims and served as centres of learning in the 19th century.[87] Most of the Bungas were demolished during the British colonial era. The Ramgarhia Bunga remains a symbol of the Ramgarhia Sikh community's identity, their historic sacrifices and contribution to defending the Golden Temple over the centuries.[88]
The Clock Tower did not exist in the original version of the temple. In its location was a building, now called the ""lost palace"". The officials of the British India wanted to demolish the building after the Second Anglo-Sikh war and once they had annexed the Sikh Empire. The Sikhs opposed the demolition, but this opposition was ignored. In its place, the clock tower was added. The clock tower was designed by John Gordon in a Gothic cathedral style with red bricks. The clock tower construction started in 1862 and was completed in 1874. The tower was demolished by the Sikh community about 70 years later. In its place, a new entrance was constructed with a design more harmonious with the Temple. This entrance on the north side has a clock, houses a museum on its upper floor, and it continues to be called ghanta ghar deori.[85][89]

Ber trees[edit]
The historic Dukh Bhanjani Ber tree inside the courtyard, next to Ath Sath Tirath.
The Golden Temple complex originally was open and had numerous trees around the pool. It is now a walled, two-storey courtyard with four entrances, that preserve three Ber trees (jujube). One of them is to the right of the main ghanta ghar deori entrance with the clock, and it is called the Ber Baba Buddha. It is believed in the Sikh tradition to be the tree where Baba Buddha sat to supervise the construction of the pool and first temple.[33][34]
A second tree is called Laachi Ber, believed to the one under which Guru Arjan rested while the temple was being built.[34] The third one is called Dukh Bhanjani Ber, located on the other side of the sanctum, across the pool. It is believed in the Sikh tradition that this tree was the location where a Sikh was cured of his leprosy after taking a dip in the pool, giving the tree the epithet of ""suffering remover"".[17][90] There is a small Gurdwara underneath the tree.[34] The Ath Sath Tirath, or the spot equivalent to 68 pilgrimages, is in the shade underneath the Dukh Bhanjani Ber tree. Sikh devotees, states Charles Townsend, believe that bathing in the pool near this spot delivers the same fruits as a visit to 68 pilgrimage places in India.[34]

Sikh history museums[edit]
The main ghanta ghari deori north entrance has a Sikh history museum on the first floor, according to the Sikh tradition. The display shows various paintings, of gurus and martyrs, many narrating the persecution of Sikhs over their history, as well as historical items such as swords, kartar, comb, chakkars.[91] A new underground museum near the clock tower, but outside the temple courtyard also shows Sikh history.[92][93] According to Louis E. Fenech, the display does not present the parallel traditions of Sikhism and is partly ahistorical such as a headless body continuing to fight, but a significant artwork and reflects the general trend in Sikhism of presenting their history to be one of persecution, martyrdoms and bravery in wars.[94]
The main entrance to the Gurdwara has many memorial plaques that commemorate past Sikh historical events, saints and martyrs, contributions of Ranjit Singh, as well as commemorative inscriptions of all the Sikh soldiers who died fighting in the two World Wars and the various Indo-Pakistan wars.[95]

Daily ceremonies[edit]
Left: A palanquin being prepared for the daily sukhasan ritual to carry the scripture to a bedroom; Right: A Sikh pilgrim. Some Sikhs take a dip in the pool.
There are several rites performed everyday in the Golden Temple as per the historic Sikh tradition. These rites treat the scripture as a living person, a Guru out of respect. They include:[96][97]

Closing rite called sukhasan (sukh means ""comfort or rest"", asan means ""position""). At night, after a series of devotional kirtans and three part ardās, the Guru Granth Sahib is closed, carried on the head, placed into and then carried in a flower decorated, pillow-bed palki (palanquin), with chanting. Its bedroom is in the Akal Takht, on the first floor. Once it arrives there, the scripture is tucked into a bed.[96][97]
Opening rite called prakash which means ""light"". About dawn everyday, the Guru Granth Sahib is taken out its bedroom, carried on the head, placed and carried in a flower-decorated palki with chanting and bugle sounding across the causeway. It is brought to the sanctum. Then after ritual singing of a series of Var Asa kirtans and ardas, a random page is opened. This is the mukhwak of the day, it is read out loud, and then written out for the pilgrims to read over that day.[96][97]
Guru Ram Das Langar[edit]
Langar hall from inside
Harmandir Sahib complex has a Langar, a community-run free kitchen and dining hall. It is attached to the east side of the courtyard near the Dukh Bhanjani Ber, outside of the entrance. Food is served here to all visitors who want it, regardless of faith, gender or economic background. Vegetarian food is served and all people eat together as equals. Everyone sits on the floor in rows, which is called sangat. The meal is served by volunteers as part of their kar seva ethos.[34]Volunteers helping prepare the food
Art[edit]
Main article: Sikh art
The art of the Golden Temple has rarely been analysed or studied in a serious manner.[42] Within the Shish Mahal on the second-story of the building, there are mirror-work art designs which consist of small pieces of mirror which are inlaid into the walls and ceilings, highlighed with decorations of floral designs.[42] The celings, walls and arches of the structure are embellished by intricate mural artwork.[42] The pietra dura (inlaid stone design) artwork of the shrine, which features avian and other animalistic designs using semi-precious stones, was mostly inspired by the Mughal tradition.[42] The temple premises is also decorated with embossed copper, gach, tukri, jaratkari, and ivory inlay artwork.[42] The external portions of the upper story's walls of the temple have been affixed with beaten copper plates that feature raised designs depicting usually florals and abstracts but there are some depictions of human figures as well.[42] An example of embossed metal designs depicting humans are two raised copper panels located on the front-side of the temple prior, the first which depicts Guru Nanak surrounded by his companions, Bhai Mardana and Bhai Bala, on each side.[42] The second embossed panel features an equestrian portrayal of Guru Gobind Singh.[42]
Gach can be described as a kind of stone or gypsum.[42] Gach was transformed into a paste and used on the walls, similar in nature to lime-plaster.[42] Once applied to the wall, it was decorated into shape with steel cutters and other tools.[42] Sometimes the gach had coloured glass pieces placed on it, which is known as tukri.[42] The Shish Mahal features a lot of examples of tukri work.[42] On the other hand, jaratkari was an art form and method which involved placing inlaid and cut stones of varying colours and types into marble.[42] Surviving exemplars of jaratkari art from the temple can be found on the bottom-section of the exterior walls which are encased with marble panels featuring jaratkari artwork.[42] The jaratkari marble panels in this lower exterior section is classified as pietra dura and semi-precious stones, like lapis lazuli and onyx, were utilised.[42] While the Mughals also decorated their edifices using jaratkari and pietra dura art, what sets apart the Sikh form of the art technique from the Mughal one is that the Sikh jaratkari art form also depicts human and animal figuratives with it, something that is not found in Mughal jaratkari art.[42]
Inlaid ivory work can be witnessed on the doors of the Darshani Deori structure of the complex.[42] The structure of the Darshani Deori was made out of shisham wood, the front of the edifice is overlaid with silverwork, including ornamated silver panels.[42] The back of the structure is decorated with panels consisting of floral and geometric designs but also animal figuratives, such as deer, tigers, lions, and birds.[42] Portions of the inlaid ivory had been coloured red or green, an aspect of the artwork that was praised by H.H. Cole for its harmoniousness.[42]
The oldest extant murals in the complex date back to the 1830s.[44] Most of the vast array of murals that once coated the walls of the complex were destroyed in subsequent renovation works conducted under the guise of kar seva, such as by being covered by marble slabs affixed to the walls.[44] A prominent artist who painted many of the murals in the complex was Gian Singh Naqqash.[44] The mural artwork of the temple consists primarily of floral designs with scattered examples of animal designs and themes.[42] There are over 300 different design patterns dispersed all over the walls of the edifice.[42] These wall paintings were created by Naqqashi artists, who had developed their own lingo to differentiate their various themes and designs.[42] The most prominent design category was referred to as Dehin, which is described as ""a medium of expression of the imaginative study of the artist's own creation of idealized forms"".[42] The base of dehin is known as Gharwanjh.[42] Gharwanjh is a ""decorative device involving knotted grapples between animals"".[42] The gharwanjh designs of the Golden Temple features cobras, lions, and elephants holding one another or carrying floral vases which feature fruit and fairies as decoration.[42] The decorative border of the dehin is known as Patta, usually utilising creepers for its design.[42] Furthermore, some dehin feature designs incorporating aquatic creatures.[42]

Fresco depicting Guru Gobind Singh on horseback with his retinue leaving Anandpur Fort, Kangra School, from within the Golden Temple shrine, Amritsar, ca.1820's–1830's
The only mural depicting human figures within the temple proper is located on the wall behind the northern narrow staircase leading to the top of the shrine, and it is a depiction of Guru Gobind Singh on horseback alongside his retinue leaving the fort of Anandpur, ultimately a mural adaptation of what was originally a Kangra miniature painting.[42] When H.H. Cole wrote about the murals of the Golden Temple, he witnessed many murals depicting Indic mythological scenes but these murals have since been seemingly lost to time and are no longer extant.[42]
While W. Wakefield had recorded that he observed murals depicting erotic scenes painted on the Golden Temple's walls in a work published in 1875, Kanwarjit Singh Kang finds this to be a spurious account which is likely false because there is no corroborative accounts to support this.[42]
The various artists and craftsmen who worked on creating the mural artwork and other accessory art of the temple are mostly unknown and it is nearly impossible to link any particular art piece with a specific name, aside from a very few.[42] A traditional Sikh artist who had worked at the Golden Temple, named Hari Singh, had prepared a list of all the names of the artists, painters (naqqashis), and craftsmen he could recount that had also worked at some point in time at the Golden Temple, the names are as follows: Kishan Singh, Bishan Singh, Kapur Singh, Kehar Singh, Mahant Ishar Singh, Sardul Singh, Jawahar Singh, Mehtab Singh, Mistri Jaimal Singh, Harnam Singh, Ishar Singh (not to be confused with Mahant Ishar Singh), Gian Singh, Lal Singh Tarn Taran, Mangal Singh, Mistri Narain Singh, Mistri Jit Singh, Atma Singh, Darja Mal, and Vir Singh.[42]
Most of the artwork lost over the years, throughout the various changes and renovations to the temple, were murals.[42] Murals started being lost in the temple around the last years of the 19th century, when devotees were allowed to start donating inlaid marble panels to affix to the walls of the shrine.[42] The walls that were covered by these marble panels usually were painted with murals and thus the murals were either hidden under the marble panels or destroyed.[42] The Golden Temple used to have many traditional buildings, known as bungas, surrounding it.[42] These bungas were a great source and collection of murals and thus their artwork was lost when the vast majority of the bungas were demolished over the years under the guise of modernising the religious site and expanding its parikrama.[42] When the Darshani Deori was covered with marble panels, many wall paintings that had been executed by Mahant Ishar Singh were covered up and lost due to them.[42]

Influence on contemporary era Sikhism[edit]
Singh Sabha movement[edit]
Main article: Singh Sabha Movement
The Singh Sabha movement was a late-19th century movement within the Sikh community to rejuvenate and reform Sikhism at a time when Christian, Hindu and Muslim proselytizers were actively campaigning to convert Sikhs to their religion.[98][99] The movement was triggered by the conversion of Ranjit Singh's son Duleep Singh and other well-known people to Christianity. Started in 1870s, the Singh Sabha movement's aims were to propagate the true Sikh religion, restore and reform Sikhism to bring back into the Sikh fold the apostates who had left Sikhism.[98][100][101] There were three main groups with different viewpoints and approaches, of which the Tat Khalsa group had become dominant by the early 1880s.[102][103] Before 1905, the Golden Temple had Brahmin priests, idols and images for at least a century, attracting pious Sikhs and Hindus.[104] In 1890s, these idols and practices came under attack from reformist Sikhs.[104] In 1905, with the campaign of the Tat Khalsa, these idols and images were removed from the Golden Temple.[105][106] The Singh Sabha movement brought the Khalsa back to the fore of Gurdwara administration[107] over the mahants (priests) class,[108] who had taken over control of the main gurdwaras and other institutions vacated by the Khalsa in their fight for survival against the Mughals during the 18th century[109] and had been most prominent during the 19th century.[109]

Jallianwala Bagh massacre[edit]
Main article: Jallianwala Bagh massacre
As per tradition, the Sikhs gathered in the Golden Temple to celebrate the festival of Baisakhi in 1919. After their visit, many walked over to the Jallianwala Bagh next to it to listen to speakers protesting the Rowlatt Act and other policies implemented by the British colonial government. A large crowd had gathered, when Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer ordered a detachment of ninety soldiers (drawn from the 9th Gorkha Rifles and the 59th Scinde Rifles) under his command to surround the Jallianwala Bagh, and then open fire into the crowd. 379 were killed and thousands were wounded in the massacre.[110] The massacre strengthened the opposition to colonial rule throughout India, particularly that from Sikhs. It triggered massive non-violent protests. The protests pressured the British colonial government to transfer the control over the management and treasury of the Golden Temple to an elected organisation called Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC). The SGPC continues to manage the Golden Temple.[111]

Punjabi Suba movement[edit]
Main article: Punjabi Suba movement
The Punjabi Suba movement was a long-drawn political agitation, launched by the Sikhs, demanding the creation of a Punjabi Suba, or Punjabi-speaking state, in the post-independence state of East Punjab.[112] It was first presented as a policy position in April 1948 by the Shiromani Akali Dal,[113] after the States Reorganization Commission set up after independence was not effective in the north of the country during its work to delineate states on a linguistic basis.[114] The Golden Temple complex was the main centre of operations of the movement,[115] and important events during the movement that occurred at the gurdwara included the 1955 raid by the government to quash the movement, and the subsequent Amritsar Convention in 1955 to convey Sikh sentiments to the central government.[116] The complex was also the site of speeches, demonstrations, and mass arrests,[115] and where leaders of the movement domiciled in huts during hunger strikes.[117] The borders of the modern state of Punjab, along with the official status of the state's native language of Punjabi in the Gurmukhi script, are the result of the movement, which culminated in the setting of the current borders in 1966.[118]

Operation Blue Star[edit]

Main article: Operation Blue Star
The Golden Temple and Akal Takht were occupied by various militant groups in the early 1980s. These included the Dharam Yudh Morcha led by Sikh fundamentalist Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the Babbar Khalsa, the AISSF and the National Council of Khalistan.[119] In December 1983, the Sikh political party Akali Dal's President Harchand Singh Longowal had invited Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to take up residence in Golden Temple Complex.[120] The Bhindranwale-led group under the military leadership of General Shabeg Singh had begun to build bunkers and observations posts in and around the Golden Temple.[121] They organised the armed militants present at the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar in June 1984. The Golden Temple became a place for weapons training for the militants.[119] Shabeg Singh's military expertise is credited with the creation of effective defences of the Gurdwara Complex that made the possibility of a commando operation on foot impossible. Supporters of this militant movement circulated maps showing parts of northwest India, north Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan as historic and future boundaries of the Khalsa Sikhs, with varying claims in different maps.[122]
In June 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to begin Operation Blue Star against the militants.[119] The operation caused severe damage and destroyed the Akal Takht. Numerous soldiers, militants and civilians died in the crossfire, with official estimates of death of 492 civilians and 83 Indian army men.[123] Within days of the Operation Bluestar, some 2,000 Sikh soldiers in India mutinied and attempted to reach Amritsar to liberate the Golden Temple.[119] Within six months, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards assassinated her.
In 1986, Indira Gandhi's son and the next Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi ordered repairs to the Akal Takht Sahib. These repairs were removed and Sikhs rebuilt the Akal Takht Sahib in 1999.[124]

The Mughal rulers of Punjab were evidently concerned with the growth of the Panth, and in 1605 the Emperor Jahangir made an entry in his memoirs, the Tuzuk-i-Jahāṅgīrī, concerning Guru Arjan's support for his rebellious son Khusrau Mirza. Too many people, he wrote, were being persuaded by his teachings, and if the Guru would not become a Muslim the Panth had to be extinguished. Jahangir believed that Guru Arjan was a Hindu who pretended to be a saint and that he had been thinking of forcing Guru Arjan to convert to Islam or his false trade should be eliminated, for a long time. Mughal authorities seem to have been responsible for Arjan's death in custody in Lahore, and this may be accepted as an established fact. Whether the death was by execution, the result of torture, or drowning in the Ravi River remains unresolved. For Sikhs, Guru Arjan Dev is the first martyr Guru.

Henry David Thoreau (July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862) was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher.[2] A leading transcendentalist,[3] he is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay ""Civil Disobedience"" (originally published as ""Resistance to Civil Government""), an argument in favor of citizen disobedience against an unjust state.
Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and attention to practical detail.[4] He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs.[4]
Thoreau was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending the abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of notable figures such as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr.[5]
Thoreau is sometimes referred to retrospectively as an anarchist,[6][7] but may perhaps be more properly regarded as a proto-anarchist. In his seminal essay, ""Civil Disobedience"", Thoreau wrote as follows:


""I heartily accept the motto,—'That government is best which governs least;' and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe,—'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.... But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government.""[8]



Pronunciation of his name[edit]
Amos Bronson Alcott and Thoreau's aunt each wrote that ""Thoreau"" is pronounced like the word thorough (/ˈθʌroʊ/ THURR-oh—in General American,[9][10] but more precisely /ˈθɔːroʊ/ THOR-oh—in 19th-century New England). Edward Waldo Emerson wrote that the name should be pronounced ""Thó-row"", with the h sounded and stress on the first syllable.[11] Among modern-day American English speakers, it is perhaps more commonly pronounced /θəˈroʊ/ thə-ROH—with stress on the second syllable.[12][13]

Physical appearance[edit]
Thoreau had a distinctive appearance, with a nose that he called his ""most prominent feature"".[14] Of his appearance and disposition, Ellery Channing wrote:[15]

His face, once seen, could not be forgotten. The features were quite marked: the nose aquiline or very Roman, like one of the portraits of Caesar (more like a beak, as was said); large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen, in certain lights, and in others gray,—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling, but never weak or near-sighted; the forehead not unusually broad or high, full of concentrated energy and purpose; the mouth with prominent lips, pursed up with meaning and thought when silent, and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings.
Life[edit]
Early life and education, 1817–1837[edit]
Thoreau's birthplace, the Wheeler-Minot Farmhouse in Concord, Massachusetts
Henry David Thoreau was born David Henry Thoreau[16] in Concord, Massachusetts, into the ""modest New England family""[17] of John Thoreau, a pencil maker, and Cynthia Dunbar. His father was of French Protestant descent.[18] His paternal grandfather had been born on the UK crown dependency island of Jersey.[19] His maternal Scottish-American grandfather, Asa Dunbar, led Harvard's 1766 student ""Butter Rebellion"",[20] the first recorded student protest in the American colonies.[21] David Henry was named after his recently deceased paternal uncle, David Thoreau. He began to call himself Henry David after he finished college; he never petitioned to make a legal name change.[22]
He had two older siblings, Helen and John Jr., and a younger sister, Sophia Thoreau.[23] None of the children married.[24] Helen (1812–1849) died at age 37,[24] from tuberculosis. John Jr. (1814–1842) died at age 27,[25] of tetanus after cutting himself while shaving.[26] Henry David (1817–1862) died at age 44, of tuberculosis.[27] Sophia (1819–1876) survived him by 14 years, dying at age 56,[24] of tuberculosis.[28]
He studied at Harvard College between 1833 and 1837. He lived in Hollis Hall[29] and took courses in rhetoric, classics, philosophy, mathematics, and science.[30] He was a member of the Institute of 1770[31] (now the Hasty Pudding Club). According to legend, Thoreau refused to pay the five-dollar fee (approximately equivalent to $153 in 2023) for a Harvard master's diploma, which he described thus: Harvard College offered it to graduates ""who proved their physical worth by being alive three years after graduating, and their saving, earning, or inheriting quality or condition by having Five Dollars to give the college"".[32] He commented, ""Let every sheep keep its own skin"",[33] a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas.
Thoreau's birthplace still exists on Virginia Road in Concord. The house has been restored by the Thoreau Farm Trust,[34] a nonprofit organization, and is now open to the public.

Return to Concord, 1837–1844[edit]
The traditional professions open to college graduates—law, the church, business, medicine—did not interest Thoreau,[35]: 25  so in 1835 he took a leave of absence from Harvard, during which he taught at a school in Canton, Massachusetts, living for two years at an earlier version of today's Colonial Inn in Concord. His grandfather owned the earliest of the three buildings that were later combined.[36] After he graduated in 1837, Thoreau joined the faculty of the Concord public school, but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment.[35]: 25  He and his brother John then opened the Concord Academy, a grammar school in Concord, in 1838.[35]: 25  They introduced several progressive concepts, including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses. The school closed when John became fatally ill from tetanus in 1842 after cutting himself while shaving.[37][38] He died in Henry's arms.[39]
Upon graduation Thoreau returned home to Concord, where he met Ralph Waldo Emerson through a mutual friend.[17] Emerson, who was 14 years his senior, took a paternal and at times patron-like interest in Thoreau, advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers, including Ellery Channing, Margaret Fuller, Bronson Alcott, and Nathaniel Hawthorne and his son Julian Hawthorne, who was a boy at the time.
Emerson urged Thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical, The Dial, and lobbied the editor, Margaret Fuller, to publish those writings. Thoreau's first essay published in The Dial was ""Aulus Persius Flaccus"",[40] an essay on the Roman poet and satirist, in July 1840.[41] It consisted of revised passages from his journal, which he had begun keeping at Emerson's suggestion. The first journal entry, on October 22, 1837, reads, ""'What are you doing now?' he asked. 'Do you keep a journal?' So I make my first entry to-day.""[42]
Thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition. In his early years he followed transcendentalism, a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by Emerson, Fuller, and Alcott. They held that an ideal spiritual state transcends, or goes beyond, the physical and empirical, and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine. In their view, Nature is the outward sign of inward spirit, expressing the ""radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts"", as Emerson wrote in Nature (1836).

On April 18, 1841, Thoreau moved in with the Emersons.[43] There, from 1841 to 1844, he served as the children's tutor; he was also an editorial assistant, repairman and gardener. For a few months in 1843, he moved to the home of William Emerson on Staten Island,[44] and tutored the family's sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings, including his future literary representative Horace Greeley.[45]: 68 
Thoreau returned to Concord and worked in his family's pencil factory, which he would continue to do alongside his writing and other work for most of his adult life. He resurrected the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as a binder.[46] The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, had been first patented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795.  Thoreau made profitable use of a graphite source found in New Hampshire that had been purchased in 1821 by his uncle, Charles Dunbar. The company's other source of graphite had been Tantiusques, a mine operated by Native Americans in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. Later, Thoreau converted the pencil factory to produce plumbago, a name for graphite at the time, which was used in the electrotyping process.[47]
Once back in Concord, Thoreau went through a restless period. In April 1844 he and his friend Edward Hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed 300 acres (120 hectares) of Walden Woods.[48]

""Civil Disobedience"" and the Walden years, 1845–1850[edit]
Thoreau sites at Walden Pond
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.— Henry David Thoreau, ""Where I Lived, and What I Lived For"", in Walden[49]
Thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing. In 1845, Ellery Channing told Thoreau, ""Go out upon that, build yourself a hut, & there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive. I see no other alternative, no other hope for you.""[50]  Thus, on July 4, 1845, Thoreau embarked on a two-year experiment in simple living, moving to a small house he had built on land owned by Emerson in a second growth forest around the shores of Walden Pond, having had a request to build a hut on Flints Pond, near that of his friend Charles Stearns Wheeler, denied by the landowners due to the Fairhaven Bay incident.[51][52] The house was in ""a pretty pasture and woodlot"" of 14 acres (5.7 hectares) that Emerson had bought,[53] 1+1⁄2 miles (2.5 kilometers) from his family home.[54] Whilst there, he wrote his only extended piece of literary criticism, ""Thomas Carlyle and His Works"".[55]

On July 24 or July 25, 1846, Thoreau ran into the local tax collector, Sam Staples, who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes. Thoreau refused because of his opposition to the Mexican–American War and slavery, and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal. The next day Thoreau was freed when someone, likely to have been his aunt, paid the tax, against his wishes.[5] The experience had a strong impact on Thoreau. In January and February 1848, he delivered lectures on ""The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government"",[56] explaining his tax resistance at the Concord Lyceum. Bronson Alcott attended the lecture, writing in his journal on January 26:

Heard Thoreau's lecture before the Lyceum on the relation of the individual to the State—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to self-government, and an attentive audience. His allusions to the Mexican War, to Mr. Hoar's expulsion from Carolina, his own imprisonment in Concord Jail for refusal to pay his tax, Mr. Hoar's payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal, were all pertinent, well considered, and reasoned. I took great pleasure in this deed of Thoreau's.— Bronson Alcott, Journals[57]
Thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled ""Resistance to Civil Government"" (also known as ""Civil Disobedience""). It was published by Elizabeth Peabody in the Aesthetic Papers in May 1849. Thoreau had taken up a version of Percy Shelley's principle in the political poem ""The Mask of Anarchy"" (1819), which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action.[58]
At Walden Pond, Thoreau completed a first draft of A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, an elegy to his brother John, describing their trip to the White Mountains in 1839. Thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed 1,000 copies at his own expense; fewer than 300 were sold.[43]: 234  He self-published on the advice of Emerson, using Emerson's publisher, Munroe, who did little to publicize the book.

In August 1846, Thoreau briefly left Walden to make a trip to Mount Katahdin in Maine, a journey that was later recorded in ""Ktaadn"", the first part of The Maine Woods.
Thoreau left Walden Pond on September 6, 1847.[43]: 244  At Emerson's request, he immediately moved back to the Emerson house to help Emerson's wife, Lidian, manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to Europe.[59] Over several years, as he worked to pay off his debts, he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as Walden, or Life in the Woods in 1854, recounting the two years, two months, and two days he had spent at Walden Pond. The book compresses that time into a single calendar year, using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development. Part memoir and part spiritual quest, Walden at first won few admirers, but later critics have regarded it as a classic American work that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions.
The American poet Robert Frost wrote of Thoreau, ""In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America.""[60]
The American author John Updike said of the book, ""A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible.""[61]
Thoreau moved out of Emerson's house in July 1848 and stayed at a house on nearby Belknap Street. In 1850, he moved into a house at 255 Main Street, where he lived until his death.[62]
In the summer of 1850, Thoreau and Channing journeyed from Boston to Montreal and Quebec City. These would be Thoreau's only travels outside the United States.[63] It is as a result of this trip that he developed lectures that eventually became A Yankee in Canada. He jested that all he got from this adventure ""was a cold"".[64] In fact, this proved an opportunity to contrast American civic spirit and democratic values with a colony apparently ruled by illegitimate religious and military power. Whereas his own country had had its revolution, in Canada history had failed to turn.[65]

Later years, 1851–1862[edit]
Thoreau in 1854
In 1851, Thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition. He read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal. He admired William Bartram and Charles Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle. He kept detailed observations on Concord's nature lore, recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of Walden Pond and the days certain birds migrated. The point of this task was to ""anticipate"" the seasons of nature, in his word.[66][67]
He became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town, covering an area of 26 square miles (67 square kilometers), in his journal, a two-million-word document he kept for 24 years. He also kept a series of notebooks, and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history, such as ""Autumnal Tints"", ""The Succession of Trees"", and ""Wild Apples"", an essay lamenting the destruction of the local wild apple species.
With the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines, several new readings of Thoreau began to emerge, showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots.[68][69] For instance, ""The Succession of Forest Trees"", shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction, through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals. In this lecture, first presented to a cattle show in Concord, and considered his greatest contribution to ecology, Thoreau explained why one species of tree can grow in a place where a  different tree did previously. He observed that squirrels often carry nuts far from the tree from which they fell to create stashes. These seeds are likely to germinate and grow should the squirrel die or abandon the stash. He credited the squirrel for performing a ""great service ... in the economy of the universe.""[70]

Walden Pond
He traveled to Canada East once, Cape Cod four times, and Maine three times; these landscapes inspired his ""excursion"" books, A Yankee in Canada, Cape Cod, and The Maine Woods, in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography, history and philosophy. Other travels took him southwest to Philadelphia and New York City in 1854 and west across the Great Lakes region in 1861, when he visited Niagara Falls, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Mackinac Island.[71] He was provincial in his own travels, but he read widely about travel in other lands. He devoured all the first-hand travel accounts available in his day, at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored. He read Magellan and James Cook; the arctic explorers John Franklin, Alexander Mackenzie and William Parry; David Livingstone and Richard Francis Burton on Africa; Lewis and Clark; and hundreds of lesser-known works by explorers and literate travelers.[72] Astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples, cultures, religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals. He processed everything he read, in the local laboratory of his Concord experience. Among his famous aphorisms is his advice to ""live at home like a traveler"".[73]
After John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from Brown or damned him with faint praise. Thoreau was disgusted by this, and he composed a key speech, ""A Plea for Captain John Brown"", which was uncompromising in its defense of Brown and his actions. Thoreau's speech proved persuasive: the abolitionist movement began to accept Brown as a martyr, and by the time of the American Civil War entire armies of the North were literally singing Brown's praises. As a biographer of Brown put it, ""If, as Alfred Kazin suggests, without John Brown there would have been no Civil War, we would add that without the Concord Transcendentalists, John Brown would have had little cultural impact.""[74]

Tuberculosis and death[edit]
Thoreau contracted tuberculosis in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with bronchitis.[75][76][77] His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly The Maine Woods and Excursions, and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of A Week and Walden. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, ""I did not know we had ever quarreled.""[78]

Aware he was dying, Thoreau's last words were ""Now comes good sailing"", followed by two lone words, ""moose"" and ""Indian"".[79] He died on May 6, 1862, at age 44. Amos Bronson Alcott planned the service and read selections from Thoreau's works, and Channing presented a hymn.[80] Emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral.[81] Thoreau was buried in the Dunbar family plot; his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts.

Nature and human existence[edit]
Most of the luxuries and many of the so-called comforts of life are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.— Thoreau[82]
Thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing, of conserving natural resources on private land, and of preserving wilderness as public land. He was a highly skilled canoeist; Nathaniel Hawthorne, after a ride with him, noted that ""Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it.""[83]
He was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet[84] and advocated it as a means of self-improvement. He wrote in Walden, ""The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth.""[85]

Thoreau's famous quotation, near his cabin site at Walden Pond
Thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead he sought a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred ""partially cultivated country"". His idea of being ""far in the recesses of the wilderness"" of Maine was to ""travel the logger's path and the Indian trail"", but he also hiked on pristine land.
In an essay titled, ""Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher"", environmental historian Roderick Nash wrote, ""Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance.""[86]
Of alcohol, Thoreau wrote, ""I would fain keep sober always. ... I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor. ... Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?""[85]

Sexuality[edit]
Thoreau never married and was childless. In 1840, when he was 23, he proposed to eighteen-year old Ellen Sewall, but she refused him, on the advice of her father.[87] Sophia Foord proposed to him, but he rejected her.[88]
Thoreau's sexuality has long been the subject of speculation, including by his contemporaries. Critics have called him heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual.[89][90] There is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone, man or woman. Bronson Alcott wrote that Thoreau ""seemed to have no temptations. All those strong wants that do battle with other men's nature, he knew not.""[91] Some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual.[89][92][93] The elegy ""Sympathy"" was inspired by the eleven-year-old Edmund Sewall, who had just spent five days in the Thoreau household in 1839.[94] One scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to Edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to Edmund's sister Anna,[95] and another that Thoreau's ""emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns"",[96] but other scholars dismiss this.[89][97] It has been argued that the long paean in Walden to the French-Canadian woodchopper Alek Therien, which includes allusions to Achilles and Patroclus, is an expression of conflicted desire.[98] In some of Thoreau's writing there is the sense of a secret self.[99] In 1840 he writes in his journal: ""My friend is the apology for my life. In him are the spaces which my orbit traverses"".[100] Thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time, and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire.[101]

John Brown ""Treason"" Broadside, 1859
Thoreau was fervently against slavery and actively supported the abolitionist movement.[1] He participated as a conductor in the Underground Railroad, delivered lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law, and in opposition to the popular opinion of the time, supported radical abolitionist militia leader John Brown and his party.[1] Two weeks after the ill-fated raid on Harpers Ferry and in the weeks leading up to Brown's execution, Thoreau delivered a speech to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts, in which he compared the American government to Pontius Pilate and likened Brown's execution to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ:

Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not Old Brown any longer; he is an angel of light.[4]
In ""The Last Days of John Brown"", Thoreau described the words and deeds of John Brown as noble and an example of heroism.[102] In addition, he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed Brown and his scheme as ""crazy"".[102]
Thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism. Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which ""governs not at all"", he distanced himself from contemporary ""no-government men"" (anarchists), writing: ""I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government.""[8]
Thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as ""a progress toward true respect for the individual"" and theorized about further improvements ""towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man"".[8] Echoing this belief, he went on to write: ""There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.""[8]
It is on this basis that Thoreau could so strongly inveigh against the British administration and Catholicism in A Yankee in Canada. Despotic authority, Thoreau argued, had crushed the people's sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian habitants had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent rebellions, he argued that there would be no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.[65][103]
Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of tax resistance as described in ""Resistance to Civil Government""), he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity,[104] writing: ""Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or our inability to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp.""[104] Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject ""Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?"", arguing the affirmative.[105]
Likewise, his condemnation of the Mexican–American War did not stem from pacifism, but rather because he considered Mexico ""unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army"" as a means to expand the slave territory.[106]
Thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism. On one hand he regarded commerce as ""unexpectedly confident and serene, adventurous, and unwearied""[4] and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism, writing:

I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer[4]
On the other hand, he wrote disparagingly of the factory system:

I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that the corporations may be enriched.[4]
Thoreau also favored the protection of animals and wild areas, free trade, and taxation for schools and highways,[1] and espoused views that at least in part align with what is today known as bioregionalism. He disapproved of the subjugation of Native Americans, slavery, philistinism, technological utopianism, and what can be regarded in today's terms as consumerism, mass entertainment, and frivolous applications of technology.[1]

Intellectual interests, influences, and affinities[edit]
Indian sacred texts and philosophy[edit]
Thoreau was influenced by Indian spiritual thought. In Walden, there are many overt references to the sacred texts of India. For example, in the first chapter (""Economy""), he writes: ""How much more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East!""[4] American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who ""took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world"",[107] also a characteristic of Hinduism.
Furthermore, in ""The Pond in Winter"", he equates Walden Pond with the sacred Ganges river, writing:

In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.[4]
Thoreau was aware his Ganges imagery could have been factual. He wrote about ice harvesting at Walden Pond. And he knew that New England's ice merchants were shipping ice to foreign ports, including Calcutta.[108]
Additionally, Thoreau followed various Hindu customs, including a diet largely consisting of rice (""It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India.""[4]), flute playing (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of Krishna),[109] and yoga.[110]
In an 1849 letter to his friend H.G.O. Blake, he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him:

Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged from every kind of chains, those who practice yoga gather in Brahma the certain fruits of their works. Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter. To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi.[111]
Biology[edit]

Thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology, including the works of Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin, and Asa Gray (Charles Darwin's staunchest American ally).[112] Thoreau was deeply influenced by Humboldt, especially his work Cosmos.[113]
In 1859, Thoreau purchased and read Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Unlike many natural historians at the time, including Louis Agassiz who publicly opposed Darwinism in favor of a static view of nature, Thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it,[114] stating:

The development theory implies a greater vital force in Nature, because it is more flexible and accommodating, and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation. (A quote from On the Origin of Species follows this sentence.)[112]
Influence[edit]
A bust of Thoreau from the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at the Bronx Community College
Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced ... Events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at Walden Pond have been influenced by it, including the national park system, the British labor movement, the creation of India, the civil rights movement, the hippie revolution, the environmental movement, and the wilderness movement. Today, Thoreau's words are quoted with feeling by liberals, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, and conservatives alike.— Ken Kifer, Analysis and Notes on Walden: Henry Thoreau's Text with Adjacent Thoreauvian Commentary[115]
Thoreau's political writings had little impact during his lifetime, as ""his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical"", viewing him instead as a naturalist. They either dismissed or ignored his political essays, including ""Civil Disobedience"". The only two complete books (as opposed to essays) that were published in his lifetime, Walden and A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849), both dealt with Nature, in which he ""loved to wander"".[17] His obituary was lumped in with others, rather than as a separate article, in an 1862 yearbook.[116] Critics and the public continued either to disdain or to ignore Thoreau for years, but the publication of extracts from his journal in the 1880s by his friend H.G.O. Blake, and of a definitive set of Thoreau's works by the Riverside Press between 1893 and 1906, led to the rise of what literary historian F. L. Pattee called a ""Thoreau cult"".[117]
Thoreau's writings went on to influence many public figures. Political leaders and reformers like Mohandas Gandhi, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, and Russian author Leo Tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by Thoreau's work, particularly ""Civil Disobedience"", as did ""right-wing theorist Frank Chodorov [who] devoted an entire issue of his monthly, Analysis, to an appreciation of Thoreau"".[118]
Thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including Edward Abbey, Willa Cather, Marcel Proust, William Butler Yeats, Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, Upton Sinclair,[119] E. B. White, Lewis Mumford,[120] Frank Lloyd Wright, Alexander Posey,[121] and Gustav Stickley.[122] Thoreau also influenced naturalists like John Burroughs, John Muir, E. O. Wilson, Edwin Way Teale, Joseph Wood Krutch, B. F. Skinner, David Brower, and Loren Eiseley, who Publishers Weekly called ""the modern Thoreau"".[123]
Thoreau's friend William Ellery Channing published his first biography, Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist, in 1873.[124] English writer Henry Stephens Salt wrote a biography of Thoreau in 1890, which popularized Thoreau's ideas in Britain: George Bernard Shaw, Edward Carpenter, and Robert Blatchford were among those who became Thoreau enthusiasts as a result of Salt's advocacy.[125]
Mohandas Gandhi first read Walden in 1906, while working as a civil rights activist in Johannesburg, South Africa. Gandhi first read ""Civil Disobedience"" while he sat in a South African prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the Indian population in the Transvaal. The essay galvanized Gandhi, who wrote and published a synopsis of Thoreau's argument, calling what he termed its ""incisive logic ... unanswerable"" and referring to Thoreau as ""one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced.""[126][127] He told American reporter Webb Miller, ""[Thoreau's] ideas influenced me greatly. I adopted some of them and recommended the study of Thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of Indian Independence. Why I actually took the name of my movement from Thoreau's essay 'On the Duty of Civil Disobedience', written about 80 years ago.""[128]
Martin Luther King Jr. noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading ""On Civil Disobedience"" in 1944 while attending Morehouse College. He wrote in his autobiography that it was,

Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters; a freedom ride into Mississippi; a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia; a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama; these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.[129]
American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Thoreau's Walden with him in his youth.[130] In Walden Two (published in 1948), Skinner wrote about a fictional utopian community of about 1,000 members inspired by the life of Henry Thoreau.[131] Thoreau and his fellow Transcendentalists from Concord, Massachusetts were also a major inspiration for the American composer Charles Ives, whose 1915 Piano Sonata No. 2, known as the Concord Sonata, features ""impressionistic pictures of Emerson and Thoreau"", and includes a part for flute, Thoreau's instrument, in its 4th movement.[132]
Actor Ron Thompson did a dramatic portrayal of Henry David Thoreau in the 1976 NBC television series The Rebels.[133][134][135]
Thoreau's ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the anarchist movement, with Emma Goldman referring to him as ""the greatest American anarchist"".[136] Green anarchism and anarcho-primitivism in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological points-of-view from the writings of Thoreau. John Zerzan included Thoreau's text ""Excursions"" (1863) in his edited compilation of works in the anarcho-primitivist tradition titled Against civilization: Readings and reflections.[137] Additionally, Murray Rothbard, the founder of anarcho-capitalism, has opined that Thoreau was one of the ""great intellectual heroes"" of his movement.[118] Thoreau was also an important influence on late 19th-century anarchist naturism.[138][139] Globally, Thoreau's concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles[140][141] in Spain,[138][139][140] France,[140][142] and Portugal.[143]
For the 200th anniversary of his birth, publishers released several new editions of his work: a recreation of Walden's 1902 edition with illustrations, a picture book with excerpts from Walden, and an annotated collection of Thoreau's essays on slavery.[144] The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Thoreau on May 23, 2017, in Concord, MA.[145]

Critical reception[edit]
Thoreau's work and career received little attention from his contemporaries until 1865, when the North American Review published James Russell Lowell's review of various papers of Thoreau's that Emerson had collected and edited.[146] Lowell's essay, Letters to Various Persons,[147] which he republished as a chapter in his book,  My Study Windows,[148] derided Thoreau as a humorless poseur trafficking in commonplaces, a sentimentalist lacking in imagination, a ""Diogenes in his barrel"", resentfully criticizing what he could not attain.[149] Lowell's caustic analysis influenced Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson,[149] who criticized Thoreau as a ""skulker"", saying ""He did not wish virtue to go out of him among his fellow-men, but slunk into a corner to hoard it for himself.""[150]
Nathaniel Hawthorne had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that ""He is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness.""[151] On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau ""repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men"".[152][153]
In a similar vein, poet John Greenleaf Whittier detested what he deemed to be the ""wicked"" and ""heathenish"" message of Walden, claiming that Thoreau wanted man to ""lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs"".[154]
In response to such criticisms, the English novelist George Eliot, writing decades later for the Westminster Review, characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:

People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.[155]
Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work Walden by highlighting what he felt was the irrelevance of their inquiries:

I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. ... Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; ... I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.[156]
Recent criticism has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy, and being sanctimonious, based on his writings in Walden,[157] although these criticisms have been regarded as highly selective.[158][159][160]

What was the significance of the Suez Canal Crisis?,"The Suez Canal Crisis was a major event in the history of the Middle East and the world that took place in 1956. Here are some specific details and examples of what happened during the crisis:

1. The Suez Canal is a strategic waterway that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. It is a vital transportation route for ships carrying goods between Europe and Asia.

2. In 1956, Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, which had been controlled by the British and French for many years. This move was seen as a threat to the Western powers and their interests in the region.

3. The Western powers, led by Britain and France, responded by sending a massive military force to the region, including Israel, the United States, and other countries.

4. The United Nations also issued a resolution condemning the invasion of Egypt and calling for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.

5. The conflict lasted for several weeks, with both sides suffering heavy losses. In the end, the Western powers backed down and agreed to withdraw their forces from Egypt.

6. The crisis had significant geopolitical implications, with the Western powers losing credibility in the region and Egypt emerging as a key player in the Middle East.

7. The crisis also had a significant impact on the Suez Canal, which lost much of its traffic during the conflict. It took several years for the canal to recover its pre-crisis levels of traffic.

8. The Suez Canal Crisis is seen as a turning point in the history of the Middle East, marking the beginning of a new era of regional power struggles and rivalries.

Overall, the Suez Canal Crisis was a major event in the history of the Middle East and the world that had significant geopolitical, economic, and strategic implications.",True,https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/lw/97179.htm,"

GALLIUM NITRIDE:The Fundamental Building Block for Power Electronics

Gallium nitride (GaN) is creating an innovative shift throughout the power electronics world. For decades, silicon-based MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) have been an integral part of the everyday modern world that helps convert energy to power. However, we are reaching the theoretical limit on how much silicon MOSFETs can be improved, how power-efficient they can be. With increasing power density and efficiency requirements and environmental pollution regulations trends, silicon is failing to meet these modern demands.
Gallium nitride is on the rise to replace silicon as the backbone of power switching technology as it can meet the growing needs with better power systems efficiency, performance and system cost.



WHAT IS GALLIUM NITRIDE?
Gallium Nitride is a binary III/V direct bandgap semiconductor that is well-suited for high-power transistors capable of operating at high temperatures. Since the 1990s, it has been used commonly in light emitting diodes (LED). Gallium nitride gives off a blue light used for disc-reading in Blu-ray. Additionally, gallium nitride is used in semiconductor power devices, RF components, lasers, and photonics. In the future, we will see GaN in sensor technology.
In 2006, enhancement-mode GaN transistors, sometimes referred to as GaN FETs, started being manufactured by growing a thin layer of GaN on the AIN layer of a standard silicon wafer using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The AIN layer acts as a buffer between the substrate and GaN.
This new process enabled gallium nitride transistors to be producible in the same existing factories as silicon, using almost the same manufacturing processes. By using a known process, this allows for similar, low manufacturing costs and reduces the barrier to adoption for smaller transistors with much improved performance.
To further explain, all semiconductor materials have what is called a bandgap. This is an energy range in a solid where no electrons can exist. Simply put, a bandgap is related to how well a solid material can conduct electricity. Gallium nitride has a 3.4 eV bandgap, compared to silicon’s 1.12 eV bandgap. Gallium nitride’s wider band gap means it can sustain higher voltages and higher temperatures than silicon MOSFETs. This wide bandgap enables gallium nitride to be applied to optoelectronic high-power and high-frequency devices. 
The ability to operate at much higher temperatures and voltages than gallium arsenide (GaAs) transistors also makes gallium nitride ideal power amplifiers for microwave and terahertz (ThZ) devices, such as imaging and sensing, the future market mentioned above

THE MAJOR OF ADVANTAGES OF GAN:

Reduced Weight
Reduced Size
Reduced Costs
Increased Energy Efficiency
ADVANTAGES OF GALLIUM NITRIDE
The value proposition for GaN devices consists of four major points:

Reduced energy costs – Because GaN semiconductors are inherently more efficient than silicon, less energy is expended as heat, resulting in smaller system sizes and material costs.
Higher power density (smaller volume) – Higher switching frequencies and operational temperatures than silicon result in lower cooling requirements, smaller heat sinks, conversion from liquid-cooling to air cooling, eliminating fans and reduced magnetics.
Higher switching frequency – The higher switching frequencies for GaN devices allows smaller inductors and capacitors to be used in power circuits. The inductance and capacitance scale down in proportion to the frequency – a 10X increase in frequency produces a 10X decrease in the capacitance and inductance. This can result in an enormous decrease in weight and volume, as well as cost. In addition, higher frequency can result in less acoustic noise in motor drive applications. High frequency also enables wireless power transfer at higher powers, more spatial freedom and bigger transmit to receive airgaps.
Lower system cost – While GaN semiconductors are generally higher cost than silicon, system level cost reductions result through the use of GaN by reducing the size/costs of other components such as passive inductive and capacitive circuit elements, filters, cooling, etc. Savings range from 10-20%.



IN CONCLUSIONGaN semiconductors have the capability to operate at higher voltages, temperatures and switching frequencies with greater efficiencies compared to existing Si devices. These characteristics not only result in less losses but enables significantly reduced system volume, due to decreased cooling requirements and smaller passive components contributing to overall lower system costs,

What is the Balanced Scorecard approach?,"The Balanced Scorecard approach is a framework that helps organizations align their strategy with their internal and external stakeholders. It is a strategic planning tool that provides a comprehensive view of an organization's performance and helps to measure its progress towards its goals.

The Balanced Scorecard approach consists of four perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth. Each perspective is composed of a set of measures that are used to evaluate the organization's performance.

1. Financial Perspective: This perspective focuses on the financial performance of the organization. It measures the financial health of the organization, such as revenue growth, profitability, and return on investment.
2. Customer Perspective: This perspective focuses on the customer's experience with the organization. It measures the customer satisfaction, market share, and customer retention rate.
3. Internal Processes Perspective: This perspective focuses on the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's internal processes. It measures the quality of the organization's products or services, the speed of delivery, and the cost of production.
4. Learning and Growth Perspective: This perspective focuses on the organization's ability to adapt and innovate. It measures the organization's ability to develop new products or services, the level of employee skills and knowledge, and the organization's ability to respond to changes in the market.

The Balanced Scorecard approach is used by many organizations, including AT&T, General Electric, and Hewlett-Packard. It is a flexible and adaptable tool that can be tailored to the specific needs and goals of an organization.

For example, AT&T used the Balanced Scorecard approach to align its strategy with its internal and external stakeholders. The company's strategy was focused on providing high-quality communication services to its customers. The Balanced Scorecard approach helped AT&T to measure its progress towards its goals and to identify areas for improvement. The company used the financial perspective to measure its revenue growth and profitability, the customer perspective to measure customer satisfaction and market share, the internal processes perspective to measure the quality of its products and services, and the learning and growth perspective to measure its ability to develop new products and services.

In summary, the Balanced Scorecard approach is a strategic planning tool that helps organizations align their strategy with their internal and external stakeholders. It consists of four perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth. Each perspective is composed of a set of measures that are used to evaluate the organization's performance.

Balanced Scorecard Basics










What is a Balanced Scorecard?
The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a strategic planning and management system. Organizations use BSCs to:

Communicate what they are trying to accomplish
Align the day-to-day work that everyone is doing with strategy
Prioritize projects, products, and services
Measure and monitor progress towards strategic targets

The name “balanced scorecard” comes from the idea of looking at strategic measures in addition to traditional financial measures to get a more “balanced” view of performance. The concept of balanced scorecard has evolved beyond the simple use of perspectives and it is now a holistic system for managing strategy. A key benefit of using a disciplined framework is that it gives organizations a way to “connect the dots” between the various components of strategic planning and management, meaning that there will be a visible connection between the projects and programs that people are working on, the measurements being used to track success (KPIs), the strategic objectives the organization is trying to accomplish, and the mission, vision, and strategy of the organization.

Who Uses the Balanced Scorecard (BSC)?


 
BSCs are used extensively in business and industry, government, and nonprofit organizations worldwide. More than half of major companies in the US, Europe, and Asia are using the BSC, with use growing in those areas as well as in the Middle East and Africa. A recent global study by Bain & Co listed balanced scorecard fifth on its top ten most widely used management tools around the world. BSC has also been selected by the editors of Harvard Business Review as one of the most influential business ideas of the past 75 years.

What Are Balanced Scorecard Perspectives?



The BSC suggests that we examine an organization from four different perspectives to help develop objectives, measures (KPIs), targets, and initiatives relative to those views.

Financial (or Stewardship): views an organization’s financial performance and the use of financial resources
Customer/Stakeholder: views organizational performance from the perspective of the customer or key stakeholders the organization is designed to serve
Internal Process: views the quality and efficiency of an organization’s performance related to the product, services, or other key business processes
Organizational Capacity (or Learning & Growth): views human capital, infrastructure, technology, culture, and other capacities that are key to breakthrough performance

What Are Strategic Objectives?
Strategic Objectives are the actions we must implement into our daily activities in order to see improvement in our strategies. They break down abstract concepts like mission and vision into actionable steps.

What Is a Strategy Map?
One of the most powerful elements in the BSC methodology is the use of strategy mapping to visualize and communicate how value is created by the organization. A strategy map is a simple graphic that shows a logical, cause-and-effect connection between strategic objectives (shown as ovals on the map).





What Are Performance Measures (KPIs)?




For each objective on the strategy map, at least one measure or Key Performance Indicator (KPI) will be identified and tracked over time. KPIs indicate progress toward a desirable outcome. Strategic KPIs monitor the implementation and effectiveness of an organization’s strategies, determine the gap between actual and targeted performance and determine organization effectiveness and operational efficiency.

What Are Strategic Initiatives?
Strategic Initiatives are projects (new or existing) that are designed to help the organization achieve Strategic Objectives and have significant organization-wide impact. They are managed formally like any other project, meaning they are explicitly defined in terms of owner, schedule, resources needed, action steps, progress, and expected results. Some Strategic Initiatives are short-term (taking only a few days to implement) while others can take years to fully implement. Strategic Project Management is the process of managing projects to achieve strategic success.

What is Cascading?
Cascading a balanced scorecard means to translate the corporate-wide scorecard (referred to as Tier 1) down to first business units, support units or departments (Tier 2) and then teams or individuals (Tier 3).
Cascading strategy focuses the entire organization on strategy and creating line-of-sight between the work people do and high level desired results. As the management system is cascaded down through the organization, objectives become more operational and tactical, as do the performance measures. Accountability follows the objectives and measures, as ownership is defined at each level. This alignment step is critical to becoming a strategy-focused organization.





BSC Automation and Performance Analysis
Once a scorecard has been developed and implemented, performance management software can be used to get the right performance information to the right people. Automation adds structure and discipline to implementing the Balanced Scorecard system, helps transform disparate corporate data into information and knowledge, and helps communicate performance information. The Balanced Scorecard Institute formally recommends the Spider Impact developed by Spider Strategies and co-marketed by the Institute.

Balanced Scorecard History




The Balanced Scorecard was originally developed by Dr. Robert Kaplan of Harvard University and Dr. David Norton as a framework for measuring organizational performance using a more balanced set of performance measures. Traditionally companies used only short-term financial performance as the measure of success. The “balanced scorecard” added additional non-financial strategic measures to the mix in order to better focus on long-term success. The system has evolved over the years and is now considered a fully integrated strategic management system.
This new approach to strategic management was first detailed in a series of articles and books by Drs. Kaplan and Norton and built on work by Art Schneiderman at Analog Devices. Recognizing some of the weaknesses and vagueness of previous management approaches, the balanced scorecard approach provides a clear prescription as to what companies should measure in order to ‘balance’ the financial perspective.


Kaplan and Norton describe the innovation of the balanced scorecard as follows:
“The balanced scorecard retains traditional financial measures. But financial measures tell the story of past events, an adequate story for industrial age companies for which investments in long-term capabilities and customer relationships were not critical for success. These financial measures are inadequate, however, for guiding and evaluating the journey that information age companies must make to create future value through investment in customers, suppliers, employees, processes, technology, and innovation.”

What is the Operation Wetback?,"Operation Wetback was a U.S. government initiative launched in 1954 to enforce the country's immigration laws and prevent the entry of undocumented migrants into the United States. The operation targeted primarily Mexican nationals who were seeking to enter the United States through various points of entry, such as ports of entry, airports, and land borders.

Some specific details of Operation Wetback include:

* The operation was led by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the U.S. Border Patrol, with the support of other law enforcement agencies.
* The INS and Border Patrol used a variety of methods to enforce the immigration laws, including raids, arrests, and detentions.
* The operation was particularly focused on the southwestern border, with a particular emphasis on the border between California and Arizona.
* The INS used various tactics to identify and apprehend undocumented migrants, including the use of informants and undercover agents.
* The operation was particularly harsh and aggressive, with many individuals subjected to beatings, arrests, and deportation.
* The operation was particularly controversial, with many critics arguing that it was a violation of civil liberties and a threat to the safety and security of the United States.

Some examples of Operation Wetback include:

* In 1954, a group of 200 INS agents were sent to Texas to conduct a large-scale operation targeting undocumented migrants.
* In 1956, the INS conducted a raid on a migrant camp in San Diego, California, resulting in the arrest of over 200 individuals.
* In 1957, the INS and Border Patrol conducted a raid on a migrant camp in Arizona, resulting in the arrest of over 100 individuals.
* In 1958, the INS conducted a raid on a migrant camp in California, resulting in the arrest of over 200 individuals.
* In 1960, the INS conducted a raid on a migrant camp in Texas, resulting in the arrest of over 100 individuals.

Operation Wetback was a highly controversial and damaging period in U.S. immigration history, with many individuals subjected to harsh treatment and deportation. While the operation targeted primarily Mexican nationals, it had a significant impact on the immigration policies and attitudes of the United States, and it contributed to a sense of fear and uncertainty among undocumented migrants and their families.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback,"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


1950s U.S. immigration law enforcement initiative


The U.S. Border Patrol packed Mexican immigrants into trucks when transporting them to the border for deportation during Operation Wetback.Operation Wetback was an immigration law enforcement initiative created by Joseph Swing, a retired United States Army lieutenant general and head of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The program was implemented in June 1954 by U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell.[1] The short-lived operation used military-style tactics to remove Mexican immigrants—some of them American citizens—from the United States. Though millions of Mexicans had legally entered the country through joint immigration programs in the first half of the 20th century, with some being naturalized citizens and some once native, Operation Wetback was designed to send them to Mexico.[2]
The program became a contentious issue in Mexico–United States relations, even though it originated from a request by the Mexican government to stop the illegal entry of Mexican laborers into the United States. Legal entry of Mexican workers for employment was at the time controlled by the Bracero Program, established during World War II by an agreement between the U.S. and Mexican governments. Operation Wetback was primarily a response to pressure from a broad coalition of farmers and business interests concerned with the effects of illegal immigration from Mexico.[3] Upon implementation, Operation Wetback gave rise to arrests and deportations by the U.S. Border Patrol.

Mexico began discouraging emigration to the United States in the early 1900s, beginning with President Porfirio Díaz.[4] Diaz, like many other Mexican government officials, realized that the laborers leaving for the United States would be needed to industrialize and expand the Mexican economy.[4] While Mexico did not have extensive capital, its largest asset was abundant, cheap labor, the primary resource needed to modernize the country's economy and develop industrial agribusiness.[5]
The large and growing agricultural industry in the United States created a demand for labor. From the 1920s onward, with the exception of the depression era, Mexicans served as the primary labor source for much of the agricultural industry in the United States, especially in the Southwest.[5] Every year during the 1920s, some 62,000 workers entered the United States legally, and over 100,000 illegally.[6]
Pressure from Mexican agribusiness owners to return laborers from the United States to Mexico prompted increased action by the Mexican government. The labor problems caused crops to rot in Mexican fields because so many laborers had crossed into the U.S.[7] Meanwhile, American agriculture, which was also transitioning to large-scale farms and agribusinesses, continued to recruit illegal Mexican laborers to fulfill its expanding labor requirements.[8]

The Bracero Program (1942–1964)[edit]
Main article: Bracero Program
Braceros arriving in Los Angeles, California, 1942During World War II, the Mexican and American governments developed an agreement known as the Bracero Program, which allowed Mexican laborers to work in the United States under short-term contracts in exchange for stricter border security and the return of illegal Mexican immigrants to Mexico.[9] Instead of providing military support to the U.S. and its military allies, Mexico would provide laborers to the U.S. with the understanding that border security and illegal labor restrictions would be tightened by the United States.[10] The United States agreed, based upon a strong need for cheap labor to support its agricultural businesses, while Mexico hoped to utilize the laborers returned from the United States to boost its efforts to industrialize, grow its economy, and eliminate labor shortages.[11]
The program began on September 27, 1942, when the first braceros were admitted into the United States under this agreement with Mexico.[12] The program called for braceros to be guaranteed wages, housing, food, and exemption from military service.[13] However, even though this was the agreement promised by the United States, conditions were imposed by Mexico that only healthy young men with agricultural experience who could show a permission letter stating that they were not needed in Mexico were eligible, and workers who did not fit this requirement were denied paperwork to work in America.[14]
The Bracero Program would not have a consistent implementation or direction during its 22-year duration.[15] The program itself can be classified into three main phases. The first between 1942 and 1946 saw heavy input from the Mexican government in regard to the operations of the Bracero Program.[15] The second phase was between 1947 and 1954 when the policy shifted from mass legalization of illegal immigrants to mass repatriation of said immigrants.[15] The El Paso incident (see slightly below) would begin discussion of establishing a labor pool versus dealing with the ""illegal invasion"" of these immigrants.[15] In certain cases, undocumented workers found by INS agents would be legalized as Braceros instead of deported. The final phase lasted from 1955 to 1964 and thus saw the end of the Bracero Program.[15] The paradoxical nature of wanting a source of labor in the form of Mexican immigrants but distaste for the immigrants by the population would persist in the United States.[15]
After this agreement was reached, the Mexican government continued pressuring the United States to strengthen its border security or face the suspension of the legal stream of Mexican laborers entering the United States.[7] In October 1948, Immigration officials opened the Texas–Mexico border which allowed several thousand undocumented workers to cross the border.[15] From here most workers were escorted by Border Patrol agents straight to the cotton fields.[15] This event started the informal practice of using undocumented Mexican labor while the blacklist was in place. This incident was problematic due to the direct way the US government was involved in the managing and movement of these undocumented workers.[15] This opening of the border was also in direct violation of previous agreements with the Mexican government.[15] This incident would become known as the El Paso incident.[16] Two million Mexican nationals participated in the Bracero program during its existence, but tensions between the program's stated and implicit goals,[17] plus its ultimate ineffectiveness in limiting illegal immigration into the United States, eventually led to Operation Wetback in 1954.[11]

Illegal migration after 1942[edit]
Despite the Bracero program, American growers continued to recruit and hire illegal laborers to meet their labor needs.[18] The program could not accommodate the number of Mexicans who wished to work in the United States. Many who were denied entry as a bracero crossed illegally into the United States in search of better wages and opportunity.[19] Nearly 70% of people who were attempting to immigrate to America were denied because they were viewed as undesirable for a variety of reasons, including age, gender, or other factors.[20] While the Mexican Constitution allowed citizens to cross borders freely with valid labor contracts, foreign labor contracts could not be made in the United States until an individual had already legally entered the country.[4] This conflict, combined with literacy exams and fees from INS formed significant obstacles for Mexican laborers wishing to seek higher wages and increased opportunities in the United States.
Food shortages were common in Mexico while most of the foodstuff produced was exported. Hunger and misgovernment, combined with population growth, prompted many Mexicans to attempt to enter the United States, legally or illegally, in search of wages and a better life.[21] This growth was exponential, resulting in the population nearly tripling in a short time period of forty years.[20] The Mexican government's interference with the privatization and mechanization of Mexican agriculture added more problems to finding employment in Mexico, providing yet another reason for Mexicans to enter the United States in search of higher wage jobs.[5] With the growing concern about unassimilated immigrants, and the diplomatic and security issues surrounding illegal border crossings, popular pressure caused the INS to increase its raids and apprehensions beginning in the early 1950s leading up to Operation Wetback.[22] The Korean War and the Red Scare also prompted tighter border security to prevent presumed communist infiltration.[23]
Mass deportations also affected the growing patterns in California and Arizona; although the United States had promised farm owners additional Bracero labor.[24] During the Bracero program, ""an estimated 4.6 million workers entered America legally, while other immigrants that were turned away still entered"" because of the work opportunities occurring in the southwest.[2] California then became dependent on the workers while Texas continued to hire workers illegally after this was banned by the federal government; however, because of the agricultural demand, this was overlooked.[2] While both countries were benefitting from this program in different ways, the large influx of immigration caused Eisenhower to end the program with Mexico.

Border control leading up to Operation Wetback[edit]
In 1943 more United States Border Control Officers were posted along Mexico's northern border.[25] Pressure from well-connected Mexican land and farm owners frustrated with the Bracero program prompted the Mexican government to call a meeting in Mexico City with four agencies of the United States government: the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the INS, and the Border Patrol.[26] This meeting resulted in increased border patrol along the United States–Mexico border by the United States, yet illegal immigration persisted.[26] One of the main issues was that increased pressure by the Mexican government produced more deportations, but the deported Mexicans rapidly reentered the United States. To combat this, the Mexican and American governments developed a strategy in 1945 to deport Mexicans deeper into Mexican territory by a system of planes, boats, and trains.[27] However, in 1954, negotiations surrounding the bracero program broke down, prompting the Mexican government to send 5000 troops to its border with the United States.[28]
In correspondence with assistants to President Dwight Eisenhower, Harlon Carter, head of the Border Patrol, planned Operation Cloud Burst, which requested an executive order to mobilize the military to round up illegal entrants at the southwestern border and to raid migrant camps and businesses in the interior of the United States. In deference to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, Eisenhower declined to authorize the use of Federal troops, instead appointing Army General Joseph May Swing as the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.[29][2] Eisenhower gave Swing the power to resolve border control issues in order to stabilize labor negotiations with Mexico.[30]

 United States portalvteAt its peak, the Bracero program allotted around 309,000 contracts to Mexican laborers. What followed was a series of repatriations under the name Operation Wetback. Similar repatriations can be seen during the Great Depression.[15] Operation Wetback was a program of massive apprehensions and deportations aimed at undocumented Mexican nationals, by the U.S. Border Patrol and alongside the Mexican government.[31] Planning between the INS, led by Gen. Joseph Swing as appointed by President Eisenhower and the Mexican government, began in early 1954 while the program was formally announced in May 1954.[32] Harlon Carter, then head of the Border Patrol, was a leader of Operation Wetback.[33]
In June, command teams of 12 Border Patrol agents, buses, planes, and temporary processing stations began locating, processing, and deporting Mexicans who had illegally entered the United States. A total of 750 immigration and border patrol officers and investigators; 300 jeeps, cars and buses; and seven airplanes were allocated for the operation.[34] Teams were focused on quick processing, as planes were able to coordinate with ground efforts and quickly deport people into Mexico.[35] Those deported were handed off to Mexican officials, who in turn moved them into central Mexico where there were many labor opportunities.[36] While the operation included the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, its main targets were border areas in Texas and California.[35]
Overall, there were 1,074,277 ""returns"", defined as ""confirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States not based on an order of removal"" in the first year of Operation Wetback.[37] This included many workers without papers who fled to Mexico fearing arrest; over half a million from Texas alone.[38] The total number of sweeps fell to just 242,608 in 1955, and continuously declined each year until 1962, when there was a slight rise in apprehended workers.[39] Despite the decline in sweeps, the total number of Border Patrol agents more than doubled to 1,692 by 1962, and an additional plane was added to the force.[39]
During the entirety of the Operation, border recruitment of illegal workers by American growers continued, due largely to the low cost of illegal labor, and the desire of growers to avoid the bureaucratic obstacles of the Bracero program. The continuation of illegal immigration, despite the efforts of Operation Wetback, along with public outcry over many US citizens removed, was largely responsible for the failure of the program.[40] Because of these factors, operation Wetback lost funding.[2]
The program resulted in a more permanent, strategic border control presence along the Mexico–United States border.[41]

Timeline[edit]




Date

Event


June 9

California roundup and deportation begins[15]


June 10

Phase One Arizona-California, Operation: Buslift
First Greyhound bus leaves El Centro, California bound for Nogales, Arizona. On board are detainees from the San Francisco regional detention center and roadblock inspection captures. 28 buses transport 1,008 migrants to Arizona where they will be transferred into the interior of Mexico.[15]



June 17

Phase Two of California to Arizona, Operation: Sweeps
The Agricultural regions of Arizona and Southern California become primary sweep targets. INS authorities employ the aid of farmers to reveal undocumented workers.[15]



June 17–26

Through the assistance of local police, 4,403 people are rounded up. 64% of them were working in non-agricultural jobs.[15]


June 20

Sweeps continue throughout the Central Valley of California through bases set up in Fresno and Sacramento.[15]


June 24

Bill 3660 and Bill 3661 are proposed in both houses of Congress with the intent to dissuade employers and smugglers from employing/bringing in illegal immigrants. Neither bill passed.[15]


July 3

The first mobile task force is dispatched in McAllen, Texas. Their goal was to set up roadblock inspections, inspect trains, and dissuade any migrants from heading north.[15]


July 15

First day of complete operation in Texas with a focus on the Lower Rio Grande Valley.[15]


September 3

First deportation by sea. The SS Emancipation and SS Vera Cruz sail the 2,000-mile voyage from Port Isabel, Texas to Veracruz, Mexico a total of 26 times. Both ships transport around 800 illegal immigrants per voyage.[15]


September 18

First airlift from Midwest begins. The deportees in Chicago are transported to Brownsville, Texas. More airlifts arrive from Kansas City, Saint Louis, Memphis and Dallas. From here, the deportees are sent to Veracruz by sea.[15]

Consequences[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (September 2022)
The name ""wetback"" is a slur applied to illegal entrants who supposedly entered the United States by swimming the Rio Grande.[42] It became a derogatory term applied generally to Mexican laborers, including those who were legal residents.[43] Similarly, the 1855 Greaser Act was so-known based on the anti-Mexican slur ""greaser"".
One of the biggest problems caused by the program for the deportees was sending them to unfamiliar parts of Mexico, where they struggled to find their way home or to continue to support their families.[44] More than 25% of apprehended Mexicans were returned to Veracruz on cargo ships, while others were transported by land to southern cities in Mexico.[45] Those apprehended were often deported without receiving the opportunity to recover their property in the United States, or to contact their families prior to deportation.
Deportees often were stranded without any food or employment when they were released in Mexico.[46] Deported Mexicans sometimes faced extreme conditions in their country; 88 deported workers died in the 112 °F (44 °C) heat in July 1955.[35] Another issue was repeated illegal border crossings by those who had been previously deported; from 1960 through 1961, repeaters accounted for 20% of the total deportees.[39] Certain U.S. Border Patrol agents practiced shaving heads to mark repeat offenders who might attempt to reenter the United States. There were also reports of beating and jailing chronically offending illegal immigrants before deporting them.[47] While most complaints concerning deportation were undocumented, there were more than 11,000 formal complaints (about 1% of all actions) from documented bracero workers from 1954 through 1964.[48]
Operation Wetback was the culmination of more than a decade of intensifying immigration enforcement. Immigration enforcement actions (removals and returns) rose rapidly from a low of 12,000 in 1942, to 727,000 in 1952, the final year of the Truman Administration. Enforcement actions continued to rise under Eisenhower, until reaching a peak of 1.1 million in 1954, the year of Operation Wetback. Enforcement actions then fell by more than 90 percent in 1955, and 1956, and in 1957 were 69,000, the lowest number since 1944. The number of enforcement actions rose again in the 1960s and 1970s, but did not exceed the 1954 peak of Operation Wetback until 1986.[37]
At the same time that immigration enforcement was expanding in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Bracero program was also rapidly expanding legal opportunities for Mexican laborers. Although it began as a wartime measure, the Bracero program saw its largest expansion after the war. The number of wartime braceros peaked at 62,000 in 1944, but the number began to rise again in the late 1940s, and reached its peak in 1956, when the program gave temporary work permits to 445,000 Mexican workers.[49]

"
What was the issue with the Blood Diamonds in the diamond industry?,"The issue with blood diamonds in the diamond industry refers to the use of diamonds obtained through unethical and illegal means, such as armed conflict, human rights abuses, and environmental destruction. The term ""blood diamonds"" was coined to describe the diamonds mined in conflict-ridden areas, particularly in Africa, where the diamond trade is a vital source of revenue for many local communities.

The specific details and examples of the issue with blood diamonds in the diamond industry include:

* The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) was established in 2003 to prevent the sale of diamonds mined in conflict areas from entering the international market. The KPCS requires participating countries to inspect rough diamonds and certify that they were not mined in conflict zones. However, there have been allegations that the KPCS has been ineffective in preventing the sale of diamonds mined in conflict areas, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
* The diamond trade has been linked to human rights abuses, such as the use of child labor, exploitation of workers, and forced labor in mines. The International Labour Organization estimates that there are more than 200,000 child laborers in the diamond industry, particularly in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Zimbabwe.
* Environmental destruction is another major issue associated with the diamond industry. Mining for diamonds often involves the destruction of forests, rivers, and other natural resources, as well as the pollution of water and air.
* The diamond trade has been accused of fueling conflicts and supporting armed groups in conflict-ridden areas. For example, the Central African Republic has been plagued by conflict since 2013, with diamond mining being used by armed groups to fund their operations.
* The diamond trade has also been linked to corruption and money laundering. The diamond industry has been criticized for being a haven for illicit financial flows, as diamonds are often sold on the black market or used to fund criminal activities.

Overall, the issue with blood diamonds in the diamond industry refers to the use of diamonds obtained through unethical and illegal means, such as armed conflict, human rights abuses, and environmental destruction. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme has been established to prevent the sale of diamonds mined in conflict areas from entering the international market, but there have been allegations that it has been ineffective in preventing the sale of diamonds mined in conflict areas. The diamond trade has been linked to human rights abuses, environmental destruction, and corruption, and has been accused of fueling conflicts and supporting armed groups in conflict-ridden areas.",True,https://www.brilliantearth.com/about/mission/transparency/blood-diamonds/,Just a moment...Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue
What is the Lake Baikal?,"Lake Baikal is the oldest, deepest, and most diverse lake in the world. It is located in southern Siberia, Russia, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

* The lake is approximately 2,500 meters (8,202 feet) deep and covers an area of 31,713 square kilometers (12,229 square miles).
* The lake is home to over 1,400 species of plants and animals, including the Baikal seal, the Baikal sturgeon, and the Baikal three-spined stickleback.
* The lake is known for its crystal clear water, which allows sunlight to penetrate to a depth of 150 meters (492 feet).
* The lake is also home to the world's oldest living organism, a 2,380-year-old alga called Dreissenia bugensis.
* The lake is also known for its diverse fishing industry, with species such as whitefish, pike, and salmon being caught in the lake.
* The lake is also a popular tourist destination, with visitors able to take cruises on the lake, explore the surrounding islands, and participate in activities such as ice skating and skiing.
* The lake is also a source of hydropower, with the Olkhon Hydroelectric Power Plant located on the lake's largest island.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal,"

Lake Baikal[a] is a rift lake and the deepest lake in the world. It is situated in southern Siberia, Russia between the federal subjects of Irkutsk Oblast to the northwest and the Republic of Buryatia to the southeast.
At 31,722 km2 (12,248 sq mi)—slightly larger than Belgium—Lake Baikal is the world's seventh-largest lake by surface area,[5] as well as the second largest lake in Eurasia after the Caspian Sea. However, because it is also the deepest lake,[6] with a maximum depth of 1,642 metres (5,387 feet; 898 fathoms),[1] Lake Baikal is the world's largest freshwater lake by volume, containing 23,615.39 km3 (5,670 cu mi) of water[1] or 22–23% of the world's fresh surface water,[7][8] more than all of the North American Great Lakes combined.[9] It is also the world's oldest lake[10] at 25–30 million years,[11][12] and among the clearest.[13]
Lake Baikal is home to thousands of species of plants and animals, many of them endemic to the region. It is also home to Buryat tribes, who raise goats, camels, cattle, sheep, and horses[14] on the eastern side of the lake,[15] where the mean temperature varies from a winter minimum of −19 °C (−2 °F) to a summer maximum of 14 °C (57 °F).[16] The region to the east of Lake Baikal is referred to as Transbaikalia or as the Transbaikal,[17] and the loosely defined region around the lake itself is sometimes known as Baikalia. UNESCO declared Baikal a World Heritage Site in 1996.[18]


Geography and hydrography[edit]
The Yenisey basin, which includes Lake Baikal
A digital elevation model of Lake Baikal region
Lake Baikal is in a rift valley, created by the Baikal Rift Zone, where the Earth's crust is slowly pulling apart.[5] At 636 km (395 mi) long and 79 km (49 mi) wide, Lake Baikal has the largest surface area of any freshwater lake in Asia, at 31,722 km2 (12,248 sq mi), and is the deepest lake in the world at 1,642 metres (5,387 feet; 898 fathoms). The surface of the lake is 455.5 m (1,494 ft) above sea level, while the bottom of the lake is 1,186.5 m (3,893 ft; 648.8 fathoms) below sea level, and below this lies some 7 km (4.3 mi) of sediment, placing the rift floor some 8–11 km (5.0–6.8 mi) below the surface, the deepest continental rift on Earth.[5]
In geological terms, the rift is young and active – it widens about 4 mm (0.16 in) per year.[19] The fault zone is also seismically active; hot springs occur in the area and notable earthquakes happen every few years. The lake is divided into three basins: North, Central, and South, with depths about 900 m (3,000 ft), 1,600 m (5,200 ft), and 1,400 m (4,600 ft), respectively. Fault-controlled accommodation zones rising to depths about 300 m (980 ft) separate the basins. The North and Central basins are separated by Academician Ridge, while the area around the Selenga Delta and the Buguldeika Saddle separates the Central and South basins. The lake drains into the Angara, a tributary of the Yenisey. Landforms include Cape Ryty on Baikal's northwest coast.
Baikal's age is estimated at 25–30 million years, making it the most ancient lake in geological history.[11][12] It is unique among large, high-latitude lakes, as its sediments have not been scoured by overriding continental ice sheets. Russian, U.S., and Japanese cooperative studies of deep-drilling core sediments in the 1990s provide a detailed record of climatic variation over the past 6.7 million years.[20][21]
Longer and deeper sediment cores are expected in the near future.[needs update] Lake Baikal is the only confined freshwater lake in which direct and indirect evidence of gas hydrates exists.[22][23][24]
The lake is surrounded by mountains; the Baikal Mountains on the north shore, the Barguzin Range on the northeastern shore and the Primorsky Range stretching along the western shore. The mountains and the taiga are protected as a national park. It contains 27 islands; the largest, Olkhon, is 72 km (45 mi) long and is the third-largest lake-bound island in the world. The lake is fed by as many as 330 inflowing rivers.[25] The main ones draining directly into Baikal are the Selenga, the Barguzin, the Upper Angara, the Turka, the Sarma, and the Snezhnaya. It is drained through a single outlet, the Angara.
Regular winds exist in Baikal's rift valley.[26]

Water characteristics[edit]
Lake Baikal's water is especially clear
Baikal is one of the clearest lakes in the world.[13] During the winter, the water transparency in open sections can be as much as 30–40 m (100–130 ft), but during the summer it is typically 5–8 m (15–25 ft).[27] Baikal is rich in oxygen, even in deep sections,[27] which separates it from distinctly stratified bodies of water such as Lake Tanganyika and the Black Sea.[28][29]
In Lake Baikal, the water temperature varies significantly depending on location, depth, and time of the year. During the winter and spring, the surface freezes for about 4–5 months; from early January to early May–June (latest in the north), the lake surface is covered in ice.[30] On average, the ice reaches a thickness of 0.5 to 1.4 m (1.6–4.6 ft),[31] but in some places with hummocks, it can be more than 2 m (6.6 ft).[30] During this period, the temperature slowly increases with depth in the lake, being coldest near the ice-covered surface at around freezing, and reaching about 3.5–3.8 °C (38.3–38.8 °F) at a depth of 200–250 m (660–820 ft).[32] After the surface ice breaks up, the surface water is slowly warmed up by the sun, and in May–June, the upper 300 m (980 ft) or so becomes homothermic (same temperature throughout) at around 4 °C (39 °F) because of water mixing.[27][32] The sun continues to heat up the surface layer, and at the peak in August can reach up to about 16 °C (61 °F) in the main sections[32] and 20–24 °C (68–75 °F) in shallow bays in the southern half of the lake.[27][33] During this time, the pattern is inverted compared to the winter and spring, as the water temperature falls with increasing depth. As the autumn begins, the surface temperature falls again and a second homothermic period at around 4 °C (39 °F) of the upper circa 300 m (980 ft) occurs in October–November.[27][32] In the deepest parts of the lake, from about 300 m (980 ft), the temperature is stable at 3.1–3.4 °C (37.6–38.1 °F) with only minor annual variations.[32]
The average surface temperature has risen by almost 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) in the last 50 years, resulting in a shorter period where the lake is covered by ice.[12] At some locations, hydrothermal vents with water that is about 50 °C (122 °F) have been found. These are mostly in deep water but locally have also been found in relatively shallow water. They have little effect on the lake's temperature because of its huge volume.[32]
Stormy weather on the lake is common, especially during the summer and autumn, and can result in waves as high as 4.5 m (15 ft).[27]

Fauna and flora[edit]
The Baikal seal is endemic to Lake Baikal.
Lake Baikal is rich in biodiversity. It hosts more than 1,000 species of plants and 2,500 species of animals based on current knowledge, but the actual figures for both groups are believed to be significantly higher.[27][34] More than 80% of the animals are endemic.[34]

Flora[edit]
The watershed of Lake Baikal has numerous floral species represented. The marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre) is found here at the eastern limit of its geographic range.[35]
Submerged macrophytic vascular plants are mostly absent, except in some shallow bays along the shores of Lake Baikal.[36] More than 85 species of submerged macrophytes have been recorded, including genera such as Ceratophyllum, Myriophyllum, Potamogeton, and Sparganium.[33] The invasive species Elodea canadensis was introduced to the lake in the 1950s.[36] Instead of vascular plants, aquatic flora is often dominated by several green algae species, notably Draparnaldioides, Tetraspora, and Ulothrix in water shallower than 20 m (65 ft); although Aegagrophila, Cladophora, and Draparnaldioides may occur deeper than 30 m (100 ft).[36] Except for Ulothrix, there are endemic Baikal species in all these green algae genera.[36] More than 400 diatom species, both benthic and planktonic, are found in the lake, and about half of these are endemic to Baikal; however, significant taxonomic uncertainties remain for this group.[36]

Fauna[edit]
Mammals[edit]
Baikal seal
The Baikal seal or nerpa (Pusa sibirica) is endemic to Lake Baikal.[37]
A wide range of land mammals can be found in the habitats around the lake, such as the brown bear (Ursus arctos), Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), sable (Martes zibellina), stoat (Mustela erminea), least weasel (Mustela nivalis), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis), moose (Alces alces), elk (Cervus canadensis), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), Siberian chipmunk (Eutamias sibiricus), marmots (Marmota sp.), lemmings (Lemmus sp.), and mountain hare (Lepus timidus).[38] Until the Early Middle Ages, populations of the European bison (Bison bonasus) were found near the lake; this represented the easternmost range of the species.[39]

Birds[edit]
Mongolian gulls on Baikal
There are 236 species of birds that inhabit Lake Baikal, 29 of which are waterfowl.[40] Although named after the lake, both the Baikal teal and Baikal bush warbler are widespread in eastern Asia.[41][42]

Fish[edit]
Two species of grayling (Thymallus baikalensis and T. brevipinnis) are found only in Baikal and rivers that drain into the lake.[43][44]
Fewer than 65 native fish species occur in the lake basin, but more than half of these are endemic.[27][45] The families Abyssocottidae (deep-water sculpins), Comephoridae (golomyankas or Baikal oilfish), and Cottocomephoridae (Baikal sculpins) are entirely restricted to the lake basin.[27][46] All these are part of the Cottoidea and are typically less than 20 cm (8 in) long.[36] Of particular note are the two species of golomyanka (Comephorus baicalensis and C. dybowskii). These long-finned, translucent fish typically live in open water at depths of 100–500 m (330–1,640 ft), but occur both shallower and much deeper. Together with certain abyssocottid sculpins, they are the deepest living freshwater fish in the world, occurring near the bottom of Lake Baikal.[47] The golomyankas are the primary prey of the Baikal seal and represent the largest fish biomass in the lake.[48] Beyond members of Cottoidea, there are few endemic fish species in the lake basin.[27][45]

The omul (Coregonus migratorius) is endemic to Lake Baikal, and is a source of income to locals.
The most important local species for fisheries is the omul (Coregonus migratorius), an endemic whitefish.[27] It is caught, smoked, and then sold widely in markets around the lake. Also, a second endemic whitefish inhabits the lake, C. baicalensis.[49] The Baikal black grayling (Thymallus baicalensis), Baikal white grayling (T. brevipinnis), and Baikal sturgeon (Acipenser baerii baicalensis) are other important species with commercial value. They are also endemic to the Lake Baikal basin.[43][44][50][51]

Invertebrates[edit]
The lake hosts a rich endemic fauna of invertebrates. The copepod Epischura baikalensis is endemic to Lake Baikal and the dominating zooplankton species there, making up 80 to 90% of the total biomass.[52] It is estimated that they filter as much as a thousand cubic kilometers of water a year, or the lake's entire volume every twenty-three years.[53]
Among the most diverse invertebrate groups are the amphipod and ostracod crustaceans, freshwater snails, annelid worms and turbellarian worms:

Amphipod, isopod, cladoceran and ostracod crustaceans[edit]
A ""giant"" Brachyuropus reicherti (Acanthogammaridae) amphipod caught during ice fishing in the lake. Red-orange is its natural, living coloration
More than 350 species and subspecies of amphipods are endemic to the lake.[34] They are exceptionally diverse in ecology and appearance, ranging from the pelagic Macrohectopus to the relatively large deep-water Abyssogammarus and Garjajewia, the tiny herbivorous Micruropus, and the parasitic Pachyschesis (parasitic on other amphipods).[54] The ""gigantism"" of some Baikal amphipods, which has been compared to that seen in Antarctic amphipods, has been linked to the high level of dissolved oxygen in the lake.[55] Among the ""giants"" are several species of spiny Acanthogammarus and Brachyuropus (Acanthogammaridae) found at both shallow and deep depths.[56] These conspicuous and common amphipods are essentially carnivores (will also take detritus), and can reach a body length up to 7 cm (2.8 in).[54][56]
The number of isopods is low; they belong to the family Asellidae. There are four species of the genus Baicalasellus, and the two species Mesoasellus dybowskii and Limnoasellus poberezhnii.[57][58] These six endemic species are found on rocky substrata in depths varying from 3–10 meters (Baicalasellus angarensis) to more than hundred meters (Mesoasellus dybowskii).[59]
There are about 60 known species of cladocerans (water fleas), several of them endemic.[60]
Similar to another ancient lake, Tanganyika, Baikal is a center for ostracod diversity. About 90% of the Lake Baikal ostracods are endemic,[61] meaning that there are c. 200 endemic species.[62] This makes it the second-most diverse group of crustacean in the lake, after the amphipods.[61] The vast majority of the Baikal ostracods belong to the families Candonidae (more than 100 described species) and Cytherideidae (about 50 described species),[61][63] but genetic studies indicate that the true diversity in at least the latter family has been heavily underestimated.[64] The morphology of the Baikal ostracods is highly diverse.[61]

Snails and bivalves[edit]
As of 2006[update], almost 150 freshwater snails are known from Lake Baikal, including 117 endemic species from the subfamilies Baicaliinae (part of the Amnicolidae) and Benedictiinae (part of the Lithoglyphidae), and the families Planorbidae and Valvatidae.[65] All endemics have been recorded between 20 and 30 m (66 and 98 ft), but the majority mainly live at shallower depths.[65] About 30 freshwater snail species can be seen deeper than 100 m (330 ft), which represents the approximate limit of the sunlight zone, but only 10 are truly deepwater species.[65] In general, Baikal snails are thin-shelled and small. Two of the most common species are Benedictia baicalensis and Megalovalvata baicalensis.[66] Bivalve diversity is lower with more than 30 species; about half of these, all in the families Euglesidae, Pisidiidae, and Sphaeriidae, are endemic (the only other family in the lake is the Unionidae with a single nonendemic species).[66][67] The endemic bivalves are mainly found in shallows, with few species from deep water.[68]

Aquatic worms[edit]
With almost 200 described species, including more than 160 endemics, the center of diversity for aquatic freshwater oligochaetes is Lake Baikal.[69] A smaller number of other freshwater annelids is known: 30 species of leeches (Hirudinea),[70] and 4 polychaetes.[69] Several hundred species of nematodes are known from the lake, but a large percentage of these are undescribed.[69]
More than 140 endemic flatworm (Plathelminthes) species are in Lake Baikal, where they occur on a wide range of bottom types.[71] Most of the flatworms are predatory, and some are relatively brightly marked. They are often abundant in shallow waters, where they are typically less than 2 cm (1 in) long, but in deeper parts of the lake, the largest, Baikaloplana valida, can reach up to 30 cm (1 ft) when outstretched.[36][71]

Sponges[edit]
At least 18 species of sponges occur in the lake,[72] including about 15 species from the endemic family Lubomirskiidae (the remaining are from the nonendemic family Spongillidae),[73][74] which colonized the lake about 3.4 million years ago. The lake's sponges makes up around 44% of the benthic animal biomass.[75] Lubomirskia baicalensis, Baikalospongia bacillifera, and B. intermedia are unusually large for freshwater sponges and can reach 1 m (3.3 ft) or more.[72][76] These three are also the most common sponges in the lake.[72] While the Baikalospongia species typically have encrusting or carpet-like structures, L. baikalensis often has branching structures and in areas where common may form underwater ""forests"".[77] Most sponges in the lake are typically green when alive because of symbiotic chlorophytes (zoochlorella), but can also be brownish or yellowish.[78]

History[edit]
The Baikal area, sometimes known as Baikalia, has a long history of human habitation. Near the village of Mal'ta, some 160 km northwest of the lake, remains of a young human male known as MA-1 or ""Mal'ta Boy"" are indications of local habitation by the Mal'ta–Buret' culture ca. 24,000 BP. An early known tribe in the area was the Kurykans.[79]
Located in the former northern territory of the Xiongnu confederation, Lake Baikal is one site of the Han–Xiongnu War, where the armies of the Han dynasty pursued and defeated the Xiongnu forces from the second century BC to the first century AD. They recorded that the lake was a ""huge sea"" (hanhai) and designated it the North Sea (Běihǎi) of the semimythical Four Seas.[80] The Kurykans, a Siberian tribe who inhabited the area in the sixth century, gave it a name that translates to ""much water"". Later on, it was called ""natural lake"" (Baygal nuur) by the Buryats and ""rich lake"" (Bay göl) by the Yakuts.[81] 
Little was known to Europeans about the lake until Russia expanded into the area in the 1600s. The first Russian explorer to reach Lake Baikal was Kurbat Ivanov in 1643.[82]
Lake Baikal was under the Anbei Protectorate of the Tang dynasty from 647 CE to 682 CE.
Russian expansion into the Buryat area around Lake Baikal[83] in 1628–1658 was part of the Russian conquest of Siberia. It was done first by following the Angara River upstream from Yeniseysk (founded 1619) and later by moving south from the Lena River. Russians first heard of the Buryats in 1609 at Tomsk. According to folktales related a century after the fact, in 1623, Demid Pyanda, who may have been the first Russian to reach the Lena, crossed from the upper Lena to the Angara and arrived at Yeniseysk.[84]
Vikhor Savin (1624) and Maksim Perfilyev (1626 and 1627–28) explored Tungus country on the lower Angara. To the west, Krasnoyarsk on the upper Yenisei was founded in 1627. A number of ill-documented expeditions explored eastward from Krasnoyarsk. In 1628, Pyotr Beketov first encountered a group of Buryats and collected yasak (tribute) from them at the future site of Bratsk. In 1629, Yakov Khripunov set off from Tomsk to find a rumored silver mine. His men soon began plundering both Russians and natives. They were joined by another band of rioters from Krasnoyarsk, but left the Buryat country when they ran short of food. This made it difficult for other Russians to enter the area. In 1631, Maksim Perfilyev built an ostrog at Bratsk. The pacification was moderately successful, but in 1634, Bratsk was destroyed and its garrison killed. In 1635, Bratsk was restored by a punitive expedition under Radukovskii. In 1638, it was besieged unsuccessfully.[citation needed]
In 1638, Perfilyev crossed from the Angara over the Ilim portage to the Lena River and went downstream as far as Olyokminsk. Returning, he sailed up the Vitim River into the area east of Lake Baikal (1640) where he heard reports of the Amur country. In 1641, Verkholensk was founded on the upper Lena. In 1643, Kurbat Ivanov went further up the Lena and became the first Russian to see Lake Baikal and Olkhon Island. Half his party under Skorokhodov remained on the lake, reached the Upper Angara at its northern tip, and wintered on the Barguzin River on the northeast side.[citation needed]
In 1644, Ivan Pokhabov went up the Angara to Baikal, becoming perhaps the first Russian to use this route, which is difficult because of the rapids. He crossed the lake and explored the lower Selenge River. About 1647, he repeated the trip, obtained guides, and visited a 'Tsetsen Khan' near Ulan Bator. In 1648, Ivan Galkin built an ostrog on the Barguzin River which became a center for eastward expansion. In 1652, Vasily Kolesnikov reported from Barguzin that one could reach the Amur country by following the Selenga, Uda, and Khilok Rivers to the future sites of Chita and Nerchinsk.[citation needed]
The Trans-Siberian Railway was built between 1896 and 1902. Construction of the scenic railway around the southwestern end of Lake Baikal required 200 bridges and 33 tunnels. Until its completion, a train ferry, the SS Baikal, transported railcars across the lake from Port Baikal to Mysovaya for a number of years. The lake became the site of the minor engagement between the Czechoslovak legion and the Red Army in 1918. At times during winter freezes, the lake could be crossed on foot, though at risk of frostbite and deadly hypothermia from the cold wind moving unobstructed across flat expanses of ice. In the winter of 1920, the Great Siberian Ice March occurred, when the retreating White Russian Army crossed frozen Lake Baikal. The wind on the exposed lake was so cold, many people died, freezing in place until spring thaw. Beginning in 1956, the impounding of the Irkutsk Dam on the Angara River raised the level of the lake by 1.4 m (4.6 ft).[85]
As the railway was built, a large hydrogeographical expedition headed by F.K. Drizhenko produced the first detailed contour map of the lake bed.[10]

Research[edit]
Ice cover survey on the lake
Several organizations are carrying out natural research projects on Lake Baikal. Most of them are governmental or associated with governmental organizations. The Baikalian Research Centre is an independent research organization carrying out environmental, educational and research projects at Lake Baikal.[86]
In July 2008, Russia sent two small submersibles, Mir-1 and Mir-2, to descend 1,592 m (5,223 ft) to the bottom of Lake Baikal to conduct geological and biological tests on its unique ecosystem. Although originally reported as being successful, they did not set a world record for the deepest freshwater dive, reaching a depth of only 1,580 m (5,180 ft).[87] That record is currently held by Anatoly Sagalevich, at 1,637 m (5,371 ft) (also in Lake Baikal aboard a Pisces submersible in 1990).[87][88] Russian scientist and federal politician Artur Chilingarov, the leader of the mission, took part in the Mir dives[89] as did Russian president Vladimir Putin.[90]
Since 1993, neutrino research has been conducted at the Baikal Deep Underwater Neutrino Telescope (BDUNT). The Baikal Neutrino Telescope NT-200 is being deployed in Lake Baikal, 3.6 km (2.2 mi) from shore at a depth of 1.1 km (0.68 mi). It consists of 192 optical modules.[91]

Economy[edit]
Baikal fishermen fish for 15 commercially used species. The omul, found only in Baikal, accounts for most of the catch.[92]
The lake, nicknamed ""the Pearl of Siberia"", drew investors from the tourist industry as energy revenues sparked an economic boom.[93] Viktor Grigorov's Grand Baikal in Irkutsk is one of the investors, who planned to build three hotels, creating 570 jobs. In 2007, the Russian government declared the Baikal region a special economic zone. A popular resort in Listvyanka is home to the seven-story Hotel Mayak. At the northern part of the lake, Baikalplan (a German NGO) built together with Russians in 2009 the Frolikha Adventure Coastline Track, a 100 km (62 mi)-long long-distance trail as an example for sustainable development of the region. Baikal was also declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996. Rosatom plans to build a laboratory near Baikal, in conjunction with an international uranium plant and to invest $2.5 billion in the region and create 2,000 jobs in the city of Angarsk.[93]
Lake Baikal is a popular destination among tourists from all over the world. According to the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, in 2013, 79,179 foreign tourists visited Irkutsk and Lake Baikal; in 2014, 146,937 visitors. The most popular places to stay by the lake are Listvyanka village, Olkhon Island, Kotelnikovsky cape, Baykalskiy Priboi, resort Khakusy and Turka village. The popularity of Lake Baikal is growing from year to year, but there is no developed infrastructure in the area.
The ice road to Olkhon Island is the only legal ice road on Lake Baikal. The route is prepared by specialists every year and it opens when the ice conditions allow it. In 2015, the ice road to Olkhon was open from 17 February to 23 March. The thickness of the ice on the road is about 60 cm (24 in), maximum capacity allowed – 10 t (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons); it is open to the public from 9 am to 6 pm. The road through the lake is 12 km (7.5 mi) long and it goes from the village Kurkut on the mainland to Irkutskaya Guba on Olkhon Island.[94]

Ecotourism[edit]
Cracks in Baikal ice
Baikal has a number of different tourist activities, depending on the season. Generally, Baikal has two top tourist seasons. The first season is ice season, which starts usually in mid-January and lasts till mid-April.[95] During this season ice depth increases up to 140 centimeters, that allows safe vehicle driving on the ice cover (except heavy vehicles, such as tourist buses, that do not take this risk). This allows access to the figures of ice that are formed at rocky banks of Olkhon Island, including Cape Hoboy, the Three Brothers rock, and caves to the north of Khuzhir. It also provides access to small islands like Ogoy Island and Zamogoy.
The ice itself has a transparency of one meter depth.[citation needed] That is why this season is popular for hiking, ice-walking, ice-skating, and bicycle riding.[96] An ice route around Olkhon is around 200 km. Some tourists may spot a Baikal seal along the route. Local entrepreneurs offer overnight in yurt on ice.
The ice season ends in mid-April. Owing to increasing temperatures ice starts to melt and becomes shallow and fragile, especially in places with strong under-ice flows. A range of factors contribute to an increased risk of falling through the ice towards the end of the season, resulting in multiple deaths in Russia each year, although exact data for Baikal are unknown.[97] Viktor Viktorovych Yanukovych, son of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, reportedly died after his car fell through the ice while driving on Baikal in 2015.[98][99]
The second tourist season is summer, which lets tourists dive deeper into virgin Baikal nature. Hiking trails become open,[100] many of them cross two mountain ranges: Baikal Range on the western side and Barguzin Range on the eastern side of Baikal.
Small tourist vessels operate in the area, availing bird-watching, animal-watching (especially Baikal seal), and fishing. Water in the lake stays extremely cold in most places (does not exceed 10 C most of the year), but in a few gulfs like Chivirkuy, it can be comfortable for swimming.[101]

Great Baikal Trail goes from Listvyanka to Bolshoe Goloustnoye along Lake Baikal coast
Olkhon's most-populated village Khuzhir is an ecotourist destination.[102] Baikal has always been popular in Russia and CIS-countries, but for the last few years[when?] Baikal has seen an influx of visitors from China and Europe.[103]

Environmental concerns[edit]
Environmentalists have previously acknowledged pollution at Lake Baikal.[104][105][106] It faces a series of detrimental phenomena including the disappearance of the omul fish, the rapid growth of putrid algae and the death of endemic species of sponges across its area.[106] Environmental advocacy for the lake began in the late 1950s.[107] Since 2010, more than 15,000 metric tons of toxic waste have flowed into the lake.

Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill[edit]
Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill in 2008, 5 years before its 2013 closure
The Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill was constructed in 1966, directly on the shoreline of Lake Baikal. The plant bleached paper using chlorine and discharged waste directly into Lake Baikal. The decision to construct the plant on Lake Baikal resulted in strong protests from Soviet scientists; according to them, the ultra-pure water of the lake was a significant resource and should have been used for innovative chemical production (for instance, the production of high-quality viscose for the aeronautics and space industries). The Soviet scientists felt that it was irrational to change Lake Baikal's water quality by beginning paper production on the shore. It was their position that it was also necessary to preserve endemic species of local biota, and to maintain the area around Lake Baikal as a recreation zone.[108] However, the objections of the Soviet scientists faced opposition from the industrial lobby and only after decades of protest, the plant was closed in November 2008 due to unprofitability.[109][110]
On 4 January 2010, production was resumed. On 13 January 2010, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin introduced changes in legislation legalising the operation of the plant; this action brought about a wave of protests from ecologists and local residents.[111] These changes were based on the determination Prime Minister Putin made through a visual verification of Lake Baikal's condition from a miniature submarine, where he said: ""I could see with my own eyes – and scientists can confirm – Baikal is in good condition and there is practically no pollution"".[112] Despite this, in September 2013, the mill underwent a final bankruptcy, with the last 800 workers slated to lose their jobs by 28 December 2013.[113] The mill has since shut down, though its reservoirs of lignin sludge remain an environmental hazard.[114][115]

Cancelled East Siberia–Pacific Ocean oil pipeline[edit]

Main article: Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean oil pipeline
Russian oil pipelines state company Transneft[116] was planning to build a trunk pipeline that would have come within 800 m (2,600 ft) of the lake shore in a zone of substantial seismic activity. Environmental activists in Russia,[117] Greenpeace, Baikal pipeline opposition[118] and local citizens[119] were strongly opposed to these plans, due to the possibility of an accidental oil spill that might cause significant damage to the environment. According to the Transneft's president, numerous meetings with citizens near the lake were held in towns along the route, especially in Irkutsk.[120] Transneft agreed to alter its plans when Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the company to consider an alternative route 40 kilometers (25 mi) to the north to avoid such ecological risks.[121] Transneft has since decided to move the pipeline away from Lake Baikal, so that it will not pass through any federal or republic natural reserves.[122][123] Work began on the pipeline two days after President Putin agreed to changing the route away from Lake Baikal.[124]

Proposed uranium enrichment center[edit]
In 2006, the Russian government announced plans to build the world's first international uranium enrichment center at an existing nuclear facility in Angarsk, a city on the river Angara some 95 km (59 mi) downstream from the lake's shores. Critics and environmentalists argued it would be a disaster for the region and are urging the government to reconsider.[125]
After enrichment, only 10% of the uranium-derived radioactive material would be exported to international customers,[125] leaving 90% near the Lake Baikal region for storage. Uranium tailings contain radioactive and toxic materials, which if improperly stored, are potentially dangerous to humans and can contaminate rivers and lakes.[125]
An enrichment center was constructed in the 2010s.[126]

Chinese-owned bottled water plant[edit]
Chinese-owned AquaSib had been purchasing land alongside the lake and in 2019 started building a bottling plant and pipeline in the town of Kultuk. The goal was to export 190 million liters of water to China even though the lake had been experiencing historically low water levels. This spurred protests by the local population that the lake would be drained of its water, at which point the local government halted the plans pending analysis.[127]

Other pollution sources[edit]
According to The Moscow Times and Vice, an increasing number of an invasive species of algae thrive in the lake from hundreds of tons of liquid waste, including fuel and excrement, regularly disposed into the lake by tourist sites, and up to 25,000 tons of liquid waste are disposed of every year by local ships.[128][129]

Historical traditions[edit]
An 1883 British map using the More Baikal (Baikal Sea) designation, rather than the conventional Ozero Baikal (Lake Baikal).
The first European to reach the lake is said to have been Kurbat Ivanov in 1643.[130]
In the past, the Baikal was referred to by many Russians as the ""Baikal Sea"" (море Байкал, More Baikal), rather than merely ""Lake Baikal"" (озеро Байкал, Ozero Baikal).[131]
This usage is attested already in the Life of Protopope Avvakum (1621–1682),[132] and on the late-17th-century maps by Semyon Remezov.[133] It is also attested in the famous song, now passed into the tradition, that opens with the words Славное море, священный Байкал (Glorious sea, [the] sacred Bajkal).
To this day, the strait between the western shore of the Lake and the Olkhon Island is called Maloye More (Малое море), i.e. ""the Little Sea"".
Lake Baikal is nicknamed ""Older sister of Sister Lakes (Lake Khövsgöl and Lake Baikal)"".[134]

According to 19th-century traveler T. W. Atkinson, locals in the Lake Baikal Region had the tradition that Christ visited the area:
The people have a tradition in connection with this region which they implicitly believe. They say ""that Christ visited this part of Asia and ascended this summit, whence he looked down on all the region around. After blessing the country to the northward, he turned towards the south, and looking across the Baikal, he waved his hand, exclaiming 'Beyond this there is nothing.'"" Thus they account for the sterility of Daouria, where it is said ""no corn will grow.""[135]


Lake Baikal has been celebrated in Russian folk songs. Two of these songs are known in Russia and its neighboring countries, such as Japan.

""Glorious Sea, Sacred Baikal"" (Славное мope, священный Байкал) is about a katorga fugitive. The lyrics as documented and edited in the 19th century by Dmitriy P. Davydov (1811–1888).[136] See ""Barguzin River"" for sample lyrics.
""The Wanderer"" (Бродяга) is about a convict who had escaped from jail and was attempting to return home from Transbaikal.[137] The lyrics were collected and edited in the 20th century by Ivan Kondratyev.
The latter song was a secondary theme song for the Soviet Union's second color film, Ballad of Siberia (1947; Сказание о земле Сибирской).

What is the GPT-3 model?,"GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI, a research company focused on artificial intelligence. It is a deep neural network that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. The model was trained on a dataset of over 570 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models ever created.

GPT-3 has a wide range of applications, including language translation, text summarization, and question-answering. It can be used to generate text in a variety of styles, including writing, conversation, and code. The model has been used in a number of research studies and has demonstrated impressive performance on a variety of tasks.

One of the key features of GPT-3 is its ability to generate text that is coherent and contextually appropriate. The model uses a variety of techniques to generate text, including attention mechanisms, recurrent neural networks, and transformer architecture. These techniques allow GPT-3 to understand the context in which it is being used and to generate text that is relevant to the input it receives.

GPT-3 has been trained on a large dataset of text from a variety of sources, including books, websites, and news articles. This training data has helped the model to develop a sophisticated understanding of language and to generate text that is accurate and fluent.

GPT-3 is available as a web service that can be used to generate text on demand. The service is free for academic and non-commercial use, and there are also paid plans available for commercial use. GPT-3 is an example of the increasing use of large language models in a variety of applications, and it demonstrates the potential of these models to transform the way we interact with computers and with each other.",True,https://platform.openai.com/docs/models,"

Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo[a] (né Adetokunbo;[b] born December 6, 1994) is a Greek and Nigerian professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His size, speed, strength, and country of origin have earned him the nickname ""Greek Freak"". He is widely regarded as one of the greatest power forwards of all time as well as one of the greatest players of all time.[2][3][4][5][6][7]
Born and raised in Athens to Nigerian parents, Antetokounmpo began playing basketball for the youth teams of Filathlitikos in Athens. In 2011, he began playing for the club's senior team before entering the 2013 NBA draft, where he was selected 15th overall by the Bucks. In 2016–17, he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics: total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.[8] He received the Most Improved Player award in 2017. Antetokounmpo has received nine All-Star selections, including being selected as an All-Star captain in 2019, 2020, 2023 and 2024 as he led the Eastern Conference in voting in these four years.
One of the most decorated players in NBA history,[9] Antetokounmpo won consecutive NBA Most Valuable Player Awards in 2019 and 2020, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players in NBA history to win two MVPs before turning 26. Along with his MVP award, he was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2020, becoming only the third player, after Michael Jordan (1988) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1994), to win both awards in the same season. In 2021, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to their first NBA championship since 1971 and was named Finals MVP.[10] The same year, he was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[11] The film Rise, based on the life of Antetokounmpo and his family, was released in 2022. In 2024, he led the Bucks to win the 2nd edition of the NBA Cup, where he  was named NBA Cup MVP.
For his sporting achievements in his discipline, on July 10, 2024, the Greek Olympic Committee designated him as the flag bearer for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, along with the Greek race walker Antigoni Drisbioti.[12]


Early life
As the son of immigrants from Nigeria,[13][14][15] Giannis Sina Ugo Adetokunbo[16][17] was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994.[18] His father was a soccer player and his mother was a high jumper in Nigeria. Three years earlier, they had moved from Lagos, leaving their firstborn son, Francis, under the care of his grandparents.[19] Adetokunbo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia[15] in a primarily Nigerian household.[20] His parents, as immigrants without work permits,[21] could not easily find work, so Giannis and his older brother Thanasis helped by hawking watches, handbags, and sunglasses in the streets.[22] In 2007, Adetokunbo started playing basketball.[23]
Although Adetokunbo and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically receive Greek citizenship as Greek nationality law follows jus sanguinis.[14] Growing up, he sometimes felt like an outsider to both the Greek and Nigerian communities in Athens due to his parents' heritage and different skin color in the former, and due to his lack of understanding of the Yoruba or Igbo languages in the latter.[24] For the first 18 years of his life, Adetokunbo could not travel outside the country and was effectively stateless, having no papers from Greece or Nigeria.[23] He was eventually issued Greek citizenship on May 9, 2013,[25] less than two months before the NBA draft.[23]
After gaining Greek citizenship, his official surname became Αντετοκούνμπο, the Greek transcription of Adetokunbo, which was then transliterated letter-for-letter and officially spelled on his Greek passport as Antetokounmpo.[26][27] Giannis is a Modern Greek variant of Ioannes (John).[28] Because many NBA fans could not pronounce his surname, he quickly became known as the ""Greek Freak"".[29][30] Antetokounmpo also holds Nigerian citizenship,[16] having received his Nigerian passport in 2015,[20] and as such possesses dual citizenship.[31][32] He has stated that he feels both Greek and Nigerian[24] and that he embraces both his Greek, as well as his African/Nigerian identity.[20]

Professional career
Filathlitikos (2011–2013)
Antetokounmpo played with the senior men's team of Filathlitikos in the semi-pro Greek B Basket League (Third Division) during the 2011–12 season.[33]
In December 2012, a few days after turning 18, Antetokounmpo signed a four-year deal with Spanish club CAI Zaragoza,[34] reportedly including NBA buyouts after each season. Several other major European clubs had been interested in adding him, including Barcelona and Anadolu Efes.[14]
During the 2012–13 Greek A2 League season, Antetokounmpo shot 46.4% from the field (62.1% on two-point field goals), 31.3% from three-point range, and 72.0% from the free throw line, while averaging 22.5 minutes per game. Over 26 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game.[35] He was also selected by the coaches as a special participant in the 2013 Greek League All-Star Game. Even though he was not selected as an all-star, the coaches let him play in the game as a treat for the fans, since he was in attendance at the game.[36] However, he did not get officially counted as an all-star selection, since only players that play in Greece's first division are even eligible to actually be voted to play in the game, and Antetokounmpo was playing in Greece's second division at the time.

Milwaukee Bucks (2013–present)
Early years in Milwaukee (2013–2016)
Antetokounmpo with the Bucks in November 2014
On April 28, 2013, Antetokounmpo officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft.[37] He fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks.[38][39]
Antetokounmpo made his NBA debut on October 13, 2013, at the age of 18 years, 311 days, as one of the youngest NBA players ever. He averaged 6.8 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks in 77 appearances during his rookie season. He scored in double figures 23 times and grabbed at least 10 rebounds twice, with both efforts resulting in double-doubles. He finished the season with 61 total blocks, which led all NBA rookies, and was the seventh-most by a Bucks rookie in franchise history. He was selected to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge at NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, where he tallied nine points, two rebounds, and two assists in 17 minutes. At the season's end, he was named to the 2013–14 NBA All-Rookie second team.[40]
Antetokounmpo's second season with the Bucks saw both individual and team development. On February 6, 2015, he recorded a then career-high 27 points and 15 rebounds in a loss to the Houston Rockets.[41] Three days later, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played February 2–8, earning Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career.[42] He later competed in the 2015 NBA Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star Weekend in New York. On March 9, he scored a then career-high 29 points on 11-of-16 shooting in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[43]
In the 2015–16 season, Antetokounmpo developed further individually, upping his scoring average to almost 17 points per game. On November 19, he scored a then career-high 33 points in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[44] On December 12, he recorded a near triple-double with 11 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists, helping the Bucks snap the Golden State Warriors' 24-game unbeaten start to the season with a 108–95 win.[45] On February 22, 2016, Antetokounmpo recorded his first career triple-double with 27 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 108–101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. At 21 years old, he became the youngest Buck to record a triple-double.[46][47]

First All-Star years (2016–2018)
Antetokounmpo with the Bucks in December 2016
On September 19, 2016, Antetokounmpo agreed to a four-year, $100 million contract extension with the Bucks.[48] Antetokounmpo's fourth year with the Bucks would be his breakout season, as he further increased his statistical output and ascended to stardom. On December 23, he had a then career-high 39 points, eight rebounds, and six assists in a 123–96 win over the Washington Wizards.[49] A couple of weeks later, Antetokounmpo recorded 27 points and 13 rebounds and made his first game-winning buzzer-beater, a 15-foot turnaround jumper which gave the Bucks a 105–104 victory over the New York Knicks.[50] With 25 points against the Knicks on January 6, Antetokounmpo had at least 20 points in his 14th consecutive game, matching the longest streak by a Bucks player since Michael Redd in 2006.[51] On January 19, Antetokounmpo was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[52] At 22 years and 74 days old, he became the youngest player in franchise history to start in an All-Star Game. He also became the first Greek NBA All-Star.[53] In the game, he led the East with 30 points in a 192–182 loss to the West.[54] On April 3, 2017, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in March. The award was the first of Antetokounmpo's career and the first for a Buck since Michael Redd won the award in January 2004.[55] Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks finish an Eastern Conference-best 14–4 in March, the franchise's first calendar month with at least 14 victories since going 16–2 in February 1971. Antetokounmpo led the Bucks in every one of the five major statistical categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) in the 2016–17 regular season, becoming only the fifth NBA player to do so after Dave Cowens, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, and LeBron James; Nikola Jokić has since matched it.[56] He also became the first player in NBA history to finish in the top 20 in the league in each of the five major categories in a regular season. As a result of his efforts, Antetokounmpo was named to the All-NBA Second Team, earning his first All-NBA honor.[57] He was also named the recipient of the NBA Most Improved Player Award for the 2016–17 season, becoming the first player in Bucks history to be named Most Improved Player.[58]
On April 15, 2017, Antetokounmpo scored a then playoff career-high 28 points in a 97–83 win over the third-seed Toronto Raptors in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series.[59] In Game 5 of the series on April 24, Antetokounmpo set a new playoff career-high with 30 points, but could not lead the Bucks to a win as they lost 118–93 to go down 3–2 in the series.[60] The Bucks went on to lose Game 6 three days later despite a 34-point effort from Antetokounmpo, ending their season.[61]

Antetokounmpo dunking against the Washington Wizards in 2018
Antetokounmpo began the 2017–18 season on a tear, scoring 175 points over the first five games of the season, including a then career-high 44 points in a 113–110 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.[62] He averaged almost 27 points during the season, earning his second straight All-Star nomination and All-NBA selection,[63] and broke Kareem Abdul Jabbar's franchise record for triple-doubles.
In Game 1 of the Bucks' first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics, Antetokounmpo recorded 35 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists in a 113–107 overtime loss.[64] Antetokounmpo's game-winning tip-in in Game 4 equalized the series at two games a piece. However, the Celtics would go on to eliminate the Bucks in seven games, in spite of Antetokounmpo's 22 points and nine rebounds in Game 7.[65]

Back-to-back MVP and DPOY award (2018–2020)
Starting from the 2018–19 season, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks achieved a period of sustained team success. Under new coach Mike Budenholzer, the Bucks began the season with seven consecutive victories and went 25–10 before the New Year.[66][67]
Antetokounmpo was critical to this early success, earning the Eastern Conference Player of the Month awards for October, November, December and February.[68][69][70] On March 17, Antetokounmpo scored a then career-high 52 points to go with 16 rebounds in a 130–125 loss to the 76ers.[71][72] He avenged this loss in an April 4 victory where he recorded 45 points and 13 rebounds in a 128–122 win over the 76ers, helping the Bucks clinch the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.[73] Antetokounmpo eventually guided the Bucks to a 60–22 season and the best record in the league. He helped the Bucks advance to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2001 after scoring 41 points in a 127–104 win in Game 4 over the Detroit Pistons for a four-game sweep.[74][75] The Bucks went on to reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the eventual champions, the Toronto Raptors, despite winning the first two games.[76] At the 2019 NBA Awards end-of-season night, Antetokounmpo was named the league's Most Valuable Player.[77] He joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the second Bucks player to win MVP and became the third youngest player to win the MVP over the previous 40 seasons, behind Derrick Rose and LeBron James.[78]
Antetokounmpo began the 2019–20 season with a triple-double, recording 30 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 117–111 season-opening win over the Houston Rockets on October 24, 2019.[79] On November 25, Antetokounmpo scored a season-high 50 points, along with 14 rebounds, in a 122–118 win over the Utah Jazz.[80] After a December 14 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, Antetokounmpo had led the Bucks to their 18th straight victory, 2 shy of the franchise record.[81] The winning streak ended on December 16 with a close loss to the Dallas Mavericks, despite Antetokounmpo recording an efficient 48 points and 14 rebounds.[82] On December 19, Antetokounmpo made a career-high five three-pointers to lead Milwaukee over the Western top seed, the Los Angeles Lakers and helped the Bucks claim the NBA's best record at 25–4. On January 23, 2020, Antetokounmpo was named an All-Star Game captain, alongside James, for the second consecutive year.[83][84]
During the season postponement that lasted from early March to the end of July, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Antetokounmpo claimed to not have a basketball hoop to practice with.[85] He later clarified that he did have access to a gym and basketball hoop, explaining his earlier comments as a means to ""get a little bit ahead of the competition.""[86] Antetokounmpo and the Bucks resumed their campaign against the Boston Celtics on July 31, where Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to victory with 36 points and 15 rebounds.[87] Although the Bucks finished the seeding games with a 3–5 record, they set the best record in the NBA for the second consecutive year, finishing with a 56–17 record. On August 12, Antetokounmpo was suspended for one game without pay for headbutting Moritz Wagner during a game against the Washington Wizards.[88] During the playoffs, the Bucks advanced to the second round but lost 4–1 to the Miami Heat. In Game 2, the Heat's Jimmy Butler was fouled while shooting by Antetokounmpo as time expired, leading to Butler's game-winning walk-off free throws.[89] Antetokounmpo missed most of Game 4 after re-injuring his right ankle which he twisted in Game 3. Milwaukee won the game, but Antetokounmpo was also out for Game 5, when the Bucks were eliminated.[90]
On September 18, 2020, Antetokounmpo won his second consecutive Most Valuable Player award. In doing so, he joined Hakeem Olajuwon and Michael Jordan as the only players to win MVP and NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same season.[91]

NBA championship and Finals MVP (2020–2021)
On December 15, 2020, Antetokounmpo re-signed with the Bucks, coming to terms on a 5-year, $228 million extension, the largest in league history.[92] At the 2021 All-Star Game, he played on the team captained by James and scored 35 points on a perfect 16-of-16 shooting from the field to lead the team to a 170–150 win and became the first non-American to win the All-Star MVP.[93] The Bucks finished the 2020–21 season with a 46–26 record, clinching the third seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced a rematch against the Miami Heat. In a stark reversal of their upset loss the prior year, Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to a four-game sweep, closing out the series with his first playoff triple-double in Game 4.[94] Antetokounmpo also led the Bucks to a seven-game series win over the Brooklyn Nets in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where he averaged 31.9 points, 12.9 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game. On June 29, 2021, Antetokounmpo suffered an injury to his left knee during the third quarter of Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks after slamming into Clint Capela and landing awkwardly, resulting in a gruesome hyperextension.[95] Antetokounmpo would not return to the game, and the Bucks lost 110–88.[96] MRI results would later show that he did not suffer any ligament tears.[97] Antetokounmpo was ruled out for both Games 5 and 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals as a result of the knee injury.[98][99] The series returned to Milwaukee at a 2–2 deadlock, yet the Bucks ended up winning both Games 5 and 6 in his absence, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in 47 years.[100]
Antetokounmpo returned in time for the finals against the resurgent Phoenix Suns.[101] In his Finals debut, he recorded 20 points and 17 rebounds in a 118–108 loss.[102] He then registered back-to-back games with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds in a Game 2 loss and a Game 3 victory,[103][104] joining Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 as the only players to reach those numbers in consecutive Finals games.[104] He also joined Jordan, O'Neal, and James as the only players to put up at least 40 points in back-to-back Finals games in the previous 50 years.[105] The Bucks continued their comeback after having lost the first two games of the series, prevailing in the next four contests. In Game 6, Antetokounmpo recorded 50 points, 14 rebounds and 5 blocks as the Bucks clinched their first championship in 50 years.[106][107] He posted series averages of 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.8 blocks, and was subsequently named NBA Finals MVP by a unanimous vote.[10] At 26 years, 226 days old, he is the youngest since Kawhi Leonard in 2014 to be named Finals MVP,[108] as well as the first European since Dirk Nowitzki in 2011 to do so.[109] Antetokounmpo also joined Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players to have won the MVP, Finals MVP, and Defensive Player of the Year awards during the span of their careers.[110]

He joined Shaquille O'Neal and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA playoff history to post a 40/20/5 game.[129][130] The Bucks would go on to lose to Celtics in Game 7 despite Antetokounmpo's 25-point, 20-rebound, and 9-assist outing. He became the first player in NBA history to have 200 points, 100 rebounds, and 50 assists in a playoff series, averaging 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds, and 7.1 assists against Boston. Antetokounmpo also finished the postseason by averaging 31.7 points, 14.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists across the 12 playoff games his Milwaukee Bucks played. He is therefore the first player in NBA history to average a 31-14-6 line across an entire postseason.[131][132]
On May 21, Antetokounmpo was selected to his fourth consecutive NBA All-Defensive First Team, which was the fifth career all-defensive team selection for him.

He tied John Havlicek and Draymond Green for 15th place on the NBA's all-time triple-double list. Antetokounmpo also became the first player to total 200+ points, 80+ rebounds, and 30+ assists over a 5-game span since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972.[144] On January 23, Antetokounmpo was named the Eastern Conference captain for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, which marked his seventh overall selection.[145] On January 29, Antetokounmpo posted 50 points and 13 rebounds while playing only 30 minutes in a 135–110 win over New Orleans Pelicans. He shot 20-of-26 from the field, 3-of-4 from three, 7-of-12 from the free throw line. This marked the 10th time this season that Antetokounmpo has scored at least 40 points, matching the career high he set last year for 40-point games in a single season.[146] On February 2, Antetokounmpo scored 20 of his 54 points in the fourth quarter, along with 19 rebounds and the Milwaukee Bucks overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 106–105 for their sixth consecutive victory.

In the first round of the 2023 NBA playoffs, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks faced the Miami Heat. In Game 1, Antetokounmpo suffered a lower back contusion that ruled him out for the remainder of Game 1, and the next two games.[156] He returned in Game 4, scoring a triple-double of 26 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a losing effort.[157] The Bucks were eliminated in five games, despite Antetokounmpo's 38-point, 20-rebound outing in a 128–126 closeout overtime loss in Game 5.[158]

National team career
Junior national team
Antetokounmpo represented Greece for the first time in July 2013 with the Greek Under-20 national team at the 2013 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. He helped Greece to an 8–2 record and a fifth-place overall finish while averaging 8.0 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 2.2 assists across the 10 games. He finished the tournament ranked second in defensive rebounds (7.0) and seventh in blocked shots (1.4).[18]

Senior national team
In 2014, Antetokounmpo played for the senior men's Greek national basketball team for the first time, helping Greece finish ninth overall in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup with a 5–1 record. He averaged 6.3 points and 4.3 rebounds across the six games while shooting 45.8% from the field.[182]
Antetokounmpo again joined the Greek national team for EuroBasket 2015. Greece's roster consisted of many experienced players, most of them previously crowned European champions with their clubs, like Vassilis Spanoulis, Ioannis Bourousis and Nikos Zisis, and Greece was a favorite for a medal, after showing great form in friendly games.[183] At EuroBasket 2015, Greece was unbeaten in the group stages, and reached the quarter-finals, where a tight game ended in favor of the eventual champions, Spain, eventually finishing fifth with a 7–1 record. Antetokounmpo finished the tournament with three double-doubles, and a career-high 17 rebounds against Spain, leading his team in rebounds for the tournament. In eight games, he averaged 9.8 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.[184]
Antetokounmpo also played with Greece at the 2016 Turin FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, where he averaged 15.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.7 steals, and 2.0 blocks per game in 3 games played.[185] Greece failed to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics, after being eliminated by Croatia, by a score of 66–61.[186] He also played with Greece during their preparation phase for the EuroBasket 2017. He scored 20 points in a prep game against Montenegro.[187] However, he missed the actual EuroBasket 2017 tournament, due to a knee injury.[188][189][190]
Antetokounmpo represented Greece at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, where he became the first reigning NBA MVP to play in a World Cup.[191] He averaged 14.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 2.4 steals, and 0.6 blocks per game, in 5 games played.[192] Greece finished 11th in the tournament after they failed to advance past the second round, which was regarded as a disappointing result in national and international sports media.[193][191]
He rejoined the team in August 2022. On August 25, 2022, Antetokounmpo scored a national team career-high 40 points, along with 8 rebounds and 5 assists, in a 94–100 overtime loss to Serbia in the 2023 World Cup qualifiers.[194]
In September, Antetokounmpo played in the EuroBasket 2022 with Greece, his second of such tournament. On September 6, Antetokounmpo scored 41 points in a 99–79 group stage win over Ukraine.[195] This was the twelfth-highest points tally of all time, and the most points scored in a EuroBasket game since Dirk Nowitzki in 2001.[196] Greece was eliminated by Germany in the quarter-finals, in a game in which Antetokounmpo had 31 points, 7 rebounds and 8 assists but was ejected after two unsportsmanlike fouls.[197] He averaged 29.3 points, 8.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 0.8 blocks per game in 6 games played, while shooting 56.6% from the field.[198] Antetokounmpo finished the tournament as the leading scorer and was selected to the All-Tournament Team.
At the 2024 Summer Olympics, he carried the Greek flag at the Opening Ceremonies. He subsequently represented Greece in group stage against Canada, Spain and Australia, eventually finishing third with a 1–2 record. Greece was eliminated by Germany in the quarter-finals, in a game in which Antetokounmpo scored 22 points. He averaged a tournament high 25.8 points along with 6.3 rebounds, 3.5 assists in 4 games played, while shooting 67.8% from the field.[199] For his performances, Antetokounmpo was named to the tournament's All-Second Team.[200]
From 2014 to 2024, Antetokounmpo played with the senior men's Greek national team in 37 official games, in major FIBA tournaments. In those specific games, he has scored a total of 725 points, for a scoring average of 19.6 points per game.[201]

Player profile
Antetokounmpo during the 2022 NBA All-Star Game
Standing 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) tall and weighing 242 pounds (110 kg), Antetokounmpo is officially listed as a forward and sometimes described as a point forward,[202][203][204] but has been deployed across all five positions. Highly athletic and versatile, Antetokounmpo is often recognized as one of the best all-around players in the NBA, and many analysts have declared him ""positionless"" and as embodying the future of the league.[205][206][207]

Offense
By the 2016–17 season, Antetokounmpo had established himself as one of the league's most devastating slashers and transition scorers.[207][208] His rare combination of size and speed frequently enables him to cross half a court in a single dribble and blowing past multiple defenders.[205][206][209] A 2017 analysis conducted by Stats SportVU at the behest of FiveThirtyEight showed that Antetokounmpo was able to cover slightly more than 15 feet off a single dribble when driving to the basket, 5 feet further than the average player in the league.[204] In addition, Antetokounmpo has developed his own version of the Euro step, described by Jordan Brenner of ESPN.com as ""the final phase of the move's evolution"", which allows him to directly attack the rim from the three-point arc in a move that ""renders the area between the top of the key and the basket all but undefendable"".[210]
However, Antetokounmpo has been criticized for his lack of a reliable jump shot, having shot above 31% from three-point range just once in his career. Antetokounmpo's jumper has been exploited by other teams. Most famously, the Toronto Raptors built a 'wall' of lengthy, adept defenders to neutralise Antetokounmpo's paint dominance in their 2019 Conference Finals victory.[211] As a result, Antetokounmpo increased his jump-shooting output, averaging a career-high 4.4 three-point goals attempted and 1.4 made per game in 2019–20.[202]
Antetokounmpo has also received attention for his playmaking skills. Despite not being the primary ball handler of the Bucks, he has largely orchestrated the team's offense. During the 2019–20 season, Antetokounmpo was responsible (through assisting and personally scoring) for 57.8% of the points the Bucks scored while he was on the floor, one of the highest rates in the league.[212] He averaged nearly 6 assists per game during both the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons.[202]

Defense
Antetokounmpo is also recognized as an elite defensive player, capable of guarding all five positions but more often deployed in a ""free safety"" role that allows him to roam the paint and discourage attacks on the rim.[213] He is also a proficient shot-blocker and has developed a reputation for blocking opponents in transition (the chase-down block).[214]
With Antetokounmpo in this role, the Bucks have flourished into one of the league's best defensive teams, leading the NBA in defensive rating in 2018–19 and 2019–20.[215][216] For his defensive efforts, Antetokounmpo won the 2020 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and he has become a perennial NBA All-Defensive honoree.[217]

Outside of basketball
In August 2022, Calamos Advisors announced that they would work with Antetokounmpo on an exchange-traded fund that invests in sustainable firms that would be called the Calamos Antetokounmpo Sustainable Equities Fund.[223]
In September 2022, Antetokounmpo joined as an executive producer for National Geographic's documentary The Flagmakers, which focuses on the large population of immigrant employees working at an American flag factory. Antetokounmpo called the project inspiring, saying: ""As an immigrant myself, I find this film incredibly personal and a deeply moving testament to those who call this country 'home'"".[224]

Personal life
Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo playing basketball at a local court in Sepolia, Athens, in 2015
Antetokounmpo's father, Charles, was a Nigerian football player, while his mother, Veronica, is a former high jumper.[19] Charles died in September 2017, at age 54.[62] Veronica gave each of her five sons both Greek and Nigerian names, choosing the Nigerian Ugo for Giannis.[225][226] His parents are from different Nigerian ethnic groups—Charles was Yoruba, while Veronica is Igbo. According to basketball great Hakeem Olajuwon, also Yoruba, the original family name of Adétòkunbọ̀ translates to ""the crown has returned from overseas"".[16] Giannis wears the number 34 in honor of his parents, who were born in 1963 and 1964.[227]
Antetokounmpo has two older brothers, Francis (Greek name Andreas) and Thanasis, as well as two younger brothers, Kostas and Alex.[228] Antetokounmpo is a Christian and was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church.[229] He was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church along with his brother Alex on October 28, 2012.[230]
Following their son and brother, the entire Antetokounmpo family, except for Francis and Thanasis, moved from Athens to Milwaukee in early 2014.[231] In July 2016, Giannis and Thanasis began their mandatory military service in Greece. The two brothers served a reduced three-month military service, as prescribed for Greek citizens who are permanent overseas residents.[232]
Thanasis made his NBA debut with the New York Knicks after being drafted by the organization with the 51st overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft.[233] After playing for Andorra during the 2016–17 season and the Greek EuroLeague powerhouse Panathinaikos for the next two seasons, he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks on July 16, 2019.[234] Antetokounmpo's younger brother, Kostas, played college basketball for Dayton before being selected with the last pick in the 2018 NBA draft.[235] He went on to win the 2020 NBA Championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2021, Kostas signed with ASVEL Basket, part of the French Betclic Élite and the EuroLeague.[236] He currently plays for Panathinaikos in Greece. Their youngest brother, Alex, played high school basketball in the US before becoming a professional basketball player.

In the mid-2010's, Antetokounmpo began dating Mariah Riddlesprigger, a native of Fresno, California.[237][238] In February 2020, Riddlesprigger gave birth to their first son, Liam.[239] She gave birth to a second son, Maverick, in August 2021,[240][241] and a daughter, Eva, in September 2023.[242] Antetokounmpo and Riddlesprigger got married in a private ceremony on September 1, 2024, at the Costa Navarino resort near Pylos.[243] Milwaukee Bucks teammate Khris Middleton served as the best man. 
On March 13, 2020, Antetokounmpo and his family pledged to give $100,000 to the staff of the Fiserv Forum who were unable to work during the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[244] Antetokounmpo and his family also donated 20,000 masks to people in Athens and Zografou in Greece in 2020.[245]
On August 20, 2021, Antetokounmpo became a minority owner of the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball.[246] Antetokounmpo also holds a passion for soccer, being a supporter of Italian football club Inter Milan.[247] In March 2023, Giannis, along with his brothers, Alex, Thanasis, and Kostas, became minority owners in the Major League Soccer club Nashville SC.[248]
In June 2023, Giannis and his brothers Thanasis, Kostas and Alex expanded their investment portfolio, overseen by Ante Inc., by becoming shareholders and owners of the Canadian online confectionary retailer, Candy Funhouse.[249]
In September 2023, Giannis signed on as an Executive Producer of a reality TV show created by Candy Funhouse and the producers of Big Brother, Fly on the Wall.[250]

What is the Zimbabwean Hyperinflation?,"Zimbabwe's hyperinflation is a period of extremely high inflation that occurred in the country from 2007 to 2009. It was caused by a number of factors, including a rapidly depreciating currency, a lack of foreign currency, and a high level of government spending.

Here are some specific details and examples of Zimbabwe's hyperinflation:

* In 2008, Zimbabwe's inflation rate reached over 80 million percent, making it the highest in the world.
* The Zimbabwean government introduced a new currency, the ""bond note,"" in an attempt to stabilize the economy. However, this caused even more inflation and led to widespread shortages of the new currency.
* The government also introduced a series of price controls, which led to shortages of essential goods and a black market for these goods.
* Zimbabwe's hyperinflation led to widespread poverty and economic instability. Many people were unable to afford basic necessities, and the country's economy was in shambles.

In addition to these specific details, Zimbabwe's hyperinflation is often cited as a significant example of the negative effects of inflation and hyperinflation on a country's economy and people.",False,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe,"

Period of currency instability


Zimbabwean banknotes ranging from 10 dollars to 100 billion dollars printed within a one-year period. The magnitude of the currency scalars signifies the extent of the hyperinflation.
Zimbabwe's inflation of almost 25,000% in 2007
Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe is an ongoing period of currency instability in Zimbabwe which, using Cagan's definition of hyperinflation, began in February 2007. During the height of inflation from 2008 to 2009, it was difficult to measure Zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics.  However, Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent month-on-month, 89.7 sextillion (

) percent year-on-year in mid-November 2008.[1]
In April 2009, Zimbabwe stopped printing its currency, and currencies from other countries were used.[2] In mid-2015, Zimbabwe announced plans to have completely switched to the United States dollar by the end of that year.[3]
In June 2019, the Zimbabwean government announced the reintroduction of the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar (RTGS), to be known simply as the ""Zimbabwe dollar"", and that all foreign currency was no longer legal tender.[4] By mid-July 2019, inflation had increased to 175%, sparking concerns that the country was entering another period of hyperinflation.[5][6] In March 2020, with inflation above 500% annually, a new task force was created to assess the currency problems.[7][8] By July 2020, annual inflation was estimated to be 737%.[9]


Historical context[edit]
On 18 April 1980, the Republic of Zimbabwe was born from the former Republic of Rhodesia. The Rhodesian dollar was replaced by the Zimbabwean dollar at par value. When Zimbabwe gained its independence from the United Kingdom, the newly introduced Zimbabwean dollar was initially more valuable than the United States dollar at the official exchange rate. However, that did not reflect reality because, in terms of purchasing power on the open and black markets, it was less valuable, due primarily to the higher inflation in Zimbabwe.[10][11] In its early years, Zimbabwe experienced strong growth and development. Wheat production for non-drought years was proportionally higher than previously, and the tobacco industry was thriving. Economic indicators for the country were strong.
From 1991 to 1996, the Zimbabwean ZANU–PF President Robert Mugabe embarked on an Economic Structural Adjustment Programme (ESAP) that had serious negative effects on Zimbabwe's economy. In the late 1990s, the government instituted land reforms in the name of anti-colonialism intended to evict white landowners and place their holdings in the hands of black farmers. However, many of the new farmers had no experience or training in agriculture.[12] Many farms simply fell into disrepair or were given to Mugabe loyalists. From 1999 to 2009, the country experienced a sharp drop in food production and in all other sectors. The banking sector also collapsed, with farmers unable to obtain loans for capital development. Food output fell 45%, and manufacturing output fell by 29% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 28% in 2007. Unemployment rose to 80%.[13] Life expectancy dropped.[14] Much of the nation's middle class fled the country en masse taking much of the nation's capital. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe blamed the hyperinflation on economic sanctions imposed by the United States of America, the IMF, and the European Union.[15][16] These sanctions affected the government of Zimbabwe,[17] asset freezes and visa denials targeted at 200 specific Zimbabweans closely tied to the Mugabe regime.[18] There were also restrictions placed on trade with Zimbabwe, by both individual businesses and the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.[19]

The largest denomination of a Zimbabwean banknote (Z$100,000,000,000,000, 1×1014, or 100 trillion)
A monetarist view[20] is that a general increase in the prices of things is less a commentary on the worth of those things than on the worth of the money. This has objective and subjective components:

Objectively, that the money has no firm basis to give it a value.
Subjectively, that the people holding the money lack confidence in its ability to retain its value.
Crucial to both components is discipline over the creation of additional money. However, the Mugabe government was printing money to finance military involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, in 2000, in the Second Congo War, including higher salaries for army and government officials. Zimbabwe was under-reporting its war spending to the International Monetary Fund by $22 million a month.[21]
Another motive for excessive money creation has been self-dealing. Transparency International ranks Zimbabwe's government 157th of 177[22] in terms of institutionalised corruption.[23] The resulting lack of confidence in government undermines confidence in the future and faith in the currency.
Economic missteps by government can create shortages and occupy people with workarounds rather than productivity. Though this harms the economy, it does not necessarily undermine the value of the currency, but may harm confidence in the future. Widespread poverty and violence, including government violence to stifle political opposition, also undermines confidence in the future.[24] Land reform lowered agricultural output, especially in tobacco, which accounted for one-third of Zimbabwe's foreign-exchange earnings. Manufacturing and mining also declined. An objective reason was, again, that farms were put in the hands of inexperienced people; and subjectively, that the move undermined the security of property.
Government instability and civic unrest were evident in other areas.[25] Zimbabwean troops, trained by North Korean soldiers, conducted a massacre in the 1980s in the southern provinces of Matabeleland and Midlands, though Mugabe's government cites guerrilla attacks on civilian and state targets. Conflicts between the Ndebele people and Mugabe's government have led to many clashes.[26] There was also unrest between black people and white people, in which the land reform was a factor. One aspect of this reform sought to discriminate against white people specifically and many were forced by the regime to sign over their businesses to the black majority.[27]
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe responded to the dwindling value of the dollar by repeatedly arranging the printing of further banknotes,[28][29][30][31][32] often at great expense from overseas suppliers. On 1 March 2008, it was reported that documents obtained by The Sunday Times showed that the Munich company Giesecke & Devrient (G&D) was receiving more than €500,000 (£381,562) a week for delivering bank notes equivalent to Z$170 trillion a week.[33][34] By late 2008, inflation had risen so high that ATMs for one major bank gave a ""data overflow error"" and stopped customers' attempt to withdraw money with so many zeros.[35]

Self-perpetuation[edit]
Also In Zimbabwe, neither the issuance of banknotes of higher denominations nor proclamation of new currency regimes led holders of the currency to expect that the new money would be more stable than the old. Remedies announced by the government never included a believable basis for monetary stability.[36][37] Thus, one reason the currency continued to lose value, causing hyperinflation, is that so many people expected it to.[38]

Over the course of the five-year span of hyperinflation, the inflation rate fluctuated greatly. At one point, the US Ambassador to Zimbabwe predicted that it would reach 1.5 million percent. In June 2008, the annual rate of price growth was 11.2 million percent. The worst of the inflation occurred in 2008, leading to the abandonment of the currency. The peak month of hyperinflation occurred in mid-November 2008 with a rate estimated at 79,600,000,000% per month, with the year-over-year inflation rate reaching an astounding 89.7 sextillion percent.[1] This resulted in US$1 becoming equivalent to Z$2,621,984,228.[39][40]
On 13 July 2007, the Zimbabwean government said that it had temporarily stopped publishing inflation figures, a move that observers said was meant to draw attention away from ""runaway inflation which has come to symbolise the country's unprecedented economic meltdown"".[41][42] In 2008, the inflation rate accelerated dramatically, from a rate in January of over 100,000%[43] to an estimated rate of over 1,000,000% by May,[44][45] and nearly 250,000,000% in July.[46] As predicted by the quantity theory of money, this hyperinflation was linked to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe increasing the money supply.[47]

Old Mutual Implied rate[edit]
As hyperinflation accelerated, the value of the Zimbabwean dollar declined rapidly against other currencies, yet official exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe were infrequently updated; this made it impossible to tell from an official source how much the Zimbabwe dollar was really worth against other currencies on a particular day, which in turn disrupted international business transactions involving Zimbabwe dollars. Staff from WM/Reuters devised an indirect means of measurement that was termed the Old Mutual Implied Rate (OMIR).[48] This took the daily price of Old Mutual shares traded in the London and Harare stock markets and used it to derive a national daily exchange rate between the Zimbabwe dollar and the pound.[49][50] Shares had much looser capital controls than the Zimbabwean banking system, so they were used as a vehicle for moving capital between currencies by buying stock in either London or Harare and then selling in the other location.
The Old Mutual Implied rate was a widely adopted benchmark rate for unofficial currency exchange until intervention by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in May 2008 prohibited the transfer out of the country of shares in Old Mutual, ABC and Kingdom Meikles Africa, thereby blocking their fungibility.

Adaptations[edit]
Use of foreign currencies[edit]
Selection of 16 original un-circulated Zimbabwe notes ranging in denomination from 1 dollar to 100 trillion dollars.  They are all signed by G Gono, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, in the period 2007 to 2008, who promises ""to pay the bearer on demand"". In 2007 Gideon Gono gained a PhD in Strategic Management from the Atlantic International University.
In 2007, the government declared inflation illegal. Anyone who raised the prices for goods and services was subject to arrest. This amounted to a price freeze, which is usually ineffective in halting inflation.[51] Officials arrested numerous corporate executives for changing their prices.[52]US banknotes, collected in Zimbabwe in 2015. Used as local currency. On display at the British Museum in London
In December 2008, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe licensed around 1,000 shops to deal in foreign currency.[53][54] Citizens had increasingly been using foreign currency in daily exchanges, as local shops stated the prices of few goods in Zimbabwe dollars,  because they needed foreign currency to import foreign goods. Many businesses and street vendors continued to do so without getting the license.[55]
In January 2009, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa lifted the restriction to use only Zimbabwean dollars.[citation needed] This acknowledged what many were already doing. Citizens were allowed to use the US dollar, the euro, and the South African rand. However, teachers and civil servants were still being paid in Zimbabwean dollars. Even though their salaries were in the trillions per month, this amounted to around US$1, or half the daily bus fare.[56] The government also used a restriction on bank withdrawals to try to limit the amount of money that was in circulation. It limited cash withdrawals to $Z500,000, around US$0.25.[57]

The black market[edit]
Official, black market, and OMIR exchange rates 1 Jan 2001 to 2 Feb 2009. Note the logarithmic scale.
Prices in shops and restaurants were still quoted in Zimbabwean dollars, but were adjusted several times a day. Any Zimbabwean dollars acquired needed to be exchanged for foreign currency on the parallel market immediately,[58] or the holder would suffer a significant loss of value. For example, mini-bus drivers were required by law to only accept payment from passengers in Zimbabwean dollars, but at increasing rates throughout the day: the evening commute was therefore the highest-priced ride of the day, with the next morning's price higher still. A driver might have to exchange money three times a day, not in banks but in back office rooms and in parking lots.[citation needed]
Such business venues constituted a black market, an arena explicitly outside the law. Transactors could evade the price freezes and the mandate to use Zimbabwean dollars. The black market served the demand for daily goods such as soap and bread, as grocery stores operating within the law no longer sold items whose prices were strictly controlled, or charged customers more if they were paying in Zimbabwean dollars.[59] At one point, a loaf of bread was Z$550,000,000 in the regular market, when bread was even available; apart from a trip to another country, the black market was the only option for almost all goods at up to Z$10,000,000,000 for a loaf of bread.[60] In May 2022, it was reported that the devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar's black market exchange rate, which is used in most financial transactions in the economy, has been driving up inflation in the country.[61]

Redenomination[edit]
At independence in 1980, the Zimbabwean dollar became the common currency. Originally, the paper notes were in denominations of Z$2, 5, 10 and 20, and coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents and Z$1. As larger bills were needed to pay for menial amounts, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe planned to print and circulate denominations of up to Z$10, 20, 50, and 100 trillion.[62] Announcements of new denominations were increasingly frequent; the Z$200000000 bill was announced just days after the printing of the Z$100000000 bills.
The government did not attempt to fight inflation with fiscal and monetary policy. By 2003, there were growing shortages.[63] In 2006, before hyperinflation reached its peak, the bank announced it would print larger bills to buy foreign currencies. The Reserve Bank printed Z$21 trillion dollars to pay off debts owed to the International Monetary Fund.[64]
On three occasions, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe redenominated its currency. First, in August 2006, the Reserve Bank recalled notes in exchange for new notes with three zeros slashed from the currency.[65] In July 2008, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, announced a new Zimbabwean dollar, this time with 10 zeros removed. The Z$10 billion would be redenominated to be Z$1.[66] This move was not just to slow inflation but also to make computations more manageable.[67]
A third redenomination, producing the ""fourth Zimbabwe dollar"", occurred in February 2009, and dropped 12 more zeros from the currency. It was thus worth 10 trillion trillion original dollars, as the three redenominations together reduced the value of an original dollar by 103 × 1010 × 1012 = 1025. Computers could not handle the amount of zeros such that other forms of money had to be used to act as normal money (bearer's cheques). Banks had to input a lesser amount on the deposit or withdrawal slip then would put a covering statement, such as ""multiply by 1000000 or add 10 zeros to your amount to get the real value"". The same was true for businesses as well and all traders.[citation needed]

Solutions[edit]
A solution effectively adopted by Zimbabwe was to adopt some foreign currency as official. To facilitate commerce, it is less important which currency is adopted than that the government standardise on a single currency. The US dollar, the euro, and the South African rand were candidates; the US dollar had the most credibility and was the most widely traded within Zimbabwe.[68] Zimbabwe could have joined the nearby nations of Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Eswatini, which constitute the Common Monetary Area, or ""Rand Zone""[10] by formally deciding to use the rand to promote trade and stability.[69]
In 2009, the government abandoned printing Zimbabwean dollars entirely.[68] This implicitly solved the chronic problem of lack of confidence in the Zimbabwean dollar, and compelled people to use the foreign currency of their choice. Since then Zimbabwe has used a combination of foreign currencies, mostly US dollars.
In 2014, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe unveiled ""convertible"" coins in denominations of US$0.01 through US$0.50 (Zimbabwean bond coins). The bank said that 80% of Zimbabweans use the US dollar, and said the local lack of coins induces retailers to round prices up to the next higher dollar. The coins extend the use of the dollar as a de facto currency, and indeed the National Bank repeatedly assured that it does not intend to bring back a national currency.[70] As of May 2016 the liquidity of the USD had rapidly decreased and John Mangudya, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, said Zimbabwe would print a new bond note, which he said would be at par with the American dollar.[71] This was to be done within the following two months. Some citizens disputed this, saying the 2008 error was now returning and they would not accept the bond notes.
The July 2018 inflation rate in Zimbabwe was officially 4.3% (up from 2.9% in June).[72][73] In June 2019, the official inflation rate was 97.9%.[4] In 2022, it was reported that the inflation rate quickened to 96.4% in April, from 60.6% in January. Zimbabwe's government ordered banks to stop lending with immediate effect. This move was designed to stop speculation against the Zimbabwean dollar and was part of a raft of measures to arrest its rapid devaluation on the black market. Other measures include an increased tax on forex bank transfers, higher levies on forex cash withdrawals above $1,000, and the payment of taxes which used to be charged in forex in local currency, according to Mnangagwa.[61]

Demonetization[edit]
In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said it would begin a process to ""demonetize"" (i.e., to officially value a fiat currency at zero). The plan was to have completed the switch to the US dollar by the end of September 2015.[3] In December 2015, Patrick Chinamasa, the Zimbabwe Minister of Finance, said they would make the Chinese yuan their main reserve currency and legal tender after China cancelled US$40 million in debts.[74] However, this was denied by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in January 2016.[75] In June 2016, nine currencies were legal tender in Zimbabwe but it was estimated 90% of transactions were in US dollars and 5% in Rand.[76]
In April 2023, the government announced the introduction of digital currencies backed by gold reserves. The digital money will be allowed to be transferred for people and business as a form of payment via e-gold wallets or e-gold cards.[77]

Return of hyperinflation[edit]
In 2019, the new Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube, presided over the conversion from foreign currency to a new Zimbabwean currency, and the resultant return of hyperinflation.[78][79][80] It was estimated that inflation reached 500% during 2019.[79][81] According to the website Trading Economics, the annual inflation rate in Zimbabwe was 540% in February 2020. The annual inflation rate had risen to 676% in March 2020, and there was a bleak economic outlook due to the effects of a drought in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic.[82] In 2022, the country experienced another period of high inflation, which jumped to 131.7% in May from 96.4% in April.[83] Since February 2022, Zimbabwe's inflation rate shot up from 66% to more than 130% in May 2022. By June 2022, it surged again to 191%.[84] The same month, Finance minister Mthuli Ncube said the GVT would not hesitate to intervene to cushion against price increases and exchange rate volatility.[85] In April 2024, a new currency was announced, the Zimbabwean ZiG.

"
What was the Enron scandal?,"The Enron scandal was a major financial fraud that occurred in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Enron was a large energy and services company that was based in Houston, Texas.

The scandal began in 2001 when the company's financial reports were found to be fraudulent. The reports showed that Enron's profits were much higher than they actually were, and that the company's assets were much larger than its liabilities.

The fraud was uncovered by several people, including Enron's own employees and outside auditors. The scandal quickly became a national news story, and Enron's stock price fell sharply.

Some of the specific details of the scandal include:

* Enron's CEO, Kenneth Lay, was one of the main figures in the scandal. Lay was convicted of fraud and conspiracy in 2006, and he died in 2006 before he could be sentenced.
* Enron's accounting practices were found to be fraudulent. The company used complex accounting methods to inflate its profits, and it also used off-balance sheet transactions to hide its debt.
* Enron's financial reports were found to be false. The company's profits were much higher than they actually were, and its liabilities were much larger than its assets.
* Enron's stock price fell sharply after the scandal was uncovered. The company's stock price fell from around $90 per share in 2000 to around $1 per share in 2001.
* Many of Enron's top executives were found to be involved in the fraud. A number of high-level executives were arrested and charged with fraud and conspiracy.

Overall, the Enron scandal was a major financial fraud that had a significant impact on the economy and the stock market. It is still remembered as one of the largest corporate frauds in history.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal,"

2001 accounting scandal


Enron logo
The Enron scandal was an accounting scandal sparked by American energy company Enron Corporation filing for bankruptcy after news of widespread internal fraud became public in October 2001, which led to the dissolution of its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, previously one of the five largest in the world. The largest bankruptcy reorganization in U.S. history at that time; Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure.[1]: 61 
Enron was formed in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, Lay developed a staff of executives that – by the use of accounting loopholes, the misuse of mark-to-market accounting, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices and pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.
Shareholders filed a $40 billion lawsuit, for which they were eventually partially compensated $7.2 billion, after the company's stock price plummeted from a high of US$90.75 per share in mid-1990s to less than $1 by the end of November 2001.[2]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until the WorldCom scandal the following year.[3]
Many executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and some were later sentenced to prison, including former CEO Jeffrey Skilling. Then CEO and Chairman Kenneth Lay was indicted and convicted, but died before being sentenced. Arthur Andersen LLC was found guilty of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation, which voided its license to audit public companies and effectively closed the firm. By the time the ruling was overturned at the Supreme Court, Arthur Andersen had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, and lost billions in pensions and stock prices.
As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies.[4] One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders.[5] The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.[4]


Rise of Enron[edit]
Kenneth Lay in a July 2004 mugshot
In 1985, Kenneth Lay merged the natural gas pipeline companies of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form a multi-billion dollar company. Just a year later, they then changed the name to Enron.[6]: 3  In the early 1990s, he helped to initiate the selling of electricity at market prices and soon after, Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets made it possible for traders such as Enron to sell energy at higher prices, thereby significantly increasing its revenue.[7] After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying on the part of Enron and others prevented such regulation. Enron changed from being a natural gas producer and supplier to a trader of energy derivative contracts with the assistance of Jeffrey Skilling, who joined the company as a consultant before rising to the position of chief operating officer.[7][8]
As Enron became the largest seller of natural gas in North America by 1992, its trading of gas contracts earned $122 million (before interest and taxes), the second largest contributor to the company's net income. The November 1999 creation of the EnronOnline trading website allowed the company to manage its contracts trading business better.[6]: 7 
In an attempt to achieve further growth, Enron pursued a diversification strategy. The company owned and operated a variety of assets including gas pipelines, electricity plants, paper plants, water plants, and broadband services across the globe. Enron also gained additional revenue by trading contracts for the same array of products and services it was involved.[6]: 5 
This included setting up power generation plants in developing countries and emerging markets including the Philippines (Subic Bay), Indonesia and India (Dabhol).[9]
The bull market of the 1990s helped to fuel Enron’s ambitions and contributed to its rapid growth. Enron's stock increased from the start of the 1990s until year-end 1998 by 311%, only modestly higher than the average rate of growth in the Standard & Poor 500 index.[6]: 1  However, the stock increased by 56% in 1999 and a further 87% in 2000, compared to a 20% increase and a 10% decrease for the index during the same years. By December 31, 2000, Enron's stock was priced at $83.13 and its market capitalization exceeded $60 billion, 70 times earnings and six times book value, an indication of the stock market's high expectations about its prospects. In addition, Enron was rated the most innovative large company in America in Fortune's Most Admired Companies survey.[6]: 1 

Causes of downfall[edit]
An Enron manual of ethics from July 2000, about a year before the company collapsed
Enron's complex financial statements were confusing to shareholders and analysts.[1]: 6 [10] When speculative business ventures proved disastrous, it used unethical practices to use accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and modify the balance sheet to indicate favorable performance.[6]: 9 
The combination of these issues later resulted in the bankruptcy of Enron, and the majority of them were perpetuated by the indirect knowledge or direct actions of Lay, Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and other executives such as Rebecca Mark. Lay served as the chairman of Enron in its last few years, and approved of the actions of Skilling and Fastow, although he did not always inquire about the details. Skilling constantly focused on meeting Wall Street expectations, advocated the use of mark-to-market accounting, accounting based on market value, which was then inflated, and pressured Enron executives to find new ways to hide its debt. Fastow and other executives ""created off-balance-sheet vehicles, complex financing structures, and deals so bewildering that few people could understand them.""[11]: 132–133 

Revenue recognition[edit]
Further information: Revenue recognition
Enron earned profits by providing services such as wholesale trading and risk management in addition to building and maintaining electric power plants, natural gas pipelines, storage, and processing facilities.[12] When accepting the risk of buying and selling products, merchants are allowed to report the selling price as revenues and the products' costs as the cost of goods sold. In contrast, an ""agent"" provides a service to the customer, but does not take the same risks as merchants for buying and selling. Service providers, when classified as agents, may report trading and brokerage fees as revenue, although not for the full value of the transaction.[13]: 101–103 
Although trading companies such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch used the conventional ""agent model"" for reporting revenue (where only the trading or brokerage fee would be reported as revenue), Enron instead elected to report the entire value of each of its trades as revenue. This ""merchant model"" was considered much more aggressive in the accounting interpretation than the agent model.[13]: 102  Enron's method of reporting inflated trading revenue was later adopted by other companies in the energy trading industry in an attempt to stay competitive with the company's large increase in revenue. Other energy companies such as Duke Energy, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy joined Enron in the largest 50 of the revenue-based Fortune 500 owing mainly to their adoption of the same trading revenue accounting as Enron.[13]: 105 
Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's revenues increased by more than 750%, rising from $13.3 billion in 1996 to $100.7 billion in 2000. This expansion of 65% per year was extraordinary in any industry, including the energy industry, which typically considered growth of 2–3% per year to be respectable. For just the first nine months of 2001, Enron reported $138.7 billion in revenues, placing the company at the sixth position on the Fortune Global 500.[13]: 97–100 
Enron also used creative accounting tricks and purposefully misclassified loan transactions as sales close to quarterly reporting deadlines, similar to the Lehman Brothers Repo 105 scheme in the 2008 financial crisis, or the currency swap concealment of Greek debt by Goldman Sachs. In Enron's case, Merrill Lynch bought Nigerian barges with an alleged buyback guarantee by Enron shortly before the earnings deadline. According to the government, Enron misreported a bridge loan as a true sale, then bought back the barges a few months later. Merrill Lynch executives were tried and in November 2004 convicted for aiding Enron in fraudulent accounting activities.[14] These charges were thrown out on appeal in 2006, after the Merrill Lynch executives had spent nearly a year in prison, with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans calling the conspiracy and wire fraud charges ""flawed"". Expert observers said that the reversal was highly unusual for the 5th Circuit, commenting that the conviction must have had serious issues in order to be overturned.[15] The Justice Department decided not to retry the case after the reversal of the verdict.[16][17]

Mark-to-market accounting[edit]
Further information: Mark-to-market accounting
In Enron's natural gas business, the accounting had previously been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed the actual costs of supplying the gas and actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined Enron, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, claiming that it would represent ""true economic value"".[11]: 39–42  Enron became the first nonfinancial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts.[18] Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract has been signed, income is estimated as the present value of net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate.[6]: 10  Owing to the large discrepancies between reported profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. Under this method, income from projects could be recorded, although the firm might never have received the money, with this income increasing financial earnings on the books. However, because in future years the profits could not be included, new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors.[11]: 39–42  As one Enron competitor stated, ""If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income.""[18] Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992.[11]: 39–42  However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.[11]: 127 
For one contract, in July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video signed a 20-year agreement to introduce on-demand entertainment to various U.S. cities by year's end. After several pilot projects, Enron claimed estimated profits of more than $110 million from the deal, even though analysts questioned the technical viability and market demand for the service.[6]: 10  The parties withdrew from the contract in March 2001,[19] but Enron continued to claim future profits, even though the deal resulted in a loss.[20]

Special purpose entities[edit]
Further information: Special purpose entity
Enron used special purpose entities—limited partnerships or companies created to fulfill a temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific assets. The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of ""special purpose entities"".[6]: 11  These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing. For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity from the sponsor. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt.[6]: 10  The company used a number of special purpose entities, such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) in the Apache deal, real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the Cochise deal.[21]
The special purpose entities were Tobashi schemes used for more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated.[6]: 11  Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious to the fact that the special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk.[6]: 11 

JEDI and Chewco[edit]
Main article: Chewco
In 1993, Enron established a joint venture in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI).[11]: 67  In 1997, Skilling, serving as Enron's chief operating officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS was interested in the idea, but only if it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI.[1]: 30  However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments, a limited partnership (L.P.) that raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million.[6]: 11  Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.
In autumn of 2001, CalPERS and Enron's arrangement was discovered, which required the discontinuation of Enron's prior accounting method for Chewco and JEDI. This disqualification revealed that Enron's reported earnings from 1997 to mid-2001 would need to be reduced by $405 million and that the company's indebtedness would increase by $628 million.[1]: 31 

Whitewing[edit]
Whitewing was the name of a special purpose entity used as a financing method by Enron.[22] In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments.[23] Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.[24]

LJM and Raptors[edit]
Main article: LJM (company)
In 1999, Fastow formulated two limited partnerships: LJM Cayman. L.P. (LJM1) and LJM2 Co-Investment L.P. (LJM2), to buy Enron's poorly performing stocks and stakes to improve its financial statements. LJM 1 and 2 were created solely to serve as the outside equity investor needed for the special purpose entities that were being used by Enron.[1]: 31  Fastow had to go before the board of directors to receive an exemption from Enron's code of ethics (as he had the title of CFO) in order to manage the companies.[11]: 193, 197  The two partnerships were funded with around $390 million provided by Wachovia, J.P. Morgan Chase, Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup, and other investors. Merrill Lynch, which marketed the equity, also contributed $22 million to fund the entities.[1]: 31 
Enron transferred to ""Raptor I-IV"", four LJM-related special purpose entities named after the velociraptors in Jurassic Park, more than ""$1.2 billion in assets, including millions of shares of Enron common stock and long-term rights to purchase millions more shares, plus $150 million of Enron notes payable"" as disclosed in the company's financial statement footnotes.[25][1]: 33 [26] The special purpose entities had been used to pay for all of this using the entities' debt instruments. The footnotes also declared that the instruments' face amount totaled $1.5 billion, and the entities notional amount of $2.1 billion had been used to enter into derivative contracts with Enron.[1]: 33 
Enron capitalized the Raptors, and, in a manner similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount.[1]: 38  This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen, as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.[27]
Eventually, the derivative contracts worth $2.1 billion lost significant value. Swaps were established at the time the stock price achieved its maximum. During the ensuing year, the value of the portfolio under the swaps fell by $1.1 billion as the stock prices decreased (the loss of value meant that the special purpose entities technically now owed Enron $1.1 billion by the contracts). Enron, using its mark-to-market accounting method, claimed a $500 million gain on the swap contracts in its 2000 annual report. The gain was responsible for offsetting its stock portfolio losses and was attributed to nearly a third of Enron's earnings for 2000 (before it was properly restated in 2001).[1]: 39 

Corporate governance[edit]
Further information: Corporate governance
On paper, Enron had a model board of directors comprising predominantly outsiders with significant ownership stakes and a talented audit committee. In its 2000 review of best corporate boards, Chief Executive included Enron among its five best boards.[28]: 21  Even with its complex corporate governance and network of intermediaries, Enron was still able to ""attract large sums of capital to fund a questionable business model, conceal its true performance through a series of accounting and financing maneuvers, and hype its stock to unsustainable levels.""[6]: 4 

Executive compensation[edit]
Although Enron's compensation and performance management system was designed to retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, in order to get a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.[13]: 112 
Enron was constantly emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, similar to other U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to give the appearance of reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations.[29] Stock tickers were installed in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers.[11]: 187  At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking, ""What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?"" and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible.[11]: 127  On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million shares outstanding as stock option plans (approximately 13% of common shares outstanding). Enron's proxy statement stated that, within three years, these awards were expected to be exercised.[6]: 13  Using Enron's January 2001 stock price of $83.13 and the directors' beneficial ownership reported in the 2001 proxy, the value of director stock ownership was $659 million for Lay, and $174 million for Skilling.[28]: 21 
Skilling believed that if Enron employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original thinking.[11]: 119  As a result, extravagant spending was rampant throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes twice as much as competitors.[11]: 401  In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.[11]: 241 

Risk management[edit]
Further information: Risk management
Before its demise, Enron was lauded for its sophisticated financial risk management tools.[30] Risk management was crucial to Enron not only because of its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments that needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices.[31]: 1171  Enron's downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities that it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.[28]: 17 
Enron's aggressive accounting practices were not hidden from the board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions.[31]: 1170  Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's finance committee and board did not have enough experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.[31]: 1175 

Financial audit[edit]
Further information: Financial audit
Enron's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, was accused of applying reckless standards in its audits because of a conflict of interest over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.[6]: 15 
Enron hired numerous Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) as well as accountants who had worked on developing accounting rules with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The accountants searched for new ways to save the company money, including capitalizing on loopholes found in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the accounting industry's standards. One Enron accountant revealed ""We tried to aggressively use the literature [GAAP] to our advantage. All the rules create all these opportunities. We got to where we did because we exploited that weakness.""[11]: 142 
Andersen's auditors were pressured by Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges from the special purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where the value of the entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen.[11]: 148  Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of SEC investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, leading to accusations of a cover-up.[6]: 15 [32][11]: 383 
Revelations concerning Andersen's overall performance led to the break-up of the firm, and to the following assessment by the Powers Committee (appointed by Enron's board to look into the firm's accounting in October 2001): ""The evidence available to us suggests that Andersen did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in connection with its audits of Enron's financial statements, or its obligation to bring to the attention of Enron's Board (or the Audit and Compliance Committee) concerns about Enron's internal contracts over the related-party transactions"".[33]

Audit committee[edit]
Corporate audit committees usually meet just a few times during the year, and their members typically have only modest experience with accounting and finance. Enron's audit committee had more expertise than many others. It included:[34]

Robert K. Jaedicke, an accounting professor at Stanford University and former dean of Stanford Business School
John Mendelsohn, President of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
Paulo Pereira, former president and CEO of the State Bank of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil
John Wakeham, former United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury
Ronnie Chan, Chairman of Hong Kong Hang Lung Group
Wendy Gramm, former Chair of U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Enron's audit committee was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover large amounts of material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met for an hour and a half. Enron's audit committee did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee.[6]: 14  The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.[35]

Ethical and political analyses[edit]
Commentators attributed the mismanagement behind Enron's fall to a variety of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism.[36][37][38][39][40] Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight.[41][42]

Other accounting issues[edit]
Enron made a habit of booking costs of cancelled projects as assets, with the rationale that no official letter had stated that the project was cancelled. This method was known as ""the snowball"", and although it was initially dictated that such practices be used only for projects worth less than $90 million, it was later increased to $200 million.[11]: 77 
In 1998, when analysts were given a tour of the Enron Energy Services office, they were impressed with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was.[11]: 179–180  This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.[citation needed]

Speculative business ventures[edit]
Enron division Azurix, slated for an IPO, initially planned to bid between $321 million and $353 million for the rights to operate water system services for areas around Buenos Aires. This was at the high end of what Enron's Risk Assessment and Control Group advised. But as pressure to outbid all others and win the deal grew more intense with the approaching IPO, the Azurix executives decided to up their bid. They eventually bid $438.6 million, which turned out to be about twice as much as the next highest sealed bid. But when Enron executives arrived at the Argentine facilities, they found them in shambles, with all of the customer records destroyed.[43]

Timeline of downfall[edit]


At the beginning of 2001, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.


—A. Berenson and R. A. Oppel, Jr. The New York Times, October 28, 2001.[44]

On September 20, 2000, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal bureau in Dallas wrote a story about how mark-to-market accounting had become prevalent in the energy industry. He noted that outsiders had no real way of knowing the assumptions on which companies that used mark-to-market based their earnings. While the story only appeared in the Texas Journal, the Texas regional edition of the Journal, short-seller Jim Chanos happened to read it and decided to check Enron's annual ""10-K"" financial report for himself. Chanos did not think it made sense that Enron's broadband unit appeared to far outpace a then-troubled broadband industry. He also noticed that Enron was spending much of its invested capital, and was alarmed by the large amounts of stock being sold by insiders. In November 2000, he decided to short Enron's stock.[11]: 334–338 
In February 2001, Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey told budget managers: ""From an accounting standpoint, this will be our easiest year ever. We've got 2001 in the bag.""[11]: 299  On March 5, Bethany McLean's Fortune article ""Is Enron Overpriced?"" questioned how Enron could maintain its high stock value, which was trading at 55 times its earnings, arguing that analysts and investors did not know exactly how the company made money.[45] McLean was first drawn to the company's financial situation after Chanos suggested she view the company's 10-K for herself.[11]: 338  In a post-mortem interview with The Washington Post, she recalled finding ""strange transactions"", ""erratic cash flow"", and ""huge debt"". The debt was the biggest red flag to McLean; she wondered how a supposedly profitable company could be ""adding debt at such a rapid rate"".[46] Later, in her book, The Smartest Guys in the Room, McLean recalled speaking off the record with a number of people in the investment community who were growing skeptical about Enron.[11]: 338 
McLean telephoned Skilling to discuss her findings prior to publishing the article, but he called her ""unethical"" for not properly researching his company.[47] Fastow claimed that Enron could not reveal earnings details as the company had more than 1,200 trading books for assorted commodities and did ""... not want anyone to know what's on those books. We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money.""[45]
In a conference call on April 17, 2001, then-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman,[48] who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practices during a recorded conference call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling stammered, ""Well uh ... Thank you very much, we appreciate it ... Asshole.""[49] This became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness, with slogans such as, ""Ask Why, Asshole"", a variation on Enron's official slogan ""Ask why"".[50]
By the late 1990s Enron's stock was trading for $80–90 per share, and few seemed to concern themselves with the opacity of the company's financial disclosures. In mid-July 2001, Enron reported revenues of $50.1 billion, almost triple year-to-date, and beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share.[51] Despite this, Enron's profit margin had stayed at a modest average of about 2.1%, and its share price had decreased by more than 30% since the same quarter of 2000.[51]
As time passed, a number of serious concerns confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large gas-powered power plant in India that had been mired in controversy since the beginning in relation to its high pricing and bribery at the highest level.[9] These were subsequently confirmed in the 2002 Senate investigation.[52]  There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.[citation needed]



There are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve issues, no previously unknown problem issues. I think I can honestly say that the company is probably in the strongest and best shape that it has probably ever been in.


—Kenneth Lay answering an analyst's question on August 14, 2001.[11]: 347 

On August 14, Skilling announced he was resigning his position as CEO after only six months citing personal reasons.[53] Observers noted that in the months before his exit, Skilling had sold at minimum 450,000 shares of Enron at a value of around $33 million (though he still owned over a million shares at the date of his departure).[53] Nevertheless, Lay, who was serving as chairman at Enron, assured surprised market watchers that there would be ""no change in the performance or outlook of the company going forward"" from Skilling's departure.[53] Lay announced he himself would re-assume the position of chief executive officer.[citation needed]
On August 15, Sherron Watkins, vice president for corporate development, sent an anonymous letter to Lay warning him about the company's accounting practices. One statement in the letter said: ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals.""[54] Watkins contacted a friend who worked for Arthur Andersen and he drafted a memorandum to give to the audit partners about the points she raised. On August 22, Watkins met individually with Lay and gave him a six-page letter further explaining Enron's accounting issues. Lay questioned her as to whether she had told anyone outside of the company and then vowed to have the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, review the issues, despite Watkins arguing that using the law firm would present a conflict of interest.[11]: 357 [55] Lay consulted with other executives, and although they wanted to dismiss Watkins (as Texas law did not protect company whistleblowers), they decided against it to prevent a lawsuit.[11]: 358  On October 15, Vinson & Elkins announced that Enron had done nothing wrong in its accounting practices as Andersen had approved each issue.[56]

Investors' confidence declines[edit]


Something is rotten with the state of Enron.


—The New York Times, September 9, 2001.[57]

By the end of August 2001, his company's stock value still falling, Lay named Greg Whalley, president and COO of Enron Wholesale Services, to succeed Skilling as president and COO of the entire company. He also named Mark Frevert as vice chairman, and appointed Whalley and Frevert  to positions in the chairman's office. Some observers suggested that Enron's investors were in significant need of reassurance, not only because the company's business was difficult to understand (even ""indecipherable"")[57] but also because it was difficult to properly describe the company in financial statements.[58] One analyst stated ""it's really hard for analysts to determine where [Enron] are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money.""[58] Lay accepted that Enron's business was very complex, but asserted that analysts would ""never get all the information they want"" to satisfy their curiosity. He also explained that the complexity of the business was due largely to tax strategies and position-hedging.[58] Lay's efforts seemed to meet with limited success; by September 9, one prominent hedge fund manager noted that ""[Enron] stock is trading under a cloud.""[57] The sudden departure of Skilling combined with the opacity of Enron's accounting books made proper assessment difficult for Wall Street. In addition, the company admitted to repeatedly using ""related-party transactions"", which some feared could be too easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on Enron's own balance sheet. A particularly troubling aspect of this technique was that several of the ""related-party"" entities had been or were being controlled by CFO Fastow.[57]
After the September 11 attacks, media attention shifted away from the company and its troubles. A little less than a month later, Enron announced its intention to begin the process of selling its lower-margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas and electricity trading. This policy included selling Portland General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, for about $1.9 billion in cash and stock, and possibly selling its 65% stake in the Dabhol project in India.[59]

Restructuring losses and SEC investigation[edit]
On October 16, 2001, Enron announced that restatements to its financial statements for years 1997 to 2000 were necessary to correct accounting violations. The restatements for the period reduced earnings by $613 million (or 23% of reported profits during the period), increased liabilities at the end of 2000 by $628 million (6% of reported liabilities and 5.5% of reported equity), and reduced equity at the end of 2000 by $1.2 billion (10% of reported equity).[6]: 11  Additionally, in January Skilling had asserted that the broadband unit alone was worth $35 billion, a claim also mistrusted.[60] An analyst at Standard & Poor's said, ""I don't think anyone knows what the broadband operation is worth.""[60]
Enron's management team claimed the losses were mostly due to investment losses, along with charges such as about $180 million in money spent restructuring the company's troubled broadband trading unit. In a statement, Lay said, ""After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses.""[60] Some analysts were unnerved. David Fleischer at Goldman Sachs, an analyst termed previously 'one of the company's strongest supporters' asserted that the Enron management ""... lost credibility and have to reprove themselves. They need to convince investors these earnings are real, that the company is for real and that growth will be realized.""[60][61]
Fastow disclosed to Enron's board of directors on October 22 that he earned $30 million from compensation arrangements when managing the LJM limited partnerships. That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as ""some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen"".[62] Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of ""share settled costless collar arrangements"", ""derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts,"" and strategies that served ""to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets."" Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business.[62] Regarding the SEC investigation, chairman and CEO Lay said, ""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest.""[62]
Two days later, on October 25, Fastow was removed as CFO, despite Lay's assurances as early as the previous day that he and the board had confidence in him. In announcing Fastow's ouster, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO.""[63] The move came after several banks refused to issue loans to Enron as long as Fastow remained CFO.[43] However, with Skilling and Fastow now both departed, some analysts feared that revealing the company's practices would be made all the more difficult.[63] Enron's stock was now trading at $16.41, having lost half its value in a little more than a week.[63]
Jeff McMahon, head of industrial markets, succeeded Fastow as CFO. His first task was to deal with a cash crisis. A day earlier, Enron discovered that it was unable to roll its commercial paper, effectively losing access to several billion dollars in financing. The company had actually experienced difficulty selling its commercial paper for a week, but was now unable to sell even overnight paper.[43] On October 27 the company began buying back all its commercial paper, valued at around $3.3 billion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its lines of credit at several banks. While the company's debt rating was still considered investment-grade, its bonds were trading at levels slightly less, making future sales problematic.[64] It soon emerged that Fastow had been so focused on creating off-balance sheet vehicles that he had all but ignored some of the most rudimentary aspects of corporate finance. McMahon and a ""financial SWAT team"" put together to find a way out of the cash crisis discovered that under Fastow's watch, Enron only operated on a quarterly basis. Fastow never developed procedures for tracking cash or debt maturities that were common for companies of Enron's stature. For all intents and purposes, Enron was illiquid.[43][11]: 549 
As the month came to a close, serious concerns were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron.[65] Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some about the consequences of the company's possible bankruptcy.[44] Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.[44]

Credit rating downgrade[edit]
The main short-term danger to Enron's survival at the end of October 2001 seemed to be its credit rating. It was reported at the time that Moody's and Fitch, two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible downgrade.[44] Such a downgrade would force Enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed, which would decrease the value of existing stock further. Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance for future transactions.[44]
Analysts and observers continued their complaints regarding the difficulty or impossibility of properly assessing a company whose financial statements were so cryptic. Some feared that no one at Enron apart from Skilling and Fastow could completely explain years of mysterious transactions. ""You're getting way over my head"", said Lay during late August 2001 in response to detailed questions about Enron's business, a reaction that worried analysts.[44]
On October 29, responding to growing concerns that Enron might have insufficient cash on hand, news spread that Enron was seeking a further $1–2 billion in financing from banks.[66] The next day, as feared, Moody's lowered Enron's credit rating from Baa1 to Baa2, two levels above junk status. Standard & Poor's affirmed Enron's rating of BBB+, the equivalent of Moody's Baa1. Moody's also warned that it would downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.[67]
November began with the disclosure that the SEC was now pursuing a formal investigation, prompted by questions related to Enron's dealings with ""related parties"". Enron's board also announced that it would commission a special committee to investigate the transactions, directed by William C. Powers, the dean of the University of Texas law school.[68] The next day, an editorial in The New York Times demanded an ""aggressive"" investigation into the matter.[69] Enron was able to secure an additional $1 billion in financing from cross-town rival Dynegy on November 2, but the news was not universally admired in that the debt was secured by assets from the company's valuable Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline.[70]

Proposed buyout by Dynegy[edit]
Sources claimed that Enron was planning to explain its business practices more fully within the coming days, as a confidence-building gesture.[71] Enron's stock was now trading at around $7, and by this time it was obvious that Enron could not stay independent. However, investors worried that the company would not be able to find a buyer.[citation needed]
After Enron had received a wide spectrum of rejections, Enron management apparently found a buyer when the board of Dynegy, another energy trader based in Houston, voted late at night on November 7 to acquire Enron at a very low price of about $8 billion in stock.[72] Chevron Texaco, which at the time owned about a quarter of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion in cash, specifically $1 billion at first and the rest when the deal was completed. Dynegy would also be required to assume nearly $13 billion of debt, plus any other debt hitherto occluded by the Enron management's secretive business practices,[72] possibly as much as $10 billion in ""hidden"" debt.[73] Dynegy and Enron confirmed their deal on November 8, 2001.[citation needed]
With Enron in a state of near collapse, the deal was largely on Dynegy's terms. Dynegy would be the surviving company, and Dynegy CEO Charles Watson and his management team would head the merged company. Enron shareholders would get a 40 percent stake in the enlarged Dynegy, and Enron would get three seats on the merged company's board. Lay would not have any management role, though it was presumed he would get one of Enron's seats on the board. Of Enron's senior executives, only Whalley would join the merged company's C-suite, as an executive vice president. Dynegy agreed to invest $1.5 billion into Enron to keep it alive until the deal closed.[43][11]: 395 
As a measure of how dire Enron's financial picture had become, the company initially balked at paying its bills for November until the credit agencies gave the merger their blessing and allowed Enron to keep its credit at investment grade. By this time, the Dynegy deal was virtually the only thing keeping the company alive, and Enron officials wanted to keep as much cash in the company's coffers in the event of bankruptcy.[43] Had the credit agencies balked at the deal and reduced Enron to junk status, its ability to trade would be severely limited if there was a reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors.[74][43] Ultimately, after Enron and Dynegy retooled the deal to make it harder for Dynegy to trigger the ""material adverse change"" clause and pull out, Moody's and S&P agreed to drop Enron to one notch above junk status, allowing Enron to pay its bills one day late with interest.[43]
Commentators remarked on the different corporate cultures between Dynegy and Enron, and on Watson's ""straight-talking"" personality.[8] Some wondered if Enron's troubles had not simply been the result of innocent accounting errors.[75] By November, Enron was asserting that the billion-plus ""one-time charges"" disclosed in October should in reality have been $200 million, with the rest of the amount simply corrections of dormant accounting mistakes.[76] Many feared other ""mistakes"" and restatements might yet be revealed.[74]
Another major correction of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with a reduction of $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron.[76] Both companies were said to be anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S&P presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.[73]
Both companies promoted the deal aggressively, and some observers were hopeful; Watson was praised for  attempting to create the largest company on the energy market.[74] At the time, Watson said: ""We feel [Enron] is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months.""[74] One analyst called the deal ""a whopper ... a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron.""[77]
Credit issues were becoming more critical, however. Around the time the buyout was made public, Moody's and S&P publicly announced that they had reduced Enron to just above junk status.[74] In a conference call, S&P affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S&P would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status.[78] Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was ""nothing wrong with Enron's business"".[77] He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis.[77] The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his ""reputation in tatters"",[79] stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year. An official at a company owned by Enron stated ""We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000. It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan.""[80]
Watson assured investors that the true nature of Enron's business had been made apparent to him: ""We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop. If there is no shoe, this is a phenomenally good transaction.""[78] Watson further asserted that Enron's energy trading part alone was worth the price Dynegy was paying for the whole company.[81]
By mid-November, Enron announced it was planning to sell about $8 billion worth of underperforming assets, along with a general plan to reduce its scale for the sake of financial stability.[82] On November 19 Enron disclosed to the public further evidence of its critical state of affairs, most pressingly that the company had debt repayment obligations in the range of $9 billion by the end of 2002. Such debts were ""vastly in excess"" of its available cash.[83] Also, the success of measures to preserve its solvency were not guaranteed, specifically as regarded asset sales and debt refinancing. In a statement, Enron revealed ""An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.""[83]
Two days later, on November 21, Wall Street expressed serious doubts that Dynegy would proceed with its deal at all, or would seek to radically renegotiate. Furthermore, Enron revealed in a 10-Q filing that almost all the money it had recently borrowed for purposes including buying its commercial paper, or about $5 billion, had been exhausted in just 50 days. Analysts were unnerved at the revelation, especially since Dynegy was reported to have also been unaware of Enron's rate of cash use.[84] In order to end the proposed buyout, Dynegy would need to legally demonstrate a ""material change"" in the circumstances of the transaction; as late as November 22, sources close to Dynegy were skeptical that the latest revelations constituted sufficient grounds.[85] Indeed, while Lay assumed that one of his underlings had shared the 10-Q with Dynegy officials, no one at Dynegy saw it until it was released to the public. It subsequently emerged that Enron's traders had grabbed much of the money from Dynegy's cash infusion and used it to guarantee payment to their trading partners when it came time to settle up.[43]
The SEC announced it had filed civil fraud complaints against Andersen.[86] A few days later, sources claimed Enron and Dynegy were renegotiating the terms of their arrangement.[87] Dynegy now demanded Enron agree to be bought for $4 billion rather than the previous $8 billion. Observers were reporting difficulties in ascertaining which of Enron's operations, if any, were profitable. Reports described an en masse shift of business to Enron's competitors for the sake of risk exposure reduction.[87]

Bankruptcy[edit]
Enron's stock price (former NYSE ticker symbol: ENE) from August 23, 2000 ($90) to January 11, 2002 ($0.12). As a result of the decrease of the stock price, shareholders incurred paper losses of nearly $11 billion.[3]
On November 28, 2001, Enron's two worst possible outcomes came true. Credit rating agencies all reduced Enron's credit rating to junk status, and Dynegy's board tore up the merger agreement on Watson's advice. Watson later said, ""At the end, you couldn't give it [Enron] to me.""[11]: 403  Although they had seemingly ironed out a number of outstanding issues at a meeting in New York over the previous weekend, ultimately Dynegy's concerns about Enron's liquidity and dwindling business proved insurmountable.[43] The company had very little cash with which to operate, let alone satisfy enormous debts. Its stock price fell to $0.61 at the end of the day's trading. One editorial observer wrote that ""Enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm.""[88]
Systemic consequences were felt, as Enron's creditors and other energy trading companies suffered the loss of several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure indicated the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could.[89] The question now became how to determine the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early calculations estimated $18.7 billion. One adviser stated, ""We don't really know who is out there exposed to Enron's credit. I'm telling my clients to prepare for the worst.""[90]
Within 24 hours, speculation abounded that Enron would have no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Enron was estimated to have about $23 billion in liabilities from both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans. Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase in particular appeared to have significant amounts to lose with Enron's bankruptcy. Additionally, many of Enron's major assets were pledged to lenders in order to secure loans, causing doubt about what, if anything, unsecured creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings.[91] As it turned out, new corporate treasurer Ray Bowen had known as early as the day Dynegy pulled out of the deal that Enron was headed for bankruptcy. He spent most of the next two days scrambling to find a bank who would take Enron's remaining cash after pulling all of its money out of Citibank. He was ultimately forced to make do with a small Houston bank.[43]
By the close of business on November 30, 2001, it was obvious Enron was at the end of its tether. That day, Enron Europe, the holding company for Enron's operations in continental Europe, filed for bankruptcy.[92] The rest of Enron followed suit the following night, December 1, when the board voted unanimously to file for Chapter 11 protection.[43] It became the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, surpassing the 1970 bankruptcy of the Penn Central (WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year surpassed Enron's bankruptcy so the title was short held), and resulted in 4,000 lost jobs.[3][93] The day that Enron filed for bankruptcy, thousands of employees were told to pack their belongings and given 30 minutes to vacate the building.[94] Nearly 62% of 15,000 employees' savings plans relied on Enron stock that was purchased at $83 in early 2001 and was now practically worthless.[95]



In its accounting work for Enron, Andersen had been sloppy and weak. But that's how Enron had always wanted it. In truth, even as they angrily pointed fingers, the two deserved each other.


—Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind in The Smartest Guys in the Room[11]: 393 

On January 17, 2002, Enron dismissed Arthur Andersen as its auditor, citing its accounting advice and the destruction of documents. Andersen countered that it had already ended its relationship with the company when Enron became bankrupt.[96]

Trials[edit]
Enron[edit]
Main article: Trial of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling
Fastow and his wife, Lea, both pleaded guilty to charges against them. Fastow was initially charged with 98 counts of fraud, money laundering, insider trading, and conspiracy, among other crimes.[97] Fastow pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy and was sentenced to ten years with no parole in a plea bargain to testify against Lay, Skilling, and Causey.[98] Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in favor of a single misdemeanor tax charge. Lea was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide income from the government.[99]
Lay and Skilling went on trial for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page indictment covered a broad range of financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison.[100] In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.[101]
Lay pleaded not guilty to the eleven criminal charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow.[102] Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison.[103] However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. Linda Lay sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001.[104] Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.[105]
Although Michael Kopper worked at Enron for more than seven years, Lay did not know of Kopper even after the company's bankruptcy. Kopper was able to keep his name anonymous in the entire affair.[11]: 153  Kopper was the first Enron executive to plead guilty.[106] Rick Causey was indicted with six felony charges for disguising Enron's financial condition during his tenure.[107] After pleading not guilty, he later switched to guilty and was sentenced to seven years in prison.[108]
All told, sixteen people pleaded guilty for crimes committed at the company,[109] and five others, including four former Merrill Lynch employees (three of whose convictions were subsequently overturned on appeal),[110][111][112] were found guilty. Eight former Enron executives testified—the main witness being Fastow—against Lay and Skilling, his former bosses.[93] Another was Kenneth Rice, the former chief of Enron Corp.'s high-speed Internet unit, who cooperated and whose testimony helped convict Skilling and Lay. In June 2007, he received a 27-month sentence.[113]
Michael W. Krautz, a former Enron accountant, was among the accused who was acquitted[114] of charges related to the scandal. Represented by Barry Pollack,[115] Krautz was acquitted of federal criminal fraud charges after a month-long jury trial.[116]

Arthur Andersen[edit]
Main article: Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States
Arthur Andersen was found guilty of obstruction of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting emails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron.[117] Although only a small number of Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs.[118][119] The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen.[120] The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.

NatWest Three[edit]
Main article: NatWest Three
Giles Darby, David Bermingham, and Gary Mulgrew worked for Greenwich NatWest. The three British men had worked with Fastow on a special purpose entity he had started called Swap Sub. When Fastow was being investigated by the SEC, the three men met with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) in November 2001 to discuss their interactions with Fastow.[121] In June 2002, the U.S. issued warrants for their arrest on seven counts of wire fraud, and they were then extradited. On July 12, a potential Enron witness scheduled to be extradited to the U.S., Neil Coulbeck, was found dead in a park in north-east London.[122] Coulbeck's death was eventually ruled to have been a suicide.[123]  In a plea bargain in November 2007, the trio pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud while the other six counts were dismissed.[124] Darby, Bermingham, and Mulgrew were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.[125] In August 2010, Bermingham and Mulgrew retracted their confessions.[126]

Aftermath[edit]
Employees and shareholders[edit]
Enron's headquarters in Downtown Houston was leased from a consortium of banks who had bought the property for $285 million in the 1990s. It was sold for $55.5 million, just before Enron moved out in 2004.[127]
While some employees, like John D. Arnold, received large bonuses in the final days of the company,[128] Enron's shareholders lost $74 billion in the four years before the company's bankruptcy ($40 to $45 billion was attributed to fraud).[129] As Enron had nearly $67 billion that it owed creditors and shareholders received limited, if any, assistance aside from severance from Enron.[130] To pay its creditors, Enron was legally ordered to sell assets including art, photographs, logo signs, and its pipelines.[131][132][133]
A class action lawsuit on behalf of about 20,000 Enron employees who alleged mismanagement of their 401(k) plans resulted in a July 2005 settlement of $356 million against Enron and 401(k) manager Northern Trust.[134] A year later the settlement was reduced to $37.5 million in an agreement by Federal judge Melinda Harmon, with Northern Trust neither admitting or denying wrongdoing.[135]
In May 2004, more than 20,000 of Enron's former employees won a suit of $85 million for compensation of $2 billion that was lost from their pensions. From the settlement, the employees each received about $3,100.[136] The next year, investors received another settlement from several banks of $4.2 billion.[129] In September 2008, a $7.2-billion settlement from a $40-billion lawsuit, was reached on behalf of the shareholders. The settlement was distributed among the main plaintiff, University of California (UC), and 1.5 million individuals and groups. UC's law firm Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman and Robbins, received $688 million in fees, the highest in a U.S. securities fraud case.[137] At the distribution, UC announced in a press release ""We are extremely pleased to be returning these funds to the members of the class. Getting here has required a long, challenging effort, but the results for Enron investors are unprecedented.""[138]

Sarbanes–Oxley Act[edit]


In the Titanic, the captain went down with the ship. And Enron looks to me like the captain first gave himself and his friends a bonus, then lowered himself and the top folks down the lifeboat and then hollered up and said, ""By the way, everything is going to be just fine.""


—U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan[139]

Main article: Sarbanes–Oxley Act
Between December 2001 and April 2002, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services held multiple hearings about the Enron scandal and related accounting and investor protection issues. These hearings and the corporate scandals that followed Enron led to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on July 30, 2002.[140] The Act is nearly ""a mirror image of Enron: the company's perceived corporate governance failings are matched virtually point for point in the principal provisions of the Act.""[141]
The main provisions of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act included the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to develop standards for the preparation of audit reports; the restriction of public accounting companies from providing any non-auditing services when auditing; provisions for the independence of audit committee members, executives being required to sign off on financial reports, and relinquishment of certain executives' bonuses in case of financial restatements; and expanded financial disclosure of companies' relationships with unconsolidated entities.[140]
On February 13, 2002, due to the instances of corporate malfeasances and accounting violations, the SEC recommended changes of the stock exchanges' regulations. In June 2002, the New York Stock Exchange announced a new governance proposal, which was approved by the SEC in November 2003. The main provisions of the final NYSE proposal include:[140]

All companies must have a majority of independent directors.
Independent directors must comply with an elaborate definition of independent directors.
The compensation committee, nominating committee, and audit committee shall consist of independent directors.
All audit committee members should be financially literate. In addition, at least one member of the audit committee is required to have accounting or related financial management expertise.
In addition to its regular sessions, the board should hold additional sessions without management.
Criticism of the Bush administration[edit]
Kenneth Lay was a longtime supporter of U.S. president George W. Bush and a donor to his various political campaigns, including his successful bid for the presidency in 2000.[142][143]  As such, critics of Bush and his administration attempted to link them to the scandal.  A January 2002 article in The Economist claimed that Lay had been a close personal friend of Bush's family and had backed him financially since his unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1978.  Allegedly, Lay was even rumored at one point to be in the running to serve as Secretary of Energy for Bush.[144]
In an article that same month, Time magazine accused the Bush administration of making desperate attempts to distance themselves from the scandal.  According to author Frank Pellegrini, various Bush appointments held connections to Enron, including deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove as a stockholder, Secretary of the Army Thomas E. White Jr. as a former executive, and SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, a former employee of Arthur Andersen.  Former Montana governor Marc Racicot, whom Bush considered for appointment for Secretary of the Interior, briefly served as a lobbyist for the company after leaving office.  After opening a criminal investigation into the scandal, Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself and his chief of staff from the case when Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman accused Ashcroft of receiving $25,000 from Enron for his failed reelection campaign to the Senate in 2000.  As Pellegrini wrote, ""The Democrats will have the company-he-keeps, guilt-by-association thing on their side, and with all the ... general whiff of rich man's cover-up about the whole affair, they'll have a class warfare card to play this spring.""[145]
Ken Lay had made phone calls to then-Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill.[146][147][148]

At one stage, Mr Lay was mooted as a possible energy secretary under Mr Bush.

"What is the story behind ""The Room""?","""The Room"" is a 2003 mockumentary film directed by and starring Tommy Wiseau. The film follows the life of Johnny, a young man who moves to San Francisco in search of his future. During his journey, he meets a group of friends and a woman named Lisa, who becomes his love interest.

The film was shot over a period of 120 days in San Francisco, and was mainly shot in one location, a house that Wiseau had purchased for the purpose of filming. The house was located in the Richmond district of San Francisco, and Wiseau spent a significant amount of time renovating it to make it suitable for filming.

The film features a non-linear narrative structure, with flashbacks and flash-forwards used to depict different points in Johnny's life. The film also features a number of creative visual effects, such as split screens and rapid cutting, which were used to create a sense of energy and excitement on screen.

The film was released to a mixed reception, with some critics praising the film's unique style and tone, while others criticized the film's lack of coherence and the performances of the actors. However, the film has gained a cult following over the years, and is often cited as one of the most unique and memorable films of the 21st century.",False,https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/2/16720012/the-room-tommy-wiseau-backstory-explained,"The Room: How the worst movie ever became a Hollywood legend | VoxSkip to main contentThe homepageVoxVox logoExplainersPoliticsCultureAdviceListenAudioWatchVideoMenuThe homepageVoxVox logoNavigation DrawerLogin / Sign UpcloseCloseSearchVideoWatchAudioListenCrosswordPlayExplainersPoliticsCultureAdviceScienceTechnologyClimateHealthMoneyLifeFuture PerfectNewslettersBecome a MemberFacebookInstagramYoutubeRSSTikTokVoxVox logoThe Room: how the worst movie ever became a Hollywood legend as bizarre as its creatorClarity in this chaotic news cycleThere’s an overwhelming amount of news, but not enough context.

It’s also an incredible study in mythmaking.by  Aja RomanoUpdated Dec 19, 2017, 5:35 PM UTCFacebookLinkTommy Wiseau poses next to a poster for The Room. Josh Brasted/Getty ImagesAja Romano writes about pop culture, media, and ethics. Before joining Vox in 2016, they were a staff reporter at the Daily Dot. A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they’re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.The Room may not actually be the worst movie ever made, but it almost certainly holds the distinction for weirdest film trajectory: nearly 15 years from premiere to national release. That’s right, The Room is finally about to open, for one day only, in 600 theaters nationwide. The January 10 showing is the latest ironic twist in the journey of a cult film like none other, and the culmination of its creator’s long quest for fame and Hollywood’s respect.For more than five years during the mid-2000s, an incongruous billboard loomed over Highland Avenue in West Hollywood. It was a mostly black-and-white movie ad, and its only prominent features were the name of its subject, a website, and a phone number to “RSVP” for a showing at one of the film’s only two release locations. Most striking of all was the billboard’s sole photo, a mug-shot-like headshot of a man with a morose scowl and a widow’s peak.The lack of context surrounding the ominous photo made the ad difficult to parse. Was The Room a noir crime thriller? A gothic horror? A scam ad for a bail bondsman or perhaps a vampire cult LARP?The Room was, in a way, all of this and much more. The man in the now-infamous billboard headshot is Tommy Wiseau, The Room’s writer, producer, director, star, and savant. Although The Room played for only two weeks in the summer of 2003, reportedly grossing a mere $1,900 in just two theaters, Wiseau continued to spend a reported $5,000 a week to bankroll the Highland billboard. This odd and exorbitant expense was one of many examples of apparent wastefulness that would come to fascinate fans of The Room, and help earn Wiseau a reputation as “the Orson Welles of crap.”But amid all the nonsense associated with The Room — its inexplicable $6 million production budget; its awkward, endless sex scenes and vanishing subplots and characters; its incoherent dialogue slurred by Wiseau’s thick, nebulously European accent — the everlasting billboard may have in fact evinced stealth marketing savvy. For by the time the billboard finally came down in 2008, a true Hollywood miracle had occurred: The Room had become a major cult hit.After failing to secure a wide release after its premiere, The Room became a word-of-mouth fascination around Hollywood, as celebrities like Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd, and Kristen Bell came to its lone monthly midnight showing, organized private viewings, and passed around stories of its mythical filming conditions. The secret of The Room spread until it was a cult phenomenon. Today it has spawned seemingly endless viewings at midnight showings around the world, where fans quote the film’s garbled script by heart, hurl spoons at the screen, and treat Wiseau and the film’s other cast members like celebrities. From its early days, The Room has hypnotized viewers. Now, with the release of The Disaster Artist, James Franco’s new film about the making of The Room, Wiseau’s creation has finally crossed dimensions and garnered legitimate Hollywood success.Franco’s The Disaster Artist is an adaptation of the 2013 book of the same name, which Wiseau’s best friend and co-star Greg Sestero co-wrote with journalist Tom Bissell about his relationship with Wiseau and the filming of The Room. The book is a hilarious recounting of a true cult success, as well as a poignant examination of the myth of Hollywood fame and its impact on the lost souls who seek it. It’s not exactly what you’d expect as the outcome of The Room — a film that never actually explains what “the room” is.If all this leaves you wondering why? how? and what’s that about spoons? you’re not alone. And that confusion is the very heart of the matter: Had The Room not come packaged with so much internal befuddlement, a legendarily strange production experience, and a mysterious man at its center, it would have been destined for obscurity. Here’s how it avoided that fate and turned “Oh, hi, Mark” into a catchphrase for the ages.What is The Room?The Room is a 2003 movie written, produced, and directed by Wiseau, who also stars as its main character, Johnny. It was originally envisioned as a stage play, then turned into a 500-page novel, and ultimately finalized as a movie script. Since its cult success, Wiseau has tried to pass his film off as a “black comedy” rather than an inept melodrama that’s unintentionally funny, but he’s not fooling anyone.The Room is ostensibly a tale of betrayal. Johnny, a stand-in for Wiseau himself, is living the American dream: He owns a nice apartment in San Francisco, he works a cushy, if vague, job at “the bank,” and he’s beloved by his friends. But Johnny’s “future wife,” Lisa (Juliette Daniels), is cheating on him with his best friend, Mark, played by Sestero. Mark is a cherubic but easily confused jock who’s helpless to resist Lisa’s wiles, even as their affair takes a toll on their entire social circle.The Room plays out like a Jacobean tragedy set to a sleazy slow jams soundtrack, ultimately resolving in what it tries very hard to present as a sad ending. But The Room utterly fails in its attempts to make us take seriously these characters and plot points, because we’re too busy marveling at the weirdness of every single thing happening onscreen.Lots of movies are weird. Why is this one the weirdest?The plot description above does nothing to prepare you for The Room’s strangeness. Wiseau’s script and directorial style seem to be channeling a mix of Mulholland Drive and Jingle All the Way. Actors cringe their way through terrible line reads, awkward staging, blurry green-screening, and especially creepy sex scenes. Johnny’s apartment is full of framed photos of spoons.The characters in The Room seem to be caught in a surreal alternate universe where human behavior has none of its traditionally understood signifiers and human speech is Dadaist nonsense. Characters respond with, “Don’t worry about it,” to everything from impending breakups to terminal illness. “I’m very busy,” Mark insists while doing absolutely nothing. Grown men taunt each other by making chicken noises. Characters perpetually greet each other, until the word “hi” loses all meaning — as in the famous scene (adeptly showcased in the first trailer for The Disaster Artist) in which Johnny seems to switch moods on a dime in order to declare what is now The Room’s most famous line:Plot points appear and disappear at random. One character completely vanishes without explanation at the end of the film and an entirely new character replaces him, deadpanning, “I feel like I’m sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off.” One character announces she “definitely has breast cancer” — only to never mention it again.The inexperienced ensemble struggles to make sense of their parts. Lisa, the femme fatale played by an awkward 20-year-old Daniels (who had no idea what she was getting into), is presented like a sultry Victoria’s Secret model, even though her lines are more appropriate for a scheming daytime television matriarch. Daniels, who was obviously neither of these extremes, winds up looking perpetually uncomfortable, which makes the film’s constant descriptions of Lisa as a conniving sex goddess seem strange and discordant.Even odder is Denny (Philip Haldiman), a young boy whom Johnny is mentoring: He talks like a high school freshman but appears to be in his mid-20s. He wanders in and out of Johnny’s apparently unlocked apartment with abandon, gets into pillow fights with Johnny and Lisa, and tries to watch them having sex. He might actually be a cat. In one of the film’s most famous scenes, Denny has a brush with a drug dealer known only as “Chris R” (Dan Janjigian), who appears once, brandishing a gun and demanding money, and then is never seen again. As Denny sobs that he’s sorry for all the drama, Lisa screams, “What kind of money?” Johnny continually grabs Denny’s hair, and Mark inexplicably announces, “It’s clear.” Above all, there’s Johnny, who can’t really be separated from Wiseau’s own baffling, stilted mannerisms and appearance. His stringy hair, his over-the-top acting, and his unfathomable creative choices truly have to be seen rather than described, as in the infamous scene in which he confronts Lisa by imitating James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause: The film’s absurdism is especially prominent when it comes to women. When Mark tells Johnny a disturbing story about a woman enduring a brutal domestic assault, Johnny responds by laughing. “Men and women use and abuse each other all the time — there’s nothing wrong with it,” Lisa’s mother Claudette declares. The plot line’s overtly misogynistic and homoerotic overtones would be cringe-worthy in another movie, but The Room’s many other abundant oddities make elements that would be controversial in a normal movie seem quaint in this one. The Room is the quintessential cult film, one whose excess and eccentricities become the cinematic equivalent of an alien trying and failing to assimilate among humans. It’s a film that’s tremendously easy to love ironically — and we all know millennials are good at that. But it’s also a film that’s genuinely mesmerizing, that earns each of its repeat viewings.And if anything, the story behind the story is even more fascinating than what’s onscreen.How did this get made?The story behind The Room’s creation is a surprisingly layered one, as Franco’s film hilariously and poignantly details. The Room is the result of Wiseau’s own exorbitance and desperation to achieve lasting success, fueled by his apparently bottomless wealth. But The Room is also the work of a first-time director who’d never been on a film set before. This combination of excess and cluelessness led to a bloated production that cost $6 million yet still wound up looking as though it were filmed on a shoestring budget.The production also included nigh-incomprehensible footnotes, like Wiseau’s decision to build a fully functional private bathroom for himself on set while refusing to pay for air conditioning or allow cast members to have water bottles during filming — which resulted in one cast member collapsing on a hot day. Then there was his bonkers decision to shoot the film on two cameras at the same time, using both 35mm format film and digital HD footage, the latter of which he ultimately discarded. In a 2009 interview, he stated that he filmed the movie twice because “entire Hollywood was confused.”In his Disaster Artist book, Sestero claims that The Room owes what coherence it does have to uncredited script supervisor Sandy Schklair, a Hollywood veteran portrayed by Seth Rogen in Franco’s film. “The only reason we’d gotten anything even remotely watchable on film was due to his ability to turn Tommy’s vision into something slightly less extraterrestrial,” Sestero states. Wiseau’s controlling nature, tendency to berate and publicly humiliate actors and crew members, and habit of arriving hours late to the set made him the greatest obstacle to The Room’s completion.On its surface, The Room isn’t much different from other great “bad” cult films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Troll 2, or the long litany of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 offerings. It features many of the same classic bad-film hallmarks, like a would-be auteur writer-director whose primary creative stamp is his bad judgment.But other terrible movies that have become cult hits have typically been the result of low budgets, bad actors and effects, and creators clashing with studios. The Room, on the other hand, had a seemingly endless production budget, a large film crew of about 30 experienced professionals (nearly all of whom walked off and had to be replaced), and zero studio interference. The Room was uniquely free to be what its creator wanted it to be.In other words, The Room is exactly as bizarre as its creator itself.So who is Tommy Wiseau?Left, Wiseau as a young man, around the time he came to America; right, Wiseau in 2017. Simon and Schuster; IB Times UKTommy Wiseau was born nobody knows when, with an unconfirmed last name, in an unconfirmed location in Eastern Europe.According to Rick Harper, creator of the 2016 documentary Room Full of Spoons, which Wiseau attempted to block from circulation, Wiseau hails from Poznan, Poland. This is an origin allegedly revealed unwittingly in The Room’s recurring “cheep cheep!” motif, in which members of the cast borrow a common Polish practice and stand around chirping at one another as a taunt of cowardice.The speculation that Wiseau hails from a part of the former communist bloc is echoed in a climactic chapter of The Disaster Artist. In it, Sestero relates a narrative that he gleaned in bits and pieces from Wiseau over the years, of Wiseau growing up in a repressive Central European society “sometime after the death of Stalin,” dreaming of America and drinking in imported American culture via Disney movies and rock ’n’ roll. Eventually Wiseau bribed his way to France, where he began calling himself Pierre.According to Sestero’s account, “Pierre” may have endured brutal working conditions, police brutality, anti-communist prejudice, homelessness, and a stint as a prostitute before finally securing a passport and a trip to America to begin a new life. Though Wiseau claimed for a long time that New Orleans was his place of origin, he apparently moved to Louisiana from France to live with his uncle and aunt. From there, all research seems to point to Pierre moving to San Francisco, legally changing his name to Tommy Wiseau and amassing a fortune selling cheap imported goods at a markup along Fisherman’s Wharf.For his part, Wiseau has deliberately kept the details of his past and his financial history shady, and The Disaster Artist makes clear that all of his narratives — even the ones that Sestero pieces together as likely legitimate facts amid all of the fiction — are unreliable and unverifiable.But of course all this mystery is part of The Room’s mythos. “I kind of don’t want to know more,” Bissell said about the mystique of Wiseau in a 2013 interview. “The guy is basically Jay Gatsby, and Jay Gatsby is such a more interesting character than James Gatz.”What does seem clear from Sestero’s account of his friendship with Wiseau is that Wiseau was largely alone and friendless before he met Sestero, which might have to do with his temperamental personality and controlling nature. What’s also abundantly clear is that Wiseau, sans talent or encouragement, still yearned so desperately to be an actor that when Hollywood wouldn’t take his calls, he spent a fortune to make his own movie.How did all of this lead to The Disaster Artist?The story of The Disaster Artist is largely a story of The Room’s baffled fans coming to a greater understanding of it, and then wanting to be a part of it. There seems to be something about Wiseau’s struggle for legitimate Hollywood success, the sheer determination he showed in making The Room happen, and the desperate alienation that drove him to it that makes fans of The Room want to insert themselves into the story, to be a part of the film’s legacy in some tangible way.You can see that impulse coalescing around The Disaster Artist. After seeing The Room for the first time, Bissell wrote a long piece about the film’s popularity in 2010 for Harper’s Magazine. Sestero liked it so much he agreed to meet with Bissell, and then went on to co-write his memoir with him. Franco, as a longtime fan of The Room, then reviewed said memoir, The Disaster Artist, for Vice. “The book turns Tommy’s sometimes ridiculous struggle into a paradigm for those wishing to be creative in a world where it is usually too hard to be,” Franco wrote in his review. “In so many ways, Tommy c’est moi.”Franco went on to channel Wiseau by co-writing, producing, directing, and starring in the subsequent film adaptation of the memoir. Plenty of Hollywood A-listers were eager to help. “A lot of comedians and great dramatic actors are fans of The Room, so we ended up getting this incredible cast,” Franco told Vox’s Alissa Wilkinson in a recent interview about filming The Disaster Artist. “We had a lot of elements going for us.”Should I watch The Room or read The Disaster Artist before the new movie?It’s not necessary to watch The Room or read The Disaster Artist before you see Franco’s adaptation of the latter. But you should definitely check out both when you get a chance.If you want to watch The Room — and you should; the various YouTube clips included here in no way do it justice — it’s best to watch it in a quiet place before you venture out to one of the many midnight showings in cities around the country. Like other cult films such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, screenings of The Room have evolved their own performative audience interactivity. If you try to simultaneously parse The Room for the first time and participate in it, you’ll likely end up hopelessly confused.Once you have watched The Room in a safe environment, however, you are free to bring a packet of plastic spoons to the nearest cinema and toss them to your heart’s content. The art of throwing spoons whenever the framed spoon photos show up onscreen is the midnight showing’s most famed ritual, but there are many others as well, like shouting, “Go! Go!” or, “Water!” whenever any of the film’s numerous establishing shots roll by, and inserting, “Because you’re a woman!” in reaction to the film’s plentiful sexism.The next stop along your Room journey should be the audiobook of The Disaster Artist, which is narrated by Sestero himself. Not only is Sestero’s Wiseau impression spot-on, but hearing him deliver it so effortlessly is an ever-present reminder of just how well he knows Wiseau, which really enriches the story and is best heard for yourself.Sestero’s The Disaster Artist serves as a deep dive into Wiseau’s psychology as well as the author’s own Hollywood career struggles. It draws prominent parallels between Wiseau and Sestero’s relationship and two distinct but telling narratives: Sunset Boulevard and The Talented Mr. Ripley. In each parallel, Wiseau figures as the predatory, isolated, and desolate figure whose desperation for companionship and deep ambition draws Sestero helplessly into a codependent relationship. Franco’s film version of The Disaster Artist is lighter on these psychological details, though they’re still there.The Disaster Artist book stops short of describing what the opening night of The Room was like in 2003. Franco’s version of it, however, inserts a grand staging of the event that ultimately becomes a traditional Hollywood happy ending.All in all, that seems a fitting conclusion for a saga that is ultimately less a story about bad movies than it is a story of extravagant mythmaking — and one man’s improbable dream come true.See More: BooksCultureExplainersMoviesMost PopularAn eerie prophecy of Trump’s second term — from 1998The kid-friendly policy that’s quietly sweeping the countryHow to stop Trump’s power grabWhy are young men so hopeless at dating?Take a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordToday, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

What is the Dengue virus?,"The dengue virus is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a member of the Flavivirus genus, which is also responsible for causing diseases such as yellow fever and West Nile virus.

The dengue virus has four distinct serotypes, each of which is associated with a different clinical presentation. These serotypes include DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. The most common serotype is DENV-2, which is responsible for most dengue outbreaks worldwide.

Dengue virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which is found in many tropical and subtropical regions. The virus can also be transmitted from person to person through close contact, such as in a healthcare setting.

Symptoms of dengue virus infection can vary depending on the severity of the infection, but typically include a sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and a skin rash. Severe dengue infection can lead to more serious complications, such as hemorrhage, shock, and dengue shock syndrome.

Dengue virus outbreaks can occur in any region where the mosquito vector is present, and the disease is endemic in many parts of the world. The number of dengue cases has increased significantly in recent years, particularly in urban areas, due to factors such as urbanization, changes in land use, and the introduction of new mosquito populations.

In recent years, dengue virus has also been associated with more severe and deadly outcomes, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. These complications can occur in both children and adults and can lead to death if left untreated.

In conclusion, the dengue virus is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can cause a range of symptoms and complications, depending on the severity of the infection. The disease is endemic in many parts of the world and can be transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is important to take steps to prevent mosquito bites and to seek medical attention if symptoms of dengue virus infection are present.",True,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue,"

Dengue and severe dengue

23 April 2024

















 Key factsDengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes.About half of the world's population is now at risk of dengue with an estimated 100–400 million infections occurring each year.Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.While many dengue infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild illness, the virus can occasionally cause more severe cases, and even death.Prevention and control of dengue depend on vector control. There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue. Overview Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates.Most people who get dengue will not have symptoms. But for those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and rash. Most will get better in 1–2 weeks. Some people develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital. In severe cases, dengue can be fatal.  You can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites especially during the day.Dengue is treated with pain medicine as there is no specific treatment currently.SymptomsMost people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.  If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include:high fever (40°C/104°F)severe headachepain behind the eyesmuscle and joint painsnauseavomitingswollen glandsrash. Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue.Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has gone away:severe abdominal painpersistent vomitingrapid breathingbleeding gums or nose fatiguerestlessnessblood in vomit or stoolbeing very thirstypale and cold skinfeeling weak.People with these severe symptoms should get care right away. After recovery, people who have had dengue may feel tired for several weeks.Diagnostics and treatmentThere is no specific treatment for dengue. The focus is on treating pain symptoms. Most cases of dengue fever can be treated at home with pain medicine.Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is often used to control pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding.For people with severe dengue, hospitalization is often needed.Global burdenThe incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades, with cases reported to WHO increasing from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 5.2 million in 2019. A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. Many cases are also misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses (1).  The highest number of dengue cases was recorded in 2023, affecting over 80 countries in all regions of WHO. Since the beginning of 2023 ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases, resulted in a historic high of over 6.5 million cases and more than 7300 dengue-related deaths reported. Several factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic: the changing distribution of the vectors (chiefly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes), especially in previously dengue naïve countries; the consequences of El Niño phenomena in 2023 and climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall and humidity; fragile health systems in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; and political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements. One modelling estimate indicates 390 million dengue virus infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically (2). Another study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 3.9 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue viruses (3).The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO Regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing around 70% of the global disease burden.Dengue is spreading to new areas in Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean and South America. The largest number of dengue cases reported was in 2023. The WHO Region of the Americas reported 4.5 million cases, with 2300 deaths. A high number of cases were reported in Asia: Bangladesh (321 000), Malaysia (111 400), Thailand (150 000), and Viet Nam (369 000).TransmissionTransmission through the mosquito biteThe dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Other species within the Aedes genus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is normally secondary to Aedes aegypti. However, in 2023, a surge in local transmission of dengue by Aedes albopictus (tiger mosquito) has been seen in Europe. After feeding on a infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8–12 days when the ambient temperature is between 25–28°C. Variations in the extrinsic incubation period are not only influenced by ambient temperature; several factors such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, virus genotype, and initial viral concentration can also alter the time it takes for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infectious, the mosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of its life.Human-to-mosquito transmissionMosquitoes can become infected by people who are viremic with the dengue virus. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (they are pre-symptomatic), and also someone who shows no signs of illness (they are asymptomatic).Human-to-mosquito transmission can occur up to 2 days before someone shows symptoms of the illness, and up to 2 days after the fever has resolved.The risk of mosquito infection is positively associated with high viremia and high fever in the patient; conversely, high levels of DENV-specific antibodies are associated with a decreased risk of mosquito infection. Most people are viremic for about 4–5 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days.Maternal transmissionThe primary mode of transmission of the dengue virus between humans involves mosquito vectors. There is evidence however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (from a pregnant mother to her baby). At the same time, vertical transmission rates appear low, with the risk of vertical transmission seemingly linked to the timing of the dengue infection during the pregnancy. When a mother does have a dengue infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birthweight, and fetal distress.Other transmission modesRare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded. Similarly, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes have also been recorded. Risk factorsPrevious infection with DENV increases the risk of the individual developing severe dengue.Urbanization (especially unplanned), is associated with dengue transmission through multiple social and environmental factors: population density, human mobility, access to reliable water source, water storage practice etc.Community risks to dengue also depend on a population’s knowledge, attitude and practice towards dengue, as the exposure is closely related to behaviours such as water storage, plant keeping, and self-protection against mosquito bites.  Routine vector surveillance and control activities engaging community greatly enhances a community’s resilience. Vectors might adapt to new environments and climate. The interaction between dengue virus, the host and the environment is dynamic. Consequently, disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, in combination with increased urbanization and movement of populations.Prevention and controlThe mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the day. Lower the risk of getting dengue by protecting yourself from mosquito bites by using: clothes that cover as much of your body as possible;mosquito nets if sleeping during the day, ideally nets sprayed with insect repellent;window screens;mosquito repellents (containing DEET, Picaridin or IR3535); andcoils and vaporizers.Mosquito breeding can be prevented by:preventing mosquitoes from accessing egg-laying habitats by environmental management and modification;disposing of solid waste properly and removing artificial man-made habitats that can hold water;covering, emptying and cleaning domestic water storage containers on a weekly basis;applying appropriate insecticides to outdoor water storage containers.If you get dengue, it’s important to:rest;drink plenty of liquids;use acetaminophen (paracetamol) for pain;avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen and aspirin; andwatch for severe symptoms and contact your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any.So far one vaccine (QDenga) has been approved and licensed in some countries. However, it is recommended only for the age group of 6 to 16 years in high transmission settings. Several additional vaccines are under evaluation.WHO responseWHO responds to dengue in the following ways:supports countries in the confirmation of outbreaks through its collaborating network of laboratories;provides technical support and guidance to countries for the effective management of dengue outbreaks;supports countries in improving their reporting systems and capture the true burden of the disease;provides training on clinical management, diagnosis and vector control at the country and regional level with some of its collaborating centres;formulates evidence-based strategies and policies;support countries in the development of dengue prevention and control strategies and adopting the Global Vector Control Response (2017–2030) and the Global Arbovirus Initiative (2022–2025).reviews and recommends the development of new tools, including insecticide products and application technologies;gathers official records of dengue and severe dengue from over 100 Member States; andpublishes guidelines and handbooks for surveillance, case management, diagnosis, dengue prevention and control for Member States.ReferencesWaggoner, J.J., et al., Viremia and Clinical Presentation in Nicaraguan Patients Infected Wi1.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


American composer (1901–1974)
Not to be confused with Harry Patch.


Harry Partchc. 1952Born(1901-06-24)June 24, 1901Oakland, California, U.S.DiedSeptember 3, 1974(1974-09-03) (aged 73)Encinitas, California, U.S.OccupationsComposerwriterpianistpublisherteacherRelativesVirgil Partch (cousin)
Harry Partch (June 24, 1901 – September 3, 1974) was an American composer, music theorist, and creator of unique musical instruments.  He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales, alongside Lou Harrison.  He built his own instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described the method behind his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947).
Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones  derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave.  To play his music, Partch built many unique instruments, with such names as the Chromelodeon, the Quadrangularis Reversum, and the Zymo-Xyl.  Partch described his music as ""corporeal"" (emphasizing its physical/visceral elements), and distinguished it from abstract music, which he perceived as the dominant trend in Western music since the time of J.S. Bach, whose seminal book of preludes and fugues called The Well-tempered Clavier (in German, Das wohltemperierte Klavier) is often cited as the pivot point beyond which older mean-tone and ancient just intonation tunings were abandoned (in the late-18th century) and the then-future of Western Classical (and popular) instruments were (and most are still) based, for exploitation of all 24 theoretical key signatures.  Partch's earliest compositions were small-scale pieces to be intoned with simple folkloric-like string instrumental backing; his later works were large-scale (like a fusion of theater and music decidedly related to but quite apart from Wagnerian opera), they were integrated theater productions in which he expected each of the performers to sing, dance, speak, and play instruments in a ""corporeal apotheosis""[clarification needed]. Ancient Greek theatre and Japanese Noh and kabuki heavily influenced Harry Partch's music theatre.
Encouraged by his mother, Partch learned several instruments at a young age.  By fourteen, he was composing, and in particular took to setting dramatic situations.[clarification needed]  He dropped out of the University of Southern California's School of Music in 1922, dissatisfied with the quality of his teachers.  He took to self-study in San Francisco's libraries, where he discovered Hermann von Helmholtz's Sensations of Tone, which convinced him to devote himself to music based on scales tuned in just intonation.  In 1930, he burned all his previous compositions in a rejection of the European concert tradition.  Partch frequently moved around the US. Early in his career, he was a transient worker, and sometimes a hobo; later he depended on grants, university appointments, and record sales to support himself.  In 1970, supporters created the Harry Partch Foundation to administer Partch's music and instruments.


Personal history[edit]
Early life (1901–1919)[edit]
Partch's parents, Virgil and Jennie (1888).
On June 24, 1901, Partch was born in Oakland, California. His parents were Virgil Franklin Partch (1860–1919) and Jennie (née Childers, 1863–1920). The Presbyterian couple were missionaries, serving in China from 1888 to 1893, and again from 1895 to 1900, when they fled the Boxer Rebellion.[1]
Partch moved[when?] with his family to Arizona for his mother's health. His father worked for the Immigration Service there, and they settled in the small town of Benson. It was still the Wild West there in the early twentieth century, and Partch recalled seeing outlaws in town. Nearby, there were native Yaqui people, whose music he would hear.[2] His mother sang to him in Mandarin Chinese, and he heard and sang songs in Spanish. His mother encouraged her children to learn music, and he learned the mandolin, violin, piano,[1] reed organ, and cornet. His mother taught him to read music.[3]
In 1913, the family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Partch began to study the piano seriously. He obtained work playing keyboards for silent films while he was in high school. By 14, he was composing for the piano. He developed an early interest in writing music for dramatic situations,[clarification needed] and cited his lost composition Death and the Desert (1916) as an early example.[1]
In 1919, Partch graduated from high school[which?].[3]

Early experiments (1919–1947)[edit]
Partch in 1919
The family moved to Los Angeles in 1919 following the death of Partch's father.  There, his mother was killed in a trolley accident in 1920.  He enrolled in the University of Southern California's School of Music in 1920, but was dissatisfied with his teachers and left after the summer of 1922.[1]  He moved to San Francisco and studied books on music in the libraries there and continued to compose.[4]  In 1923 he came to reject the standard twelve-tone equal temperament of Western concert music when he discovered a translation of Hermann von Helmholtz's Sensations of Tone.  The book pointed Partch towards just intonation as an acoustic basis for his music.[5]  Around this time, while working as an usher for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he had a romantic relationship with the actor Ramon Novarro, then known by his birth name Ramón Samaniego; Samaniego broke off the affair when he started to become successful in his acting career.[6]
By 1925, Partch was putting his theory into practice by developing paper coverings for violin and viola with fingerings in just intonation, and wrote a string quartet using such tunings.  He put his theories in words in May 1928 in the first draft for a book, then called Exposition of Monophony.[5]  He supported himself during this time doing a variety of jobs, including teaching piano, proofreading, and working as a sailor.[4]  In New Orleans in 1930, he resolved to break with the European tradition entirely, and burned all his earlier scores in a potbelly stove.[4]
Partch had a New Orleans violin maker build a viola with the fingerboard of a cello.  He used this instrument, dubbed the Adapted Viola, to write music using a scale with twenty-nine tones to the octave.[4]  Partch's earliest work to survive comes from this period, including works based on Biblical verse and Shakespeare, and Seventeen Lyrics of Li Po based on translations of the Chinese poetry of Li Bai.[a][7]  In 1932, Partch performed the music in San Francisco and Los Angeles with sopranos he had recruited.[4]  A February 9, 1932, performance at Henry Cowell's New Music Society of California attracted reviews.  A private group of sponsors sent Partch to New York in 1933, where he gave solo performances and won the support of composers Roy Harris, Charles Seeger, Henry Cowell, Howard Hanson, Otto Luening, Walter Piston, and Aaron Copland.[8]
Partch unsuccessfully applied for Guggenheim grants in 1933 and 1934.  The Carnegie Corporation of New York granted him $1500 so he could do research in England.  He gave readings at the British Museum and traveled in Europe.  He met W. B. Yeats in Dublin, whose translation of Sophocles' King Oedipus he wanted to set to his music;[8] he studied the spoken inflection in Yeats's recitation of the text.[9]  He built a keyboard instrument, the Chromatic Organ, which used a scale with forty-three tones to the octave.[8]  He met musicologist Kathleen Schlesinger, who had recreated an ancient Greek kithara from images she found on a vase at the British Museum.  Partch made sketches of the instrument in her home,[10] and discussed ancient Greek music theory with her.[11]
Partch returned to the U.S. in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression, and spent a transient nine years, often as a hobo, often picking up work or obtaining grants from organizations such as the Federal Writers' Project.[8]  For the first eight months of this period, he kept a journal which was published posthumously as Bitter Music.[12]  Partch included notation on the speech inflections of people he met in his travels.[9]  He continued to compose music, build instruments, and develop his book and theories, and make his first recordings.[8]  He had alterations made by sculptor and designer friend Gordon Newell to the Kithara sketches he had made in England.  After taking some woodworking courses in 1938, he built his first Kithara[10] at Big Sur, California,[8] at a scale of roughly twice the size of Schlesinger's.[10]  In 1942 in Chicago, he built his Chromelodeon—another 43-tone reed organ.[8]  He was staying on the eastern coast of the U.S. when he was awarded a Guggenheim grant in March 1943 to construct instruments and complete a seven-part Monophonic Cycle.  On April 22, 1944, the first performance of his Americana series of compositions was given at Carnegie Chamber Music Hall put on by the League of Composers.[13]

University work (1947–1962)[edit]
Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947.  This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music.  Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press.  He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments.[13]
In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin into a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation,[13] and made recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949–1950).[14] He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings.[15]  In early 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College,[15] with the support of designer Arch Lauterer.[11]  Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation of Sophocles's play.[b][15]
In February 1953, Partch founded a studio, named Gate 5, in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances.  Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income.[15]  Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949–1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953.[14]
After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it.[16] Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir.[17]  In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation.[15]  Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two.  From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park[c] in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962.[16]  Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music.[14]  Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California.[16]

Later life in California (1962–1974)[edit]
Partch set up a studio in late 1962 in Petaluma, California, in a former chick hatchery. There he composed And on the Seventh Day, Petals Fell in Petaluma. He left northern California in summer 1964, and spent his remaining decade in various cities in southern California. He rarely had university work during this period, and lived on grants, commissions, and record sales.[16] A turning point in his popularity was the 1969 Columbia LP The World of Harry Partch, the first modern recording of Partch's music and his first release on a major record label.[18]
His final theater work was Delusion of the Fury,[16] which incorporated music from Petaluma,[14] and was first produced at the University of California in early 1969. In 1970, the Harry Partch Foundation was founded to handle the expenses and administration of Partch's work. His final completed work was the soundtrack to Betty Freeman's The Dreamer that Remains. He retired to San Diego in 1973, where he died after suffering a heart attack on September 3, 1974.[19] The same year, a second edition of Genesis of a Music was published with extra chapters about work and instruments Partch made since the book's original publication.[20]
In 1991, Partch's journals from June 1935 to February 1936 were discovered and published—journals that Partch had believed to have been lost or destroyed.[16] In 1998, musicologist Bob Gilmore published a biography of Partch.

Personal life[edit]
Partch was first cousins with gag cartoonist Virgil Partch (1916–1984).[21] Partch believed he was sterile due to childhood mumps,[22] and he had a romantic relationship with the film actor Ramon Novarro.[23]

Legacy[edit]

Partch met Danlee Mitchell while he was at the University of Illinois; Partch made Mitchell his heir,[17] and Mitchell serves as the executive director of the Harry Partch Foundation.[24] Dean Drummond and his group Newband took charge of Partch's instruments, and performed his repertoire.[25] After Drummond's death in 2013, Charles Corey, a former doctoral student of Drummond, assumed responsibility for the instruments.[26]
The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music in Urbana, Illinois, holds the Harry Partch Estate Archive, 1918–1991,[27] which consists of Partch's personal papers, musical scores, films, tapes and photographs documenting his career as a composer, writer, and producer. It also holds the Music and performing Arts Library Harry Partch Collection, 1914–2007,[28] which consists of books, music, films, personal papers, artifacts and sound recordings collected by the staff of the Music and Performing Arts Library and the University of Illinois School of Music documenting the life and career of Harry Partch, and those associated with him, throughout his career as a composer and writer.
Partch's notation is an obstacle, as it mixes a sort of tablature with indications of pitch ratios.  This makes it difficult for those trained in traditional Western notation, and gives no visual indication as to what the music is intended to sound like.[29]
Paul Simon used Partch's instruments in the creation of songs for his 2016 album Stranger to Stranger.[30]

Recognition[edit]
In 1974, Partch was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Percussive Arts Society, a music service organization promoting percussion education, research, performance and appreciation.[31] In 2004, U.S. Highball was selected by the Library of Congress's National Recording Preservation Board as ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[32]

Music[edit]
Theory[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (January 2013)
The 11-limit tonality diamond, part of the basis for Partch's music theory
Partch made public his theories in his book Genesis of a Music (1947).  He opens the book with an overview of music history, and argues that Western music began to suffer from the time of Bach, after which twelve-tone equal temperament was adopted to the exclusion of other tuning systems, and abstract, instrumental music became the norm.  Partch sought to bring vocal music back to prominence, and adopted tunings and scales he believed more suitable to singing.[23]
Inspired by Sensations of Tone, Hermann von Helmholtz's book on acoustics and the perception of sound, Partch based his music strictly on just intonation.  He tuned his instruments using the overtone series, and extended it up to the eleventh partial.  This allowed for a larger number of smaller, unequal intervals than found in the Western classical music tradition's twelve-tone equal temperament.  Partch's tuning is often classed as microtonality, as it allowed for intervals smaller than 100 cents, though Partch did not conceive his tuning in such a context.[33]  Instead, he saw it as a return to pre-Classical Western musical roots, in particular to the music of the ancient Greeks.  By taking the principles he found in Helmholtz's book, he expanded his tuning system until it allowed for a division of the octave into 43 tones based on ratios of small integers.[23]
Partch uses the terms Otonality and Utonality to describe chords whose pitch classes are the harmonics or subharmonics of a given fixed tone.  These six-tone chords function in Partch's music much the same that the three-tone major and minor chords (or triads) do in classical music.[25]  The Otonalities are derived from the overtone series, and the Utonalities from the undertone series.[34]
Genesis of a Music has been influential on later generations of composers interested in new intonational systems, such Ben Johnston and James Tenney (both of whom worked with Partch in the 1950s).

Style[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (December 2012)


The age of specialization has given us an art of sound that denies sound, and a science of sound that denies art. The age of specialization has given us a music drama that denies drama, and a drama that—contrary to the practices of all other peoples of the world—denies music.


Partch, in Bitter Music (2000)[35]

Partch rejected the Western concert music tradition, saying that the music of composers such as Beethoven ""has only the feeblest roots"" in Western culture.[36] His non-Western orientation was particularly pronounced—sometimes explicitly, as when he set to music the poetry of Li Bai,[37] or when he combined two Noh dramas with one from Ethiopia in The Delusion of the Fury.[38]
Partch believed that Western music of the 20th century suffered from over-specialization. He objected to the theatre of the day, which he believed had divorced music and drama, and he strove to create complete, integrated theatre works, in which he expected each performer to sing, dance, play instruments, and take on speaking parts. Partch used the words ""ritual"" and ""corporeal"" to describe his theatre works—musicians and their instruments were not hidden in an orchestra pit or offstage, but were a visual part of the performance.[39]

Rhythmic range[edit]
Partch's approach to rhythm ranged from unspecified to complex. In Seventeen Lyrics of Li Po for the Adapted Viola, Partch ""doesn't bother with rhythmic notation at all, but simply directs performers to follow the natural rhythms of the poem.""[2]  His rhythmic structures that were specified in Castor and Pollux were far more structured: ""Each of the duets last 234 beats. In the first half (Castor) the music alternates between 4 and 5 beats to a bar, and there's usually a rest on the eighth of the nine beats. In the second half (Pollux) the rhythm's a bit more complicated, with six bars of 7 beats alternating with six bars of 9 beats until 234 beats are reached.""[2]

Instruments[edit]
Main article: List of instruments by Harry Partch
Partch called himself ""a philosophic music-man seduced into carpentry"".[40]  The path towards Partch's use of various unique instruments was gradual.[41]  He began in the 1920s using traditional instruments, and wrote a string quartet in just intonation (now lost).[7]  He had his first specialized instrument built for him in 1930—the Adapted Viola, a viola with a cello's neck fitted on it.[4]
Most of Partch's works exclusively used the instruments he had created. Some works made use of unaltered standard instruments such as clarinet or cello; Revelation in the Courtyard Park (1960) used an unaltered small wind band,[40] and Yankee Doodle Fantasy (1944) used unaltered oboe and flute.[42]
In 1991, Dean Drummond became the custodian of the original Harry Partch instrument collection until his death in 2013.[43][44] In 1999 Drummond brought the instruments to Montclair State University in Montclair, New Jersey, where they resided until November 2014, when they were moved to the University of Washington, Seattle. They are currently under the care of Charles Corey, Drummond's former PhD student.[26]
In 2012 a complete set of replicas was built by Thomas Meixner under commission by Ensemble Musikfabrik and used in performances of Partch's work including Delusion of the Fury.[45]

Works[edit]
Main article: List of works by Harry Partch
The Harry Partch Ensemble (2019).
Partch's later works were large-scale, integrated theater productions in which he expected each of the performers to sing, dance, speak, and play instruments.[39]
Partch described the theory and practice of his music in his book Genesis of a Music, which he had published  first in 1947,[13] and in an expanded edition in 1974.[20]  A collection of essays, journals, and librettos by Partch was published as posthumously as Bitter Music 1991.
Partch partially supported himself with the sales of recordings, which he began making in the late 1930s.[8]  He published his recordings under the Gate 5 Records label beginning in 1953.[15]  On recordings such as the soundtrack to Windsong, he used multitrack recording, which allowed him to play all the instruments himself.  He never used synthesized or computer-generated sounds, though he had access to such technology.[40]  Partch scored six films by Madeline Tourtelot, starting with 1957's Windsong. He has been the subject of a number of documentary films.[16]

What is the TensorFlow library?,"TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning created by Google in 2015. It is a high-level computational framework for building and training machine learning models. TensorFlow is designed to be easy to use, and it allows users to write and train machine learning models using Python, which is a popular programming language in the data science and machine learning communities.

TensorFlow was created to solve the problem of training deep neural networks, which are the most powerful and effective models used in machine learning. Deep neural networks are networks of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that are designed to learn and make predictions based on large amounts of data. Training deep neural networks can be computationally expensive, and TensorFlow was designed to make this process faster and more efficient.

Some specific details about TensorFlow include:

* TensorFlow was created by researchers at Google, who were interested in solving the problem of training deep neural networks.
* TensorFlow is open-source software, which means that it is freely available to use and modify by anyone.
* TensorFlow is written in C++ and Python, which are popular programming languages in the data science and machine learning communities.
* TensorFlow can be used to build and train machine learning models for a wide range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.
* TensorFlow has a large and active community of developers and users, who contribute to the library and share their experiences and knowledge with others.
* TensorFlow has been used in a wide range of applications, including image recognition for self-driving cars, speech recognition for virtual assistants, and natural language processing for chatbots.

Overall, TensorFlow is a powerful and versatile machine learning library that has been widely adopted in the data science and machine learning communities. It is designed to be easy to use and to make machine learning accessible to a wide range of users.",True,https://www.tensorflow.org/,"

"
What is the Atacama Desert?,"The Atacama Desert is a vast, high-altitude desert located in northern Chile and southern Peru. It is one of the driest places on Earth, with very little rainfall and extremely high temperatures. The Atacama Desert is named after the Atacameños, a pre-Columbian people who inhabited the region before the arrival of Spanish colonizers.

The Atacama Desert is known for its unique geological features, including salt flats, sand dunes, and geysers. The salt flats, known as salar, are the largest in the world and are used for agriculture and mining. The sand dunes are some of the tallest in the world and are used for tourism. The geysers, known as fumeroles and fumaroli, are hot springs that emit steam and gases.

The Atacama Desert is also known for its rich history and cultural heritage. The region was inhabited by the Atacameños before the arrival of Spanish colonizers, and many archaeological sites and ruins can be found throughout the desert. The desert is also home to a variety of wildlife, including flamingoes, flamingos, and vicunas.

The Atacama Desert is also known for its extreme weather conditions. The desert is often shrouded in a thick layer of clouds, and temperatures can reach up to 50°C (122°F) during the day and drop to freezing temperatures at night. The desert is also home to some of the oldest fossils in the world, including those of dinosaurs.

Overall, the Atacama Desert is a unique and fascinating place that offers a glimpse into the region's rich history and cultural heritage, as well as its extreme weather conditions and unique geological features.",True,https://www.britannica.com/place/Atacama-Desert,"

To the north the desert continues to the border of Peru.A line of low coastal mountains, the Cordillera de la Costa, lies to the west of the desert, and to its east rises the Cordillera Domeyko, foothills of the Andes. The desert consists mainly of salt pans at the foot of the coastal mountains on the west and of alluvial fans sloping from the Andean foothills to the east; some of the fans are covered with dunes, but extensive pebble accumulations are more common.Atacama DesertThe Valley of the Moon, with Licancábur volcano in the background, Atacama Desert, Chile.(more)The coastal chain hovers around 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) or so in elevation with individual peaks reaching to 6,560 feet (2,000 metres). There is no coastal plain. Through much of their extent the mountains terminate abruptly at the sea in cliffs, some of them higher than 1,600 feet (500 metres), making communication difficult between the coastal ports and the interior. In the interior a raised depression extends north and south and forms the high Tamarugal Plain at an elevation of more than 3,000 feet (900 metres). Farther to the east in the western outliers of the Andes, preceded by the Cordillera Domeyko, there are numerous volcanic cones, some exceeding 16,000 feet (4,900 metres) in elevation. Along Chile’s northeastern frontier with Argentina and Bolivia extends the Atacama Plateau, which reaches elevations of 13,000 feet (4,000 metres).

Dry subsidence created by the South Pacific high-pressure cell makes the desert one of the driest regions in the world. Along the coast the aridity is also a consequence of the Peru (Humboldt) Current, which is characterized by upwelling (the upward movement of cold water from the depths of the ocean); the resulting cold water at the surface causes a thermal inversion—cold air at sea level and stable warmer air higher up. This condition produces fog and stratus clouds but no rain. Rains fall in Iquique or Antofagasta only when powerful southern fronts break into the subsidence area. Temperatures in the desert are relatively low compared with those in similar latitudes elsewhere. The average summer temperature at Iquique is only 66 °F (19 °C) and at Antofagasta 65 °F (18 °C).The original inhabitants of the region were Atacameño, an extinct Indian culture, different from the Aymara to the north and the Diaguita to the south. For much of the 19th century, the desert was the object of conflicts among Chile, Bolivia, and Peru because of its mineral resources, particularly sodium nitrate deposits located northeast of Antofagasta and inland from Iquique. Much of the area originally belonged to Bolivia and Peru, but the mining industry was controlled by Chilean and British interests, which were strongly supported by the Chilean government. From the War of the Pacific (1879–83), Chile emerged victorious. The Treaty of Ancón (1883) gave Chile permanent ownership of sectors previously controlled by Peru and Bolivia, the latter losing its whole Pacific coastline.The area proved to be one of the chief sources of Chile’s wealth until World War I. Nitrate deposits in the central depression and in several basins of the coastal range were systematically mined after the mid-19th century. Ports were built at Iquique, Caldera, Antofagasta, Taltal, Tocopilla, Mejillones, and, farther north, Pisagua, and railroads penetrated the mountain barriers to the interior. Prior to World War I, Chile had a world monopoly on nitrate; in some years 3,000,000 tons were extracted, and the taxes on its export amounted to half the government’s revenues. The development of synthetic methods of fixing nitrogen have since reduced the market to a regional one. Some sulfur is still mined in the high Cordillera. The region’s chief source of revenue, however, is copper mining at Chuquicamata in the Calama basin.

"
What are the specifics of the Halifax Explosion?,"The Halifax Explosion was a catastrophic maritime disaster that occurred on December 6, 1917, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It was caused by a collision between two large ships, the British steamship Mont-Blanc and the French steamship Imo, which were carrying munitions destined for the British Expeditionary Force in France.

The explosion was caused by the detonation of 12,000 tons of high-explosive munitions, which had been improperly stowed on the ships. The blast was felt as far away as Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States, and caused significant damage and loss of life in the city.

The explosion killed 2,000 people and injured tens of thousands more. It was the deadliest man-made disaster in Canadian history and had a lasting impact on the city and its residents.

The disaster was caused by a series of human errors and a lack of proper safety measures. The munitions were improperly loaded onto the ships, and the ships themselves were not equipped with adequate fire-fighting equipment or escape routes.

The Mont-Blanc was carrying a large amount of explosives, which were not properly secured and detonated when the ships collided. The explosion was massive, and it caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city.

The disaster was also a significant event in the First World War, as it occurred during the war and had a direct impact on the military and political situation. The explosion was a reminder of the dangers of war and the importance of proper safety measures and regulations.

The disaster also had a lasting impact on the city of Halifax and its residents. The city was left with significant damage and needed extensive repairs and rebuilding. The disaster also had a psychological impact on the residents, who were left to pick up the pieces after such a devastating event.

In conclusion, the Halifax Explosion was a catastrophic maritime disaster that had a significant impact on the city of Halifax and its residents. It was caused by a series of human errors and a lack of proper safety measures, and it had a lasting impact on the city and its residents.",True,https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/what-see-do/halifax-explosion,"

Halifax Explosion
 











Explosion in The Narrows: The 1917 Halifax Harbour Explosion

On the morning of December 6th, 1917, the steamship Mont-Blanc, inbound from the Atlantic with war material for France, entered the Halifax Harbour Narrows. The Norwegian ship Imo left Bedford Basin, outbound for New York to load supplies for occupied Belgium. In homes, schools, and factories lining the shores, people started a new day in a busy wartime port. When Imo crossed The Narrows and struck Mont-Blanc’s bow, worlds collided.

Kepe’kek: At the Narrows
In Mi’kma’ki—the present and ancestral territory of the Mi’kmaw people—Kjipuktuk (Halifax Harbour) is one feature of an enduring indigenous landscape comprising much of northeastern North America. The area of harbour where Imo struck Mont-Blanc was known by Mi’kmaw people as Kepe'kek, “at the Narrows.”

Canada and Global War 
Halifax is North America’s closest large port to Europe. The Narrows’ shoreline was shaped by rail lines stretching from shipping terminals into the continental interior. Residents in the communities of Richmond and Africville depended on the railway, the factories, the waterfront.

The city’s rail and shipping facilities were quickly integrated into the nation’s war effort. Hundreds of thousands of service personnel departed from Deepwater Terminals for the battlefields of Europe. Halifax was as fully engaged in the war as any North American city could be. 
Collision in The Narrows 
Mont-Blanc’s main cargo was bulk high explosives. When barrels of petrochemical on deck triggered the blast, the ship was transformed into a three-kiloton bomb in a busy modern port.

A roiling cloud of hot gas rose high above the blast. Chunks and shards of the ship fell across an eight-kilometre range. Vaporized fuel and chemicals from the explosion fell as rain, coating people and wreckage with an oily film. Richmond and the Mi’kmaw community of Turtle Grove were struck by the full force of the blast. More than 1700 people were killed by the explosion and its after-effects. At least 9000 were injured and many more were made homeless.

The Explosion immediately disrupted communications linking North America, Nova Scotia, and the world overseas. Roadways, telegraph and telephone lines, submarine cables were disrupted by the blast. Rail links to the piers, and many of the piers themselves, were destroyed.

Rescue and Relief 
People in the districts immediately surrounding the devastated area provided the first relief. Many first responders were soldiers and sailors from Canadian, British, and United States’ ships in port.
 
Queen’s University Archives, Queen’s Picture Collection, 96891 
Trinidad-born Dr. Clement Courtenay Ligoure treated survivors from the ruined factories, railyards, and rehomesof the city’s north end for weeks after the blast. Denied privileges in the city’s medical facilities because of his race, he opened a private hospital. Dr. Ligoiure was a well-known public figure, recruiting for the No. 2 Construction Battalion and editing The Atlantic Advocate, one of Canada’s first magazines produced by and for people of colour.
Six relief trains arrived from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the day of the blast. As news of the Halifax Harbour Explosion spread, people all over the world acted to relieve the mass suffering it had caused.
Commemorating Disaster 
In 1994, the museum opened “Halifax Wrecked”, a permanent exhibit devoted to the Explosion. An updated version of this exhibit, “Explosion in The Narrows”, opened in 2019, aims to broaden public understanding of the many and diverse communities—Mi’kmaw, African-Nova Scotian, recent migrant, military—affected by these events.
