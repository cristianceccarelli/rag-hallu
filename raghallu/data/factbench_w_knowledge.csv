Abstract
The surge in applications of large language models (LLMs) has prompted concerns about the generation of misleading or fabricated information, known as hallucinations. Therefore, detecting hallucinations has become critical to maintaining trust in LLM-generated content.
A primary challenge in learning a truthfulness classifier is the lack of a large amount of labeled truthful and hallucinated data. To address the challenge, we introduce HaloScope, a novel learning framework that leverages the unlabeled LLM generations in the wild for hallucination detection. Such unlabeled data arises freely upon deploying LLMs in the open world, and consists of both truthful and hallucinated information. To harness the unlabeled data, we present an automated membership estimation score for distinguishing between truthful and untruthful generations within unlabeled mixture data, thereby enabling the training of a binary truthfulness classifier on top.
Importantly, our framework does not require extra data collection and human annotations, offering strong flexibility and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiments show that HaloScope can achieve superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/haloscope.



1 Introduction

In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative forces shaping various applications¬†[35, 45]. Despite the immense capabilities, they bring forth challenges to the model‚Äôs reliability upon deployment in the open world. For example, the model can generate information that is seemingly informative but untruthful during interaction with humans, placing critical decision-making at risk¬†[19, 53]. Therefore, a reliable LLM should not only accurately generate texts that are coherent with the prompts but also possess the ability to identify hallucinations. This gives
rise to the importance of hallucination detection problem, which determines
whether a generation is truthful or not¬†[32, 6, 25].


A primary challenge in learning a truthfulness classifier is the scarcity of labeled datasets containing truthful and hallucinated generations. In practice, generating a reliable ground truth dataset for hallucination detection requires human annotators to assess the authenticity of a large number of generated samples. However, collecting such labeled data can be labor-intensive, especially considering the vast landscape of generative models and the diverse range of content they produce. Moreover, maintaining the quality and consistency of labeled data amidst the evolving capabilities and outputs of generative models requires ongoing annotation efforts and stringent quality control measures. These formidable obstacles underscore the need for exploring unlabeled data for hallucination detection.


Motivated by this, we introduce HaloScope, a novel learning framework that leverages unlabeled LLM generations in the wild for hallucination detection. The unlabeled data is easy-to-access and can emerge organically as a result of interactions with users in chat-based applications. Imagine, for example, a language model such as GPT¬†[35] deployed in the wild can produce vast quantities of text continuously in response to user prompts. This data can be freely collectible, yet often contains a mixture of truthful and potentially hallucinated content. Formally, the unlabeled generations can be characterized as a mixed composition of two distributions:



‚Ñôunlabeled=(1‚àíœÄ)‚Å¢‚Ñôtrue+œÄ‚Å¢‚Ñôhal,subscript‚Ñôunlabeled1ùúãsubscript‚Ñôtrueùúãsubscript‚Ñôhal\mathbb{P}_{\text{unlabeled}}=(1-\pi)\mathbb{P}_{\text{true}}+\pi\mathbb{P}_{%
\text{hal}},blackboard_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT unlabeled end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( 1 - italic_œÄ ) blackboard_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT true end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_œÄ blackboard_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT hal end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ,



where ‚Ñôtruesubscript‚Ñôtrue\mathbb{P}_{\text{true}}blackboard_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT true end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ‚Ñôhalsubscript‚Ñôhal\mathbb{P}_{\text{hal}}blackboard_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT hal end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denote the marginal distribution of truthful and hallucinated data, and œÄùúã\piitalic_œÄ is the mixing ratio. Harnessing the unlabeled data is non-trivial due to the lack of clear membership (truthful or hallucinated) for samples in mixture data.


Central to our framework is the design of an automated membership estimation score for distinguishing between truthful and
untruthful generations within unlabeled data, thereby enabling the training of a binary truthfulness classifier on top. Our key idea is to utilize the language model‚Äôs latent representations, which can capture information related to truthfulness. Specifically, HaloScope identifies a subspace in the activation space associated with hallucinated statements, and considers a point to be potentially hallucinated if its representation aligns strongly with the components of the subspace (see Figure¬†2). This idea can be operationalized by performing factorization on LLM embeddings, where the top singular vectors form the latent subspace for membership estimation. Specifically, the membership estimation score measures the norm of the embedding projected onto the top singular vectors, which exhibits different magnitudes for the two types of data. Our estimation score offers a straightforward mathematical interpretation and is easily implementable in practical applications.




Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed framework HaloScope for hallucination detection, leveraging unlabeled LLM generations in the wild. HaloScope first identifies the latent subspace to estimate the membership (truthful vs. hallucinated) for samples in unlabeled data ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M and then learns a binary truthfulness classifier.


Extensive experimental results on contemporary LLMs confirm that HaloScope can effectively improve hallucination detection performance across diverse datasets spanning open-book and closed-book conversational QA tasks (Section¬†4). Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, we substantially improve the hallucination detection accuracy by 10.69% (AUROC) on a challenging TruthfulQA benchmark¬†[29], which favorably matches the supervised upper bound (78.64 % vs. 81.04%).
Furthermore, we delve deeper into understanding the key components of our methodology (Section¬†4.4), and extend our inquiry to showcase HaloScope versatility in addressing real-world scenarios with practical challenges¬†(Section¬†4.3). To summarize our key contributions:

Our proposed framework HaloScope formalizes the hallucination detection problem by harnessing the unlabeled LLM generations in the wild. This formulation offers strong practicality and flexibility for real-world applications.

3 Proposed Framework: HaloScope


3.1 Unlabeled LLM Generations in the Wild

Our key idea is to leverage unlabeled LLM generations in the wild, which emerge organically as a result of interactions with users in chat-based applications. Imagine, for example, a language model such as GPT deployed in the wild can produce vast quantities of text continuously in response to user prompts. This data can be freely collectible, yet often contains a mixture of truthful and potentially hallucinated content. Formally, the unlabeled generations can be characterized by the Huber contamination model¬†[18] as follows:



Definition 3.1 (Unlabeled data distribution).


We define the unlabeled LLM input and generation pairs to be the following mixture of distributions



‚Ñôunlabeled=(1‚àíœÄ)‚Å¢‚Ñôtrue+œÄ‚Å¢‚Ñôhal,subscript‚Ñôunlabeled1ùúãsubscript‚Ñôtrueùúãsubscript‚Ñôhal\mathbb{P}_{\text{unlabeled}}=(1-\pi)\mathbb{P}_{\text{true}}+\pi\mathbb{P}_{%

where œÄ‚àà(0,1]ùúã01\pi\in(0,1]italic_œÄ ‚àà ( 0 , 1 ]. Note that the case œÄ=0ùúã0\pi=0italic_œÄ = 0 is idealistic since no false information occurs. In practice, œÄùúã\piitalic_œÄ can be a moderately small value when most of the generations remain truthful.

Despite the wide availability of unlabeled generations, harnessing such data is non-trivial due to the lack of clear membership (truthful or hallucinated) for samples in mixture data ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\mathcal{M}}caligraphic_M.
In a nutshell, our framework aims to devise an automated function that estimates the membership for samples within the unlabeled data, thereby enabling the training of a binary classifier on top (as shown in Figure¬†1). In what follows, we describe these two steps in Section¬†3.2 and Section¬†3.3 respectively.




3.2 Estimating Membership via Latent Subspace

The first step of our framework involves estimating the membership (truthful vs untruthful) for data instances within a mixture dataset ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M.
The ability to effectively assign membership for these two types of data relies heavily on whether the language model‚Äôs representations can capture information related to truthfulness. Our idea is that if we could identify a latent subspace associated with hallucinated statements, then we might be able to separate them from the rest. We describe the procedure formally below.


Embedding factorization. To realize the idea,
we extract embeddings from the language model for samples in the unlabeled mixture ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\mathcal{M}}caligraphic_M. Specifically, let ùêÖ‚àà‚ÑùN√ódùêÖsuperscript‚ÑùùëÅùëë\mathbf{F}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}bold_F ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N √ó italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT denote the matrix of embeddings extracted from the language model for samples in ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\mathcal{M}}caligraphic_M, where each row represents the embedding vector ùêüi‚ä§superscriptsubscriptùêüùëñtop\mathbf{f}_{i}^{\top}bold_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚ä§ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT of a data sample (ùê±prompti,ùê±~i)superscriptsubscriptùê±promptùëñsubscript~ùê±ùëñ(\mathbf{x}_{\text{prompt}}^{i},\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i})( bold_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT prompt end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , over~ start_ARG bold_x end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). To identify the subspace, we perform singular value decomposition:



ùêüi:=ùêüi‚àíùùÅùêÖ=ùêî‚Å¢Œ£‚Å¢ùêï‚ä§,assignsubscriptùêüùëñsubscriptùêüùëñùùÅùêÖùêîŒ£superscriptùêïtop\begin{split}\mathbf{f}_{i}&:=\mathbf{f}_{i}-\boldsymbol{\mu}\\

(5)


where ùùÅ‚àà‚ÑùdùùÅsuperscript‚Ñùùëë\boldsymbol{\mu}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}bold_italic_Œº ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is the average embedding across all NùëÅNitalic_N samples, which is used to center the embedding matrix. The columns of ùêîùêî\mathbf{U}bold_U and ùêïùêï\mathbf{V}bold_V are the left and right singular vectors, and form an orthonormal basis. In principle, the factorization can be performed on any layer of the LLM representations, which will be analyzed in Section¬†4.4. Such a factorization is useful, because it enables discovering the most important spanning direction of the subspace for the set of points in ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥{\mathcal{M}}caligraphic_M.

Visualization of the representations for truthful (in orange) and hallucinated samples (in purple), and their projection onto the top singular vector ùêØ1subscriptùêØ1\mathbf{v}_{1}bold_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (in gray dashed line).




Membership estimation via latent subspace.

To gain insight, we begin with a special case of the problem where the subspace is 1111-dimensional, a line through the origin.
Finding the best-fitting line through the origin with respect to a set of points {ùêüi|1‚â§i‚â§N}conditional-setsubscriptùêüùëñ1ùëñùëÅ\{\mathbf{f}_{i}|1\leq i\leq N\}{ bold_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 1 ‚â§ italic_i ‚â§ italic_N } means minimizing the sum of the squared distances of the points to the line. ¬†Here, distance is measured perpendicular to the line. Geometrically, finding the first singular vector ùêØ1subscriptùêØ1\mathbf{v}_{1}bold_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is also equivalent to maximizing the total distance from the projected embedding (onto the direction of ùêØ1subscriptùêØ1\mathbf{v}_{1}bold_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) to the origin (sum over all points in ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M):

where ‚ü®‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ‚ü©‚ãÖ‚ãÖ\left<\cdot,\cdot\right>‚ü® ‚ãÖ , ‚ãÖ ‚ü© is a dot product operator.
As illustrated in Figure¬†2, hallucinated data samples may exhibit anomalous behavior compared to truthful generation, and locate farther away from the center. This reflects the practical scenarios when a small to moderate amount of generations are hallucinated while the majority remain truthful. To assign the membership, we define the estimation score as
Œ∂i=‚ü®ùêüi,ùêØ1‚ü©2subscriptùúÅùëñsuperscriptsubscriptùêüùëñsubscriptùêØ12\zeta_{i}=\left<\mathbf{f}_{i},\mathbf{v}_{1}\right>^{2}italic_Œ∂ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ‚ü® bold_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , bold_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, which measures the norm of ùêüisubscriptùêüùëñ\mathbf{f}_{i}bold_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT projected onto the top singular vector. This allows us to estimate the membership based on the relative magnitude of the score (see the score distribution on practical datasets in Appendix¬†B).


Our membership estimation score offers a clear mathematical interpretation and is easily implementable in practical applications.
Furthermore, the definition of score can be generalized to leverage a subspace of kùëòkitalic_k orthogonal singular vectors:



Œ∂i=1k‚Å¢‚àëj=1kœÉj‚ãÖ‚ü®ùêüi,ùêØj‚ü©2,subscriptùúÅùëñ1ùëòsuperscriptsubscriptùëó1ùëò‚ãÖsubscriptùúéùëósuperscriptsubscriptùêüùëñsubscriptùêØùëó2\zeta_{i}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k}\sigma_{j}\cdot\left<\mathbf{f}_{i},\mathbf%

(7)


where ùêØjsubscriptùêØùëó\mathbf{v}_{j}bold_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the jthsuperscriptùëóthj^{\text{th}}italic_j start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT th end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT column of ùêïùêï\mathbf{V}bold_V, and œÉjsubscriptùúéùëó\sigma_{j}italic_œÉ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the corresponding singular value. kùëòkitalic_k is the number of spanning directions in the subspace.
The intuition is that hallucinated samples can be captured by a small subspace, allowing them to be distinguished from the truthful samples. We show in
Section¬†4.4 that leveraging subspace with multiple components can capture the truthfulness encoded in LLM activations more effectively

To make the 0/1010/10 / 1 loss tractable, we replace it with the

4 Experiments

In this section, we present empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our method on various hallucination detection tasks. We describe the setup in Section¬†4.1, followed by the results and comprehensive analysis in Section¬†4.2‚ÄìSection¬†4.4.



4.1 Setup

Datasets and models.
We consider four generative question-answering (QA) tasks for evaluation, including two open-book conversational QA datasets CoQA¬†[37] and TruthfulQA¬†[29] (generation track), closed-book QA dataset TriviaQA¬†[20], and reading comprehension dataset TydiQA-GP (English)¬†[9]. Specifically, we have 817 and 3,696 QA pairs for TruthfulQA and TydiQA-GP datasets, respectively, and follow¬†[30] to utilize the development split of
CoQA with 7,983 QA pairs, and the deduplicated validation split of
the TriviaQA (rc.nocontext subset) with 9,960 QA pairs. We reserve 25% of the available QA pairs for testing and 100 QA pairs for validation, and the remaining questions are used to simulate the unlabeled generations in the wild. By default, the generations are based on greedy sampling, which predicts the most probable token. Additional sampling strategies are studied in Appendix¬†E.


We evaluate our method using two families of models: LLaMA-2-chat-7B & 13B¬†[45] and OPT-6.7B & 13B¬†[50], which are popularly adopted public foundation models with accessible internal representations. Following the convention, we use
the pre-trained weights and conduct zero-shot inference in all cases. More dataset and inference details are provided in Appendix¬†A.


Baselines.

We compare our approach with a comprehensive collection of baselines, categorized as follows: (1) uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches‚ÄìPerplexity¬†[38], Length-Normalized Entropy (LN-entropy)¬†[31] and Semantic Entropy¬†[23]; (2) consistency-based methods‚ÄìLexical Similarity¬†[30], SelfCKGPT¬†[32] and EigenScore¬†[6]; (3) prompting-based strategies‚ÄìVerbalize¬†[28] and Self-evaluation¬†[21]; and (4) knowledge discovery-based method Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS)¬†[5].
To ensure a fair comparison, we assess all baselines on identical test data, employing the default experimental configurations as outlined in their respective papers. We discuss the implementation details for baselines in Appendix¬†A.



Evaluation.

Consistent with previous studies¬†[32, 23], we evaluate the effectiveness of all methods by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve
(AUROC), which measures the performance of a binary classifier under varying thresholds. The generation is deemed truthful when the similarity score between the generation and the ground truth exceeds a
given threshold of 0.5. We follow Lin et al.¬†[29] and use the BLUERT¬†[40] to measure the similarity,
a learned metric built upon BERT¬†[11] and is augmented with diverse lexical and semantic-level supervision signals.
Additionally, we show the results are robust under a different similarity measure ROUGE¬†[27] following Kuhn et al.¬†[23] in Appendix¬†D, which is based on substring matching.



Implementation details.

Following [23], we generate the most likely answer by beam search with 5 beams for evaluation, and use multinomial sampling to generate 10 samples per question with a temperature of 0.5 for baselines that require multiple generations. Following literature¬†[6, 2], we prepend the question to the generated answer and use the last-token embedding to identify the subspace and train the truthfulness classifier. The truthfulness classifier ùê†ùúΩsubscriptùê†ùúΩ\mathbf{g}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}bold_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_Œ∏ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is a two-layer MLP with ReLU non-linearity and an intermediate dimension of 1,024. We train ùê†ùúΩsubscriptùê†ùúΩ\mathbf{g}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}bold_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_Œ∏ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for 50 epochs with SGD optimizer, an initial learning rate of 0.05, cosine learning rate decay, batch size of 512, and weight decay of 3e-4. The layer index for representation extraction, the number of singular vectors kùëòkitalic_k, and the filtering threshold TùëáTitalic_T are determined using the separate validation set.

Table 1: Main results. Comparison with competitive hallucination detection methods on different datasets.
All values
are percentages (AUROC). ‚ÄúSingle sampling‚Äù indicates whether the approach requires multiple generations during inference. Bold numbers are superior results. 


As shown in Table¬†1, we compare our method HaloScope with competitive hallucination detection methods, where HaloScope outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin in both LLaMA-2-7b-chat and OPT-6.7b models. We observe that HaloScope outperforms uncertainty-based and consistency-based baselines, exhibiting 16.47% and 26.71% improvement over Semantic Entropy and EigenScore on the challenging TruthfulQA task. From a computation perspective, uncertainty-based and consistency-based approaches typically require sampling multiple generations per question during testing time, incurring an aggregate time complexity O‚Å¢(K‚Å¢m2)ùëÇùêæsuperscriptùëö2O(Km^{2})italic_O ( italic_K italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) where KùêæKitalic_K is the number of repeated sampling, and mùëömitalic_m is the number of generated tokens.
In contrast, HaloScope does not require sampling multiple generations and thus is significantly more efficient in inference, with a standard complexity O‚Å¢(m2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëö2O(m^{2})italic_O ( italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) for transformer-based sequence generation. We also notice that prompting language models to assess the factuality of their generations is not effective because of the overconfidence issue discussed in prior work¬†[54]. Lastly, we compare HaloScope with CCS¬†[5], which trains a binary truthfulness classifier to satisfy logical consistency properties, such that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. Different from our framework, CCS does not leverage LLM generations but instead human-written answers, and does not involve a membership estimation process. For a fair comparison, we implemented an improved version CCS*, which trains the binary classifier using the LLM generations (the same as those in HaloScope).
The result shows that HaloScope significantly outperforms CCS‚àó, suggesting the advantage of our membership estimation score. Moreover, we find that CCS‚àó performs better than CCS in most cases. This highlights the importance of harnessing LLM generations for hallucination detection, which better captures the distribution of model-generated content than human-written data.




4.3 Robustness to Practical Challenge

HaloScope is a practical framework that may face real-world challenges. In this section, we explore how well HaloScope deals with different data distributions, and its scalability to larger LLMs.


Does HaloScope generalize across varying data distributions?

We explore whether HaloScope can effectively generalize to different data distributions. This investigation involves directly applying the extracted subspace from one dataset (referred to as the source (s)) and computing the membership assignment score on different datasets (referred to as the target (t)) for truthfulness classifier training. The results depicted in Figure¬†3 (a) showcase the robust transferability of our approach HaloScope across diverse datasets. Notably, HaloScope achieves a hallucination detection AUROC of 76.26% on TruthfulQA when the subspace is extracted from the TriviaQA dataset, demonstrating performance close to that obtained directly from TruthfulQA (78.64%). This strong transferability underscores the potential of our method to facilitate real-world LLM applications, particularly in scenarios where user prompts may undergo domain shifts. In such contexts, HaloScope remains highly effective in detecting hallucinations, offering flexibility and adaptability.

Ablation in (b) & (c) are based on TruthfulQA. 



HaloScope scales effectively to larger LLMs.

To illustrate effectiveness with larger LLMs, we evaluate our approach on the LLaMA-2-13b-chat and OPT-13b models. The results of our method HaloScope, presented in Table¬†2, not only surpass two competitive baselines but also exhibit improvement over results obtained with smaller LLMs. For instance, HaloScope achieves an AUROC of 82.41% on the TruthfulQA dataset for the OPT-13b model, compared to 73.17% for the OPT-6.7b model, representing a direct 9.24% improvement.

4.4 Ablation Study

In this section, we conduct a series of in-depth analyses to understand the various design choices for our algorithm HaloScope. Additional ablation studies are discussed in Appendix¬†C-G.


How do different layers impact HaloScope‚Äôs performance?

In Figure¬†3 (c), we delve into hallucination detection using representations extracted from different layers within the LLM. The AUROC values of truthful/hallucinated classification are evaluated based on the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model. All other configurations are kept the same as our main experimental setting. We observe a notable trend that the hallucination detection performance initially increases from the top to middle layers (e.g., 8-14th layers), followed by a subsequent decline. This trend suggests a gradual capture of contextual information by LLMs in the first few layers, followed by a tendency towards overconfidence in the final layers due to the autoregressive training objective aimed at vocabulary mapping. This observation echoes prior findings that indicate representations at intermediate layers¬†[6, 2] are the most effective for downstream tasks.



Where to extract embeddings from multi-head attention?

Moving forward, we investigate the multi-head attention (MHA) architecture‚Äôs effect on representing hallucination. Specifically, the MHA can be conceptually expressed as:



ùêüi+1=ùêüi+ùêêi‚Å¢Attni‚Å°(ùêüi),subscriptùêüùëñ1subscriptùêüùëñsubscriptùêêùëñsubscriptAttnùëñsubscriptùêüùëñ\mathbf{f}_{i+1}=\mathbf{f}_{i}+\mathbf{Q}_{i}\operatorname{Attn}_{i}(\mathbf{%

where ùêüisubscriptùêüùëñ\mathbf{f}_{i}bold_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denotes the output of the iùëñiitalic_i-th transformer block, Attni‚Å°(ùêüi)subscriptAttnùëñsubscriptùêüùëñ\operatorname{Attn}_{i}(\mathbf{f}_{i})roman_Attn start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) denotes the output of the self-attention module in the iùëñiitalic_i-th block, and ùêêisubscriptùêêùëñ\mathbf{Q}_{i}bold_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the weight of the feedforward layer. Consequently, we evaluate the hallucination detection performance utilizing representations from three different locations within the MHA architecture, as delineated in Table¬†3.

Table 3: Hallucination detection results on different representation locations of multi-head attention. 


We observe that the LLaMA model tends to encode the hallucination information mostly in the output of the transformer block while the most effective location for OPT models is the output of the feedforward layer, and we implement our hallucination detection algorithm based on this observation for our main results in Section¬†4.2.



Ablation on different design choices of membership score.

We systematically explore different design choices for the scoring function (Equation¬†7) aimed at distinguishing between truthful and untruthful generations within unlabeled data. Specifically, we investigate the following aspects:
(1) The impact of the number of subspace components kùëòkitalic_k; (2) The significance of the weight coefficient associated with the singular value œÉùúé\sigmaitalic_œÉ in the scoring function; and (3) A comparison between score calculation based on the best individual LLM layer versus summing up layer-wise scores. Figure¬†3 (b) depicts the hallucination detection performance with varying kùëòkitalic_k values (ranging from 1 to 10). Overall, we observe superior performance with a moderate value of kùëòkitalic_k. These findings align with our assumption that hallucinated samples may be represented by a small subspace, suggesting that only a few key directions in the activation space are capable of distinguishing hallucinated samples from truthful ones. Additionally, we present results obtained from LLaMA and OPT models when employing a non-weighted scoring function (œÉj=1subscriptùúéùëó1\sigma_{j}=1italic_œÉ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 1 in Equation¬†7) in Table¬†4. We observe that the scoring function weighted by the singular value outperforms the non-weighted version, highlighting the importance of prioritizing top singular vectors over others. Lastly, summing up layer-wise scores results in significantly worse detection performance, which can be explained by the low separability between truthful and hallucinated data in the top and bottom layers of LLMs.

Figure 4: Comparison with using direction projection for hallucination detection. Value is AUROC.



What if directly using the membership score for detection?

Figure¬†4 showcases the performance of directly detecting hallucination using the score defined in Equation¬†7, which involves projecting the representation of a test sample to the extracted subspace and bypasses the training of the binary classifier as detailed in Section¬†3.3. On all four datasets, HaloScope demonstrates superior performance compared to this direct projection approach on LLaMA, highlighting the efficacy of leveraging unlabeled data for training and the enhanced generalizability of the truthfulness classifier.


Figure 5: Comparison with ideal performance when training on labeled data. 



Comparison with training on labeled data.

We further benchmark our approach against a supervised oracle, where each generation in ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M is explicitly labeled as truthful or hallucinated similar to¬†[2, 13, 26], and a binary classifier is trained based on representations of the labeled data. This enables us to assess the performance gap between HaloScope and the upper bound. In Figure¬†5, we compare our approach with the supervised oracle on the same test set and report the AUROC metric. The results, based on the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model, demonstrate that our method achieves hallucination detection accuracy on TruthfulQA (AUROC: 78.64%) that favorably matches the performance of the supervised oracle (AUROC: 81.04%). This is encouraging considering that our method does not rely on any manual annotation.



Qualitative results.

We provide qualitative examples of the model‚Äôs truthfulness score (as introduced in Section¬†3.3) for different generated texts given the same input prompts during inference (Figure¬†6). The model is LLaMA-2-chat-13b and we utilize questions in TruthfulQA that can cause misconception even for humans, for example, Q: Who first started Tesla Motors? We find that HaloScope can accurately produce the scores that align with the truthfulness of the answers (the higher the score, the more truthful the answer is).


Figure 6: Examples from TruthfulQA that show the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, we compare the truthfulness scores S‚Å¢(ùê±‚Ä≤)ùëÜsuperscriptùê±‚Ä≤S(\mathbf{x}^{\prime})italic_S ( bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) (Section¬†3.3) of HaloScope with different answers to the prompt. The green check mark and red cross indicate the ground truth of being truthful vs. hallucinated.






5 Related Work

Hallucination detection has gained interest recently for ensuring LLMs‚Äô safety and reliability¬†[15, 16, 19, 53, 48, 51, 7, 33, 17, 38, 46]. The majority of work performs hallucination detection by devising uncertainty scoring functions, including those based on the logits¬†[31, 23, 14] that assumed hallucinations would be generated by flat token log probabilities, and methods that are based on the output texts, which either measured the consistency of multiple generated texts ¬†[32, 1, 34, 47, 10] or prompted LLMs to evaluate the confidence on their generations¬†[21, 47, 39, 28, 43, 54]. Additionally, there is growing interest in exploring the LLM activations to determine whether an LLM generation is true or false¬†[42, 49, 36]. For example, Chen et al.¬†[6] performed eigendecomposition with activations but the decomposition was done on the covariance matrix that required multiple generation steps to measure the consistency. Zou et al.¬†[55] explored probing meaningful direction from neural activations. Our approach is different in three aspects: 1) HaloScope estimates the membership for unlabeled data by identifying the hallucination subspace rather than a single direction in ¬†[55], which can capture the truthfulness encoded in LLM activations more effectively (evidenced in Figure¬†3); 2) HaloScope trains a truthfulness classifier based on membership estimation results, where the explicit training procedure brings more benefits for generalizable hallucination detection compared to direct projection in¬†[55] (Section¬†4.4); and 3) our paper conducts comprehensive and in-depth evaluation on common benchmarks, thus offering more practical insights than¬†[55]. Another branch of works, such as Li, Duan and Azaria et al.¬†[26, 13, 2], employed labeled data for extracting truthful directions, which differs from our scope on harnessing unlabeled LLM generations. Note that our studied problem is different from the research on hallucination mitigation¬†[24, 44, 52, 22, 41, 8], which aims to enhance the truthfulness of LLMs‚Äô decoding process.¬†[4, 12, 3] utilized unlabeled data for out-of-distribution detection, where the approach and problem formulation are different from ours.




6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework HaloScope for hallucination detection, which exploits the unlabeled LLM generations arising in the wild. HaloScope first estimates the membership (truthful vs. hallucinated) for samples in the unlabeled mixture data based on an embedding factorization, and then trains a binary truthfulness classifier on top. The empirical result shows that HaloScope establishes superior performance on a comprehensive set of question-answering datasets and different families of LLMs. Our in-depth quantitative and qualitative ablations provide further insights on the
efficacy of HaloScope. We hope our work will inspire future research on hallucination detection with unlabeled LLM generations, where a promising future work can be investigating how to train the hallucination classifier in order to generalize well with a distribution shift between the unlabeled data and the test data.

TydiQA-GP


Implementation details for baselines. For Perplexity method¬†[38], we follow the implementation here111https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perplexity, and calculate the average perplexity score in terms of the generated tokens. For sampling-based baselines, we follow the default setting in the original paper and sample 10 generations with a temperature of 0.5 to estimate the uncertainty score. Specifically, for Lexical Similarity¬†[30], we use the Rouge-L as the similarity metric, and for SelfCKGPT¬†[32], we adopt the NLI version as recommended in their codebase222https://github.com/potsawee/selfcheckgpt, which is a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model to measure the probability of ‚Äúentailment‚Äù or ‚Äúcontradiction‚Äù between the most-likely generation and the sampled generations. For promoting-based baselines, we adopt the following prompt for Verbalize¬†[28] on the open-book QA datasets:
Q: [question] A:[answer]. \n The proposed answer is true with a confidence value (0-100) of ,
and the prompt of
Context: [Context] Q: [question] A:[answer]. \n The proposed answer is true with a confidence value (0-100) of ,
for datasets with context. The generated confidence value is directly used as the uncertainty score for testing. For the Self-evaluation approach¬†[21], we follow the original paper and utilize the prompt for the open-book QA task as follows:
Question: [question] \n Proposed Answer: [answer] \n Is the proposed answer: \n (A) True \n (B) False \n The proposed answer is:
For datasets with context, we have the prompt of:
Context: [Context] \n Question: [question] \n Proposed Answer: [answer] \n Is the proposed answer: \n (A) True \n (B) False \n The proposed answer is:
We use the log probability of output token ‚ÄúA‚Äù as the uncertainty score for evaluating hallucination detection performance following the original paper.




Appendix B Distribution of the Membership Estimation Score

Figure 7: Distribution of membership estimation score.


We show in Figure¬†7 the distribution of the membership estimation score (as defined in Equation¬†7 of the main paper) for the truthful and hallucinations in the unlabeled LLM generations of TydiQA-GP. Specifically, we visualize the score calculated using the LLM representations from the 14-th layer of LLaMA-2-chat-7b. The result demonstrates a reasonable separation between the two types of data, and can benefit the downstream training of the truthfulness classifier.





Appendix C Results with Rouge-L

In our main paper, the generation is deemed truthful when the BLUERT score between the generation and the ground truth exceeds a given threshold. In this ablation, we show that the results are robust under a different similarity measure Rouge-L, following¬†[23, 6].
Consistent with Section¬†4.1, the threshold is set to be 0.5.
With the same experimental setup, the results on the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model are shown in Table¬†5, where the effectiveness of our approach still holds.

Appendix D Results with a Different Dataset Split

We verify the performance of our approach using a different random split of the dataset. Consistent with our main experiment, we randomly split 25% of the available QA pairs for testing using a different seed. HaloScope can achieve similar hallucination detection performance to the results in our main Table¬†1. For example, on the LLaMA-2-chat-7b model, our method achieves an AUROC of 76.39% and 94.89% on TruthfulQA and TydiQA-GP datasets, respectively (Table¬†6). Meanwhile, HaloScope is able to outperform the baselines as well, which shows the statistical significance of our approach.

are percentages. ‚ÄúSingle sampling‚Äù indicates whether the approach requires multiple generations during inference. Bold numbers are superior results. 




Appendix E Ablation on Sampling Strategies

We evaluate the hallucination detection result when HaloScope identifies the hallucination subspace using LLM generations under different sampling strategies. In particular, our main results are obtained based on beam search, i.e., greedy sampling, which generates the next token based on the maximum likelihood.
In addition, we compare with multinomial sampling with a temperature of 0.5. Specifically, we sample one answer for each question and extract their embeddings for subspace identification (Section¬†3.2), and then keep the truthfulness classifier training the same as in Section¬†3.3 for test-time hallucinations detection. The comparison in Table¬†7 shows similar performance between the two sampling strategies, with greedy sampling being slightly better.

Appendix F Results with Less Unlabeled Data

In this section, we ablate on the effect of the number of unlabeled LLM generations NùëÅNitalic_N. Specifically, on TruthfulQA, we randomly sample 100-500 generations from the current unlabeled split of the dataset (NùëÅNitalic_N=512) with an interval of 100, where the corresponding experimental result on LLaMA-2-chat-7b model is presented in Table¬†8. We observe that the hallucination detection performance slightly degrades when NùëÅNitalic_N decreases. Given that unlabeled data is easy and cheap to collect in practice, our results suggest that it‚Äôs more desirable to leverage a sufficiently large sample size.

Appendix G Results of Using Other Uncertainty Scores for Filtering

We compare our HaloScope with training the truthfulness classifier by membership estimation with other uncertainty estimation scores. We follow the same setting as HaloScope and select the threshold TùëáTitalic_T and other key hyperparameters using the same validation set. The comparison is shown in Table¬†9, where the stronger performance of HaloScope vs. using other uncertainty scores for training can precisely highlight the benefits of our membership estimation approach by the hallucination subspace. The model we use is LLaMA-2-chat-7b.

Appendix H Results on Additional Tasks

We evaluate our approach on two additional tasks, which are (1) text continuation and (2) text summarization tasks. For text continuation, following¬†[32], we use LLM-generated articles for a specific concept from the WikiBio dataset. We evaluate under the sentence-level hallucination detection task and split the entire 1,908 sentences in a 3:1 ratio for unlabeled generations and test data. (The other implementation details are the same as in our main Table¬†1.)


For text summarization, we sample 1,000 entries from the HaluEval¬†[25] dataset (summarization track) and split them in a 3:1 ratio for unlabeled generations and test data. We prompt the LLM with ‚Äù[document] \n Please summarize the above article concisely. A:‚Äù and record the generations while keeping the other implementation details the same as the text continuation task.


The comparison on LLaMA-2-7b with three representative baselines is shown below. We found that the advantage of leveraging unlabeled LLM generations for hallucination detection still holds.

Appendix I Broader Impact and Limitations

Broader Impact. Large language models (LLMs) have undeniably become a prevalent tool in
both academic and industrial settings, and ensuring trust in LLM-generated content for safe usage has emerged as a paramount
concern. In this line of thought, our paper offers a novel approach HaloScope to detect LLM hallucinations by leveraging the in-the-wild unlabeled data. Given the
simplicity and versatility of our methodology, we expect our work to have a positive impact on the
AI safety domain, and envision its potential usage in industry settings. For instance, within the chat-based platforms, the service providers could seamlessly integrate HaloScope to automatically examine the factuality of the LLM generations before information delivery to users. Such applications will enhance the reliability of AI systems in the current foundation model era.


Limitations. Our new algorithmic framework aims to detect LLM hallucinations by harnessing the unlabeled LLM generations in the open world, and works by devising a scoring function in the representation subspace for estimating the membership of the unlabeled instances. While HaloScope offers a straightforward solution to leveraging the unlabeled data for training, its effectiveness is still somewhat affected by the drastic distribution shift between the unlabeled data and the test data. Therefore, a distributionally robust algorithm for training the hallucination classifier is a promising future work.




Appendix J Software and Hardware

We run all experiments with Python 3.8.5 and PyTorch 1.13.1, using NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.

"
What is the naming convention for elements in the Periodic Table?,"The naming convention for elements in the Periodic Table is based on their atomic number, which represents the number of protons in their nucleus. Each element is identified by a unique name and symbol, typically consisting of one or two letters. The names of elements are often derived from a variety of sources, including their properties, their discoverer or place of discovery, mythology, and even famous scientists. For example, oxygen is named after the Greek word ""oxys,"" meaning ""acid,"" due to its ability to form acidic compounds, while helium is named after the Greek god of the sun, Helios, due to its discovery during a solar eclipse.",False,https://www.thoughtco.com/how-are-elements-named-606639,"

Updated on February 04, 2020

 Do you know which element is azote, with the symbol Az? Element names are not the same in every country. Many countries have adopted the element names that have been agreed upon by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). According to the IUPAC, ""elements can be named after a mythological concept, a mineral, a place or country, a property, or a scientist"".


 Until relatively recently, if you looked at the periodic table, you would see some of the higher numbered elements only numbers instead of names or else their names were just another way of saying the number (e.g., Ununoctium for element 118, which is now named oganesson). The discovery of these elements hadn't been sufficiently documented for the IUPAC to feel a name is justified yet, or else there was a dispute over who gets credit for the discovery (and the honor of selecting an official name). So, how did the elements get their names and why are they different on some periodic tables?


Key Takeaways: How Elements Are Named
Official element names and symbols are determined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).However, elements often have common names and symbols in various countries.Elements don't gain official names and symbols until after their discovery has been verified. Then, a name and symbol may be proposed by the discoverer.Some element groups have naming conventions. Halogen names end with -ine. Except for helium, noble gas names end with -on. Most other element names end with -ium.
  Early Element Names  
 Early humans couldn't distinguish between elements and compounds. The earliest elements included things that were mixtures, such as air and fire. People had various names for true elements. Some of these regional differences converged into accepted names, but old symbols persist. For example, the name for gold is universal, but its symbol is Au, which reflects an earlier name of aurum. Sometimes countries held onto old names. So, Germans may call hydrogen ""Wasserstoff"" for ""water substance"" or nitrogen may be called ""Stickstoff"" for ""smothering substance."" People who speak romance languages called nitrogen ""azote"" or ""azot"" from words which mean ""no life.""


  IUPAC International Names  
 Eventually, it made sense to establish an international system for naming elements and assigning their symbols. The IUPAC set up official names of chemical elements, drawing on the English language. So, the official name for the element with atomic number 13 became aluminum. The official name for element 16 became sulfur. The official names are used in international publications, but it's still common to see researchers using names accepted in their home countries. Most of the world calls element 13 aluminium. Sulphur is an accepted name for sulfur.


  Naming Rules and Conventions  
 Certain rules apply to the usage of element names:


 Element names are not proper nouns. When the IUPAC name is used, it is written in lowercase letters unless the name begins a sentence.Element symbols are one- or two-letter symbols. The first letter is capitalized. The second letter is lowercase. An example is the symbol for chromium, which is Cr.Halogen element names have an -ine ending. Examples include chlorine, bromine, astatine, and tennessine.Nobel gas names end with -on. Examples include neon, krypton, and oganesson. The exception to this rule is the name of helium, which predates the convention.Newly discovered elements may be named for a person, place, mythological reference, property, or mineral. Examples include einsteinium (named for Albert Einstein), californium (named for California), helium (named for the sun god Helios), and calcium (named for the mineral calyx).Elements are named by their official discoverer. In order for an element to get an name, its discovery must be verified. In the past, this has led to considerable controversy, as the identity of the discoverer has been debated.Once an element discovery is confirmed, the person or lab responsible for the discovery submits a proposed name and symbol to the IUPAC. The name and symbol aren't always approved. Sometimes this is because the symbol is too close to another well known abbreviation or else the name doesn't follow other conventions. So, the symbol for tennessine is Ts and not Tn, which closely resembles the state abbreviation TN.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




Elizabeth II delivering a speech at the official opening of the Borders Railway, on the day she became the longest-reigning British monarch.
The following is a list, ordered by length of reign, of the monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1927‚Äìpresent), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801‚Äì1922), the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707‚Äì1801), the Kingdom of England (871‚Äì1707), the Kingdom of Scotland (878‚Äì1707), the Kingdom of Ireland (1542‚Äì1800), and the Principality of Wales (1216‚Äì1542).
Queen Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning monarch in British history on 9 September 2015 when she surpassed the reign of her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria.[1][2] On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to celebrate a Sapphire Jubilee, commemorating 65 years on the throne. On 6 February 2022, Elizabeth II became the first British monarch to reign for 70 years, and large-scale celebrations for her Platinum Jubilee occurred on 2 to 5 June. Later that year, Elizabeth II died at the age of 96, after reigning for 70 years and 214 days.[3]


Elizabeth II: the longest-reigning monarch[edit]
On 9 September 2015, Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-reigning known female monarch in world history.[4][5] On 23 May 2016, her reign surpassed the claimed reign of James Francis Edward Stuart (nicknamed ""the Old Pretender"").[6] On 6 February 2022 (at the age of 95¬†years, 291¬†days), she became the first British monarch to reign for 70 years and celebrate a platinum jubilee.[7]

Ten longest-reigning British monarchs[edit]
These are the ten longest-reigning monarchs in the British Isles for whom there is reliable recorded evidence.

The High King of Ireland (846‚Äì1198) was primarily a titular ruler (with the exception of Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair who was regarded as the first ""King of Ireland""). The later Kingdom of Ireland (1542‚Äì1800) came into being under the Crown of Ireland Act 1542, the long title of which was ""An Act that the King of England, his Heirs and Successors, be Kings of Ireland"". In 1801 the Irish crown became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

List of the Principalities[edit]
Gwynedd (incomplete list)[edit]
See also: List of rulers of Gwynedd
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (December 2019)
The Principality (or Kingdom) of Gwynedd (5th century‚Äì1216), located in northwest Wales, was one of the most prominent early medieval Welsh kingdoms. Its rulers were often acclaimed as ""King of the Britons,"" symbolizing their influence over other Welsh territories and their resistance to external threats. Gwynedd faced repeated challenges, including civil wars, Saxon incursions, and Norman invasions, which gradually eroded its dominance. In 1216, it transitioned into the Principality of Wales, although the title ""Prince of Wales"" was not formally adopted until the 1240s under the leadership of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, also known as Llywelyn the Last.
Gwynedd‚Äôs heartland was the mountainous region of Snowdonia, which provided natural defenses and contributed to its resilience against invaders. The kingdom played a central role in preserving Welsh identity, language, and culture during a period of significant upheaval in Britain.

The Principality of Wales (1216‚Äì1542) was a client state of England for much of its history, except for brief periods when it was de facto independent under a Welsh Prince of Wales (see House of Aberffraw). From 1301 it was first used as a title of the English (and later British) heir apparent. The Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 formally incorporated all of Wales within the Kingdom of England.

What is the colour of the most cited NLP research paper?,"The most cited NLP research paper is ""Attention Is All You Need"" by Vaswani et al., which was published in 2017. As a language model, I do not have access to visual information like colors, so I cannot tell you the color of the paper. However, the paper was published in the Proceedings of the 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2017), and the cover of the proceedings book that year was blue. So it's possible that the paper's cover page was also blue, but this is purely speculative.",False,https://medium.com/@vered1986/tips-for-writing-nlp-papers-9c729a2f9e1f,"Tips for Writing NLP Papers. Over the years I‚Äôve developed a certain‚Ä¶ | by Vered Shwartz | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inTips for Writing NLP PapersVered Shwartz¬∑Follow10 min read¬∑Aug 16, 2023--8ListenShareOver the years I‚Äôve developed a certain standard for writing papers (and doing research in general) that I share verbally with my students. I recently realized I‚Äôm repeating myself ‚Äî and worse than that, editing the same things over and over again in paper drafts. So I decided to document my paper writing tips. This blog post is first and foremost intended for my students, although others might find it useful too.Some of the tips here are specific to NLP papers, although many of them are general and might be useful for other fields as well. Some tips are standard practices while others are my own personal preferences. If you‚Äôre not my student, feel free to ignore those ;)As this standard keeps changing (hopefully improving!) I plan to update this blog post.Important Note: This document doesn‚Äôt replace the submission instructions for the particular venue you‚Äôre targeting. Always follow the official submission instructions and style files if there are any conflicts between them and this document.ContentDon‚Äôt forget the why. The paper needs to be clear about 1) what are the research questions it attempts to answer; and 2) why they are important. Make sure the introduction answers the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions before diving into the ‚Äúhow‚Äù questions.Go from abstract to concrete. Leave the more technical details to the method, data, and experimental setup sections. Always start with the more abstract details before diving into the specifics. A standard way to achieve this is to have a paragraph at the top of a technical section describing the subcomponents at a high level while referencing the specific subsection describing each in detail. In some cases it‚Äôs also helpful to provide a visual overview of the proposed method. See this example paragraph from Ravi et al (2023):The architecture of our method is shown in Figure 1. We use the same clustering method as in Cattan et al. (2021a) but revise the pairwise scorer. Our goal is to improve the model‚Äôs ability to resolve coreferences between mention pairs that are not lexically or contextually similar, but where one mention could be inferred from the other using commonsense knowledge and reasoning. Thus, we develop a commonsense inference engine (Sec 3.1) and use it to enhance the pairwise scorer (Sec 3.2).Write the introduction, abstract, and conclusion last. I think it‚Äôs helpful to think of the introduction as the summary of the paper and the abstract as a summary of the introduction. As such, they each need to address the following aspects: 1Ô∏è‚É£ motivation of the work, 2Ô∏è‚É£ gap from prior work, 3Ô∏è‚É£ proposed work, 4Ô∏è‚É£ findings, and 5Ô∏è‚É£ concluding sentence (typically pertaining to future work, limitations, or implications of the findings). For this reason, it‚Äôs helpful to leave the writing of this section to the end, once the ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù of the paper is clear after describing the results. Here is an example abstract from Shwartz et al. (2020), where I marked each aspect:[1Ô∏è‚É£ Natural language understanding involves reading between the lines with implicit background knowledge.] [2Ô∏è‚É£ Current systems either rely on pre-trained language models as the sole implicit source of world knowledge, or resort to external knowledge bases (KBs) to incorporate additional relevant knowledge.] [3Ô∏è‚É£ We propose an unsupervised framework based on self-talk as a novel alternative to multiple-choice commonsense tasks. Inspired by inquiry-based discovery learning (Bruner, 1961), our approach inquires language models with a number of information seeking questions such as ‚Äúwhat is the definition of‚Ä¶‚Äù to discover additional background knowledge.] [4Ô∏è‚É£ Empirical results demonstrate that the self-talk procedure substantially improves the performance of zero-shot language model baselines on four out of six commonsense benchmarks, and competes with models that obtain knowledge from external KBs.] [5Ô∏è‚É£ While our approach improves performance on several benchmarks, the self-talk induced knowledge even when leading to correct answers is not always seen as helpful by human judges, raising interesting questions about the inner-workings of pre-trained language models for commonsense reasoning.]Another way to think about it is that the abstract and the introduction are your chances to convince the reader to read the entire paper. With that said, don‚Äôt use techniques such as building suspense to attract readers. We‚Äôre not writing fiction :) Spell out the main findings early on.Less is more. You might have worked on the project for over a year. You probably implemented half a dozen solutions before finding the one that worked. In the paper, it‚Äôs important that you only describe what‚Äôs relevant, excluding some (often most) of the work you‚Äôve done. Although research tends to involve many failed attempts and detours before landing on a successful idea, academic papers are structured as if you‚Äôve had the one successful idea from the start.Getting from point A to point B might have included many detours along the way, but the paper should (typically) describe it as a straight line.On a related note, the paper doesn‚Äôt have to describe what you did chronologically, it‚Äôs more important to describe it in an order that is easy to understand.Some students think that they need to highlight many different contributions in the paper. I think it doesn‚Äôt always work in their favour. Reviewers are not impressed with more work, they want to see high quality work. Don‚Äôt dilute your high quality solution with mediocre intermediate steps. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to leave some ideas out, or to separate them to another paper.There is an important distinction I‚Äôd like to make here. It‚Äôs legitimate to experiment with different ideas and decide to leave some of them behind along the way. It‚Äôs not legitimate to pick and choose experiments to report and exclude unflattering results. For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre writing a method paper. You tested it on a few datasets where it performed well. Now you tested it on another dataset and it performs less well than the state-of-the-art or one of your baselines. You should still report the results.The paper needs to be self-contained. Remember, you‚Äôve worked on the problem for a long time and gained some knowledge that is not common knowledge in the field. Try to write the paper such that your lab mates working on different NLP tasks can easily understand it without reading prior work.LanguageKeep it simple. It is very frustrating when papers use overly complicated language. Aim to write papers that can be understood by anyone in NLP, regardless of their subarea.Don‚Äôt try to sound smart. There is no need to use ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù words like utilize instead of use. It doesn‚Äôt make you sound smarter or more academic.Be concise. One of the advantages of the page limit in conference (and some journal) papers is that it encourages conciseness. Don‚Äôt repeat your point within the same section (repeating some important points in the abstract, introduction, and the body of the paper is ok). Don‚Äôt go back and forth between topics. Don‚Äôt use vacuous words like distinct (as in ‚Äúwe evaluated our method on 5 distinct datasets‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs implied that the 5 datasets are not the same) and novel (as in ‚Äúwe‚Äôre proposing a novel method‚Äù ‚Äî of course you‚Äôre not proposing an existing method).Be clear and specific. I was going to write ‚Äúdon‚Äôt write abstract or vague sentences‚Äù, but I realize this is an abstract and vague recommendation. So instead, let me be more specific: add examples. I especially like papers that follow the same example throughout the paper. For example, in Coil and Shwartz (2023), we ran with the ‚Äúcrocodile chocolate‚Äù example from the title, through the abstract and introduction, all the way to the analysis. But different examples are also ok. Please include examples!Don‚Äôt write overly long sentences. This advice applies to any genre of writing. It‚Äôs cognitively difficult to understand long sentences. Split them into multiple short sentences.Don‚Äôt oversell. In recent years, there is a tendency to oversell papers as if each and every one of them is transformative ‚Äî while in practice there is such a constant stream of NLP papers that most papers will hardly be remembered a few years down the line. I always prefer to be honest about the contributions of the paper (I even wrote a ‚Äúlimitations‚Äù section before it was mandatory for *CL conferences!). For example, here is the end of the introduction from Waterson and Shwartz (2018):We experiment with various evaluation settings, including settingsthat make lexical memorization impossible. In these settings, the integrated method performs better than the baselines. Even so, the performance is mediocre for all methods, suggesting that the task is difficult and warrants further investigation.We could have just mentioned that we have a method that outperforms the baselines. But I think it‚Äôs important to not deceive the reader that this is a working solution that could be implemented into downstream tasks.I realize this tip is tricky because being honest about the contributions and limitations makes your paper look worse ‚Äî on the surface ‚Äî than a paper written by an enthusiastic snake oil salesperson. But I‚Äôd really like to believe that there is a non-negligible number of reviewers out there who read beyond the hype and will appreciate your integrity.Comparison to Prior WorkKnow the literature. Motivate your work in the context of prior work and existing problems. I‚Äôve heard a tip circling around that grad students should not read the literature because it would make them less creative. That is, excuse me, complete bullshit. Most of us are not creative geniuses, and if you don‚Äôt read the literature, the most likely thing that would happen is that you get to the paper writing part, do a quick Google search for the related work section, and discover that your idea has already been published before.At the same time, you don‚Äôt need to read every NLP paper as soon as it is published on arXiv. Try to dive deeply into the topic you‚Äôre currently working on and choose other influential or interesting papers in other subareas more selectively.Don‚Äôt plagiarize. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. It‚Äôs not ok to copy complete sentences from other papers. The best way to make sure you don‚Äôt plagiarize is to read the related work and summarize it in your own words (emphasizing the points more pertinent to your paper) in a document, and then consult the document when you write the related work section. Summarizing a paper right after you read it would also help you describe it in your paper in the context of your own work. I‚Äôve seen cases of vague descriptions of prior work, sometimes using completely different terminology, only to google these sentences and find they were ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from the abstract of said paper. Needless to say, don‚Äôt cite papers without reading them.The related work section is not a shopping list. Don‚Äôt just list papers that are related to yours. Try to group them according to their themes, draw conclusions, and use them to emphasize the gap in the literature that your work aims to address. For example, Qin et al. (2020) describe the related work along 3 dimensions, each paragraph ending with the differences from the current paper.Be critical. Don‚Äôt assume that anything written in previous work is gold. Yes, even if these are peer reviewed papers. If you doubt some claim written in previous work, you may be right about it. Test it carefully and challenge it if you find it to be wrong.StyleOk, now we‚Äôre getting into the nit-picky zone!Don‚Äôt over-capitalize. It‚Äôs not Large Language Models, it‚Äôs large language models.Don‚Äôt define basic terms. E.g. there is definitely no need to define NLP as ‚Äúnatural language processing‚Äù in an NLP paper.Quotation marks in LaTex are different. Opening quotation is `` and closing quotation is ‚Äô‚Äô. If you copy from a Google doc or some other document, make sure to replace the quotes. (For single quotes use ` and ‚Äò).Use booktabs for tables. Judge for yourself which one looks better:regular vs booktabs table, from Better LaTeX Tables with BooktabsCitationsUse the ACL anthology. Most papers published in NLP venues are available in the ACL anthology. The conference style files typically include an anthology.bib file that includes all the bibtex entries for these papers (downloadable from here), as well as a custom.bib file for other citations. When you want to cite a paper, check if it exists on the ACL anthology. If it does, click on ‚Äúcite‚Äù to see the bibtex key. For example:If it‚Äôs not in the ACL anthology, find the bibtex from the other venue (or Google Scholar / Semantic Scholar) and put it in the custom.bib file.Cite the correct version of the paper. Google Scholar often defaults to the arXiv version, but you should check if the paper has since been accepted at another venue (journal or conference), and cite that version instead.Use the correct citation format. \citep is intended for parenthetical citations, as in ‚ÄúWe extracted short narratives from the Toronto Book corpus (Zhu et al., 2015)‚Äù. \citet (or \newcite in the *CL style files) is used for citations within the text, as in ‚ÄúYu and Ettinger (2020) showed that LMs encode the words that appear in a given text, but capture little information regarding phrase meaning‚Äù.WritingNLPAcademic WritingAcademic Research----8FollowWritten by Vered Shwartz270 Followers¬∑26 FollowingAssistant professor of computer science at UBCFollowResponses (8)See all responsesHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams

How many of the luminous dots that we see naked are galaxies and not stars from our galaxy?
I imagine that the majority of the luminous points that we see naked eye during the night, are actually stars from our galaxy. But how many of them are other objects (other galaxies, nebula, etc.), excluding planets from our Solar System?

Ok, Il'll try there. I thought it was inactive, since it is beta and has only 317 questions. I also read on area51 that the previous astronomy Q&A site had been closed and that astronomy questions had been merged into this site.

By the way, for clarity's sake, we are not an inactive site per se. We have slowed down substantially, but we are in that developmental phase that many beta sites experience where the initial activity has slowed and we are in need of people like you to come and ask great questions!

In the best sky conditions, the naked eye (with effort) can see objects with an apparent magnitude of 8.0. This reveals about 43,197 objects in the sky.
There are 9 galaxies visible to the naked eye that you might see when observing the sky, and there are about 13 nebulae that you might see.

Under typical dark sky conditions, the limit is about 6.0. 8.0 would require extraordinary conditions (and much better eyes than mine). The only galaxies visible to the naked eye in normal conditions (outside our own) are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, M31 (Andromeda), and M33 (Triangulum). There are only sporadic reports of other galaxies being seen by the naked eye. (There's some argument that Omega Centauri is a galaxy rather than a globular cluster.)

@KeithThompson Right, there's more on that in my linked sources. The OP asked ""how many"" which is a question which often looks for the maximum extent. So I answered with the most possible that could be viewed.

I would like to add the obvious that most of the stars we see are bright luminous stars and in no way represents the majority of stars in the galaxy or even the nearby solar neighborhood.

On a visit to Yosemite in May of 1975 or 1976, I saw a very clear, very dark and moonless night sky that was studded with stars. I gazed at the sky for a long time because it was so beautiful, and in that sky I also saw galaxies. I don't remember exactly how many galaxies, but there were multiple galaxies. As I gazed at it, I thought to myself that I would probably never again see such a sky (I was right) and that for the rest of my life I would doubt that I had seen such a sky (I was right). I kept gazing at it, to fix it as much as possible in my memory. Still, the memory is elusive. My sense is that there might have been twenty or more galaxies in that sky. Would twenty or more galaxies visible to the unaided eye have been possible forty-five years ago? Elevation about 3500 feet, clear dark night, 1975-6.

$\begingroup$
Actually, elevation can be a disadvantage, though 3500 feet is probably ok. The reason is that diminished oxygen results in poorer visual acuity. In fact 3500 feet is probably ideal because you are above any surface dust layer but not so high that there is much of a decrease in oxygen.

$\begingroup$
I'm sorry to tell you that you probably did not see any galaxies at all. There are only a few that can ever be seen with the naked eye. The two easiest (the Magellanic clouds) can never be seen from Yosemite's latitude, and the next two (M31 & M33) aren't up that time of year. Any others are extremely dim. I suspect you probably saw a number of open clusters or other groupings of stars, not galaxies.

Integers have unique prime factorizations
This article is about the unique factorization of integers into prime numbers. For the theorem about roots of a polynomial, see Fundamental theorem of algebra. For other fundamental theorems, see List of theorems called fundamental.
In Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) Gauss proved the unique factorization theorem [1] and used it to prove the law of quadratic reciprocity.[2]
In mathematics, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also called the unique factorization theorem and prime factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.[3][4][5] For example,





1200
=

2

4


‚ãÖ

{\displaystyle 1200=2^{4}\cdot 3^{1}\cdot 5^{2}=(2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2)\cdot 3\cdot (5\cdot 5)=5\cdot 2\cdot 5\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 2=\ldots }


The theorem says two things about this example: first, that 1200 can be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no other primes in the product.
The requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing composite numbers may not be unique 
(for example, 



12
=
2
‚ãÖ
6
=
3
‚ãÖ
4


{\displaystyle 12=2\cdot 6=3\cdot 4}

).
This theorem is one of the main reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number: if 1 were prime, then factorization into primes would not be unique; for example, 



2
=
2
‚ãÖ
1
=
2
‚ãÖ
1
‚ãÖ
1
=
‚Ä¶


{\displaystyle 2=2\cdot 1=2\cdot 1\cdot 1=\ldots }


The theorem generalizes to other algebraic structures that are called unique factorization domains and include principal ideal domains, Euclidean domains, and polynomial rings over a field. However, the theorem does not hold for algebraic integers.[6] This failure of unique factorization is one of the reasons for the difficulty of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The implicit use of unique factorization in rings of algebraic integers is behind the error of many of the numerous false proofs that have been written during the 358 years between Fermat's statement and Wiles's proof.


History[edit]
The fundamental theorem can be derived from Book VII, propositions 30, 31 and 32, and Book IX, proposition 14 of Euclid's Elements.


If two numbers by multiplying one another make some
number, and any prime number measure the product, it will
also measure one of the original numbers.

‚Äî‚ÄäEuclid, Elements Book VII, Proposition 30
(In modern terminology: if a  prime p divides the product ab, then p divides either a or b or both.) Proposition 30 is referred to as Euclid's lemma, and it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.


Any composite number is measured by some prime number.

‚Äî‚ÄäEuclid, Elements Book VII, Proposition 31
(In modern terminology: every integer greater than one is divided evenly by some prime number.) Proposition 31 is proved directly by infinite descent.


Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number.

‚Äî‚ÄäEuclid, Elements Book VII, Proposition 32
Proposition 32 is derived from proposition 31, and proves that the decomposition is possible.


If a number be the least that is measured by prime numbers, it will not be measured by any
other prime number except those originally measuring it.

‚Äî‚ÄäEuclid, Elements Book IX, Proposition 14
(In modern terminology: a least common multiple of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number.) Book IX, proposition 14 is derived from Book VII, proposition 30, and proves partially that the decomposition is unique ‚Äì a point critically noted by Andr√© Weil.[7] Indeed, in this proposition the exponents are all equal to one, so nothing is said for the general case.
While Euclid took the first step on the way to the existence of prime factorization, KamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-FƒÅrisƒ´ took the final step[8] and stated for the first time the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.[9]
Article 16 of Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is an early modern statement and proof employing modular arithmetic.[1]

Applications[edit]
Canonical representation of a positive integer[edit]
Every positive integer n > 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers





n

,


{\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{n_{1}}p_{2}^{n_{2}}\cdots p_{k}^{n_{k}}=\prod _{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{n_{i}},}


where p1 < p2 < ... < pk are primes and the ni are positive integers. This representation is commonly extended to all positive integers, including 1, by the convention that the empty product is equal to 1 (the empty product corresponds to k = 0).
This representation is called the canonical representation[10] of n, or the standard form[11][12] of n.  For example,

999 = 33√ó37,
1000 = 23√ó53,
1001 = 7√ó11√ó13.
Factors p0 = 1 may be inserted without changing the value of n (for example, 1000 = 23√ó30√ó53).  In fact, any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an infinite product taken over all the positive prime numbers, as

where a finite number of the ni are positive integers, and the others are zero. 
Allowing negative exponents provides a canonical form for positive rational numbers.

Arithmetic operations[edit]
The canonical representations of the product, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers a and b can be expressed simply in terms of the canonical representations of a and b themselves:

However, integer factorization, especially of large numbers, is much more difficult than computing products, GCDs, or LCMs.  So these formulas have limited use in practice.

Arithmetic functions[edit]
Main article: Arithmetic function
Many arithmetic functions are defined using the canonical representation. In particular, the values of additive and multiplicative functions are determined by their values on the powers of prime numbers.

Proof[edit]
The proof uses Euclid's lemma (Elements VII, 30): If a prime divides the product of two integers, then it must divide at least one of these integers.

Existence[edit]
It must be shown that every integer greater than 1 is either prime or a product of primes.  First, 2 is prime.  Then, by strong induction, assume this is true for all numbers greater than 1 and less than n. If n is prime, there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, there are integers a and b,  where n = a b, and 1 < a ‚â§ b < n.  By the induction hypothesis, a = p1 p2 ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ pj and b = q1 q2 ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ qk are products of primes. But then n = a b = p1 p2 ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ pj q1 q2 ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ qk is a product of primes.

Uniqueness[edit]
Suppose, to the contrary, there is an integer that has two distinct prime factorizations. Let n be the least such integer and write n = p1 p2 ... pj = q1 q2 ... qk, where each pi and qi is prime. We see that p1 divides q1 q2 ... qk, so p1 divides some qi by Euclid's lemma. Without loss of generality, say p1 divides q1. Since p1 and q1 are both prime, it follows that p1 = q1. Returning to our factorizations of n, we may cancel these two factors to conclude that p2 ... pj = q2 ... qk. We now have two distinct prime factorizations of some integer strictly smaller than n, which contradicts the minimality of n.

Uniqueness without Euclid's lemma[edit]
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid's lemma.[13] The proof that follows is inspired by Euclid's original version of the Euclidean algorithm. 
Assume that 



s


{\displaystyle s}

 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. Incidentally, this implies that 



s


{\displaystyle s}

, if it exists, must be a composite number greater than 



1


{\displaystyle 1}

. Now, say 









s



=

p

1



p

2


‚ãØ

p

q

2


‚ãØ

q

n


.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s&=p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{m}\\&=q_{1}q_{2}\cdots q_{n}.\end{aligned}}}


Every 




p

i




{\displaystyle p_{i}}

 must be distinct from every 




q

j


.


{\displaystyle q_{j}.}

 Otherwise, if say 




p

i


=

q

j


,


{\displaystyle p_{i}=q_{j},}

 then there would exist some positive integer 



t
=
s

/


p

i


=
s

/


q

j




{\displaystyle t=s/p_{i}=s/q_{j}}

 that is smaller than s and has two distinct prime factorizations. One may also suppose that 




p

1


<

q

1


,


{\displaystyle p_{1}<q_{1},}

 by exchanging the two factorizations, if needed.
Setting 



P
=

p

2


‚ãØ

p

m




{\displaystyle P=p_{2}\cdots p_{m}}

 and 



Q
=

q

2


‚ãØ

q

n


,


{\displaystyle Q=q_{2}\cdots q_{n},}

 one has 



s
=

p

1


P
=

q

1


Q
.


{\displaystyle s=p_{1}P=q_{1}Q.}


Also, since 




p

1


<

q

1


,


{\displaystyle p_{1}<q_{1},}

 one has 



Q
<
P
.


{\displaystyle Q<P.}


It then follows that





s
‚àí

p

1


Q
=
(

q

1


‚àí

p

1


)
Q
=

p

1


(
P
‚àí
Q
)
<
s
.


{\displaystyle s-p_{1}Q=(q_{1}-p_{1})Q=p_{1}(P-Q)<s.}


As the positive integers less than s have been supposed to have a unique prime factorization, 




p

1




{\displaystyle p_{1}}

 must occur in the factorization of either 




q

1


‚àí

p

1




{\displaystyle q_{1}-p_{1}}

 or Q. The latter case is impossible, as Q, being smaller than s, must have a unique prime factorization, and 




p

1




{\displaystyle p_{1}}

 differs from every 




q

j


.


{\displaystyle q_{j}.}

 The former case is also impossible, as, if 




p

1




{\displaystyle p_{1}}

 is a divisor of 




q

1


‚àí

p

1


,


{\displaystyle q_{1}-p_{1},}

 it must be also a divisor of 




q

1


,


{\displaystyle q_{1},}

 which is impossible as 




p

1




{\displaystyle p_{1}}

 and 




q

1




{\displaystyle q_{1}}

 are distinct primes.
Therefore, there cannot exist a smallest integer with more than a single distinct prime factorization. Every positive integer must either be a prime number itself, which would factor uniquely, or a composite that also factors uniquely into primes, or in the case of the integer 



1


{\displaystyle 1}

, not factor into any prime.

Generalizations[edit]

The first generalization of the theorem is found in Gauss's second monograph (1832) on biquadratic reciprocity. This paper introduced what is now called the ring of Gaussian integers, the set of all complex numbers a + bi where a and b are integers. It is now denoted by 




Z

[
i
]
.


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [i].}

 He showed that this ring has the four units ¬±1 and ¬±i, that the non-zero, non-unit numbers fall into two classes, primes and composites, and that (except for order), the composites have unique factorization as a product of primes (up to the order and multiplication by units).[14]
Similarly, in 1844 while working on cubic reciprocity, Eisenstein introduced the ring 




Z

{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [\omega ]}

, where 



œâ

{\textstyle \omega ={\frac {-1+{\sqrt {-3}}}{2}},}

 ¬† 




œâ

{\displaystyle \omega ^{3}=1}

 is a cube root of unity. This is the ring of Eisenstein integers, and he proved it has the six units 



¬±

{\displaystyle \pm 1,\pm \omega ,\pm \omega ^{2}}

 and that it has unique factorization.
However, it was also discovered that unique factorization does not always hold. An example is given by 




Z

[

]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {-5}}]}

. In this ring one has[15]

{\displaystyle 6=2\cdot 3=\left(1+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(1-{\sqrt {-5}}\right).}


Examples like this caused the notion of ""prime"" to be modified. In 




Z


[


‚àí
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, for example, 2 = ab, then one of a or b must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of ""prime"". It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid's lemma; for example, 2 divides neither (1 + ‚àö‚àí5) nor (1 ‚àí ‚àö‚àí5) even though it divides their product 6. In algebraic number theory 2 is called irreducible in 




Z


[


‚àí
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not prime in 




Z


[


‚àí
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of 




Z


[


‚àí
5


]



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \left[{\sqrt {-5}}\right]}

 is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in 




Z

.


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} .}

 Using these definitions it can be proven that in any integral domain a prime must be irreducible. Euclid's classical lemma can be rephrased as ""in the ring of integers 




Z



{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }

 every irreducible is prime"". This is also true in 




Z

[
i
]


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [i]}

 and 




Z

,


{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [\omega ],}

 but not in

{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {-5}}].}


The rings in which factorization into irreducibles is essentially unique are called unique factorization domains. Important examples are polynomial rings over the integers or over a field, Euclidean domains and principal ideal domains.
In 1843 Kummer introduced the concept of ideal number, which was developed further by Dedekind (1876) into the modern theory of ideals, special subsets of rings. Multiplication is defined for ideals, and the rings in which they have unique factorization are called Dedekind domains.
There is a version of unique factorization for ordinals, though it requires some additional conditions to ensure uniqueness.
Any commutative M√∂bius monoid satisfies a unique factorization theorem and thus possesses arithmetical properties similar to those of the multiplicative semigroup of positive integers. Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is, in fact, a special case of the unique factorization theorem in commutative M√∂bius monoids.

					I have been designing a single pass sieve tray. Whilst the calculations I have for a 4 meter diameter tray is theoretically sound, reading around literature made me think that since it is a large diamter column I should be employing two-pass trays. 

However my search for books which discusses multipass trays in detail has been to no avail. I would like to have a solid basis to justify a two-pass design, however it seems that most books quote it as ""according to previous experiences"". Should I just stick with a one-pass design for academic purposes? 

Thanks!

					Multi-pass trays do work in reality. I have seen those in conventional distillation towers (e.g. Atmospheric Distillation Unit in refinery, 2- to 4-pass trays) and also in some amine absorbers (although they call for special care during design because of amine residence time issues), and also in gas condensate strippers (the one here has 6-pass trays).

Normally, we employ multi-pass trays when handling extremely large liquid flows. Having single-pass trays would result in somewhat unacceptable big tower diameter, and opting for multi-pass trays is one fancy way of solving the problem.

You can try to compare two different designs (i.e. single- and multi-pass trays) for the same system by using vendor software such is KG Tower from Koch-Glitsch. It is available at: http://www.koch-glit...re/default.aspx

Cheers,

					In order to decide between single pass cross flow plates and multi-pass plates you need to consider the hydraulic gradient.  There is a resistance to the liquid flowing across the plate due to the rising vapor bubbles, and the valves (if a valve tray).  This effect was far worse in the days of bubble cap trays as the liquid had to flow around and between the caps.The hydraulic gradient means that the liquid is deeper on the inlet side of the tray than near the overflow weir.  Because the vapor pressure drop over the tray has to be the same on the side with deeper liquid as it is where the liquid is shallow, you get less vapor flow through the deep liquid.  This results in maldistribution of the vapor, causing decreases in efficiency and capacity.The answer is to use shorter flow paths, as with multi-pass trays.  For more detail see Perry or Kister.

					Katmar is right. By using multi-pass trays you'll definitely loose some efficiency as compared to a single-pass tower. I remember when I was doing efficiency calculations for condensate stripper (dryer) where two-pass design was calling for approx. 15% more theoretical stages required for the same product specs. Or, in other way, by saving money on tower diameter you'll have to spend additional resources on a little bit extra height.

					LeeFauxe,

The number of passes in a distillation column is really a function of vapor-liquid loadings only. I have seen one pass, two pass as well as four pass trays being used in same service in different plant. Usually if the weir loading (volumetric flow of liquid/length of outlet weir) is more than 6 GPM/in, the number of passes is increased. Really speaking there is no basis of this 6 GPM/in. I know of a column with as high as ~9 GPM/in weir loading, but still operates well.

As Zauberberg has rightly pointed out, be careful about the efficiency. As you increase the number of passes, the tray efficiency comes down.

Hope this helps,
Abhishek

					There is an excellent discussion on the design and operation of multi-pass trays the the following article :-

http://kolmetz.com/p...gn AIChE R5.pdf

This highlights the fact that it is very difficult to design a multi-pass tray with all the V/L ratios the same in the different sections on the tray.  If the weir overflow rates are not all the same (i.e. GPM/inch) there will be varying liquid depths, and this results in the same maldistribution that I mentioned earlier as being caused by the liquid gradient in large single pass trays.  I guess the simulator that Zauberberg used made an allowance for this balancing difficulty and lowered the estimated tray efficiency, resulting in the additional 15% trays.

					thank you so much guys. Ive had a look at my stripper section and the liquid loading is at the limit. This would be very helpful in sorting out a discussion and possibly an alternative tray design for my project. Thank you so much!

Twitter, Inc. was an American social media company based in San Francisco, California, which operated and was named for its flagship social media network prior to its rebrand as X. In addition to Twitter, the company previously operated the Vine short video app and Periscope livestreaming service. In April 2023, Twitter merged with X Holdings[6] and ceased to be an independent company, becoming a part of X Corp.[7]
Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and was launched that July. By 2012[update], more than 100 million users tweeted 340 million tweets a day.[8][9] The company went public in November 2013. By 2019[update], Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[10]
On April 25, 2022, Twitter agreed to a $44 billion buyout by Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, one of the biggest deals to turn a company private.[11][12] On July 8, Musk terminated the deal.[13] Twitter's shares fell,[14] leading company officials to sue Musk in Delaware's Court of Chancery on July 12.[15] On October 4, Musk announced his intention to purchase the company as he had agreed, for $44 billion, or $54.20 a share;[16] the agreement closed on October 27. By October, 2024, X was worth less than 80% of what it was acquired for, and its value in 2025 was estimated to be around $9 billion. The platform's ad revenue has declined significantly.
Following Musk's takeover, Twitter was criticized for an increase in hate speech,[17] as well as for systemic prioritization of right-wing content.[18][19][20] His acquisition of the company has been characterized by large-scale policy changes, mass layoffs and resignations, and a dramatic shift in the company's work culture.


History[edit]
Main article: History of Twitter
2006‚Äì2007: Creation and initial reaction[edit]
A sketch, c. 2006, by Jack Dorsey, envisioning an SMS-based social network
Twitter's origins lie in a ""daylong brainstorming session"" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[21][22] Work on the project started in February 2006.[23] Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50¬†p.m. PST (UTC‚àí08:00): ""just setting up my twttr"".[1] The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees.[23] The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.[4] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets‚Äîincluding Odeo.com and Twitter.com‚Äîfrom the investors and shareholders.[24] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.[25] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.[26]
The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[27] ""The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,"" remarked Newsweek's Steven Levy. ""Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.""[28] Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was ""absolutely ruling"" SXSWi. Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was ""owning"" the conference.[29]

2007‚Äì2022: Growth[edit]
In April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit, with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies.[30] Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin.[31] Twitter hit 100¬†million monthly active users in September 2011. On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200¬†million monthly active users.[32]
The company had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on November 7, 2013.[33]
In September 2016, Twitter shares rose 20% after a report that it had received takeover approaches.[34] Potential buyers were Alphabet (the parent company of Google),[34] Microsoft,[35][36][37] Salesforce.com,[34][38] Verizon,[38] and The Walt Disney Company.[39][40] Twitter's board of directors were open to a deal, which could have come by the end of 2016.[34][41] However, no deal was made, with reports in October stating that all the potential buyers dropped out partly due to concerns over abuse and harassment on the service.[42][43][44] In June 2017, Twitter revamped its dashboard to improve the new user experience.[45][46]
In April 2021, Twitter announced that it was establishing its African headquarters in Ghana.[47][48]
In January 2022, Twitter finalized the sale of MoPub to AppLovin. The deal was first announced in October 2021, and the selling price was reported at $1.05 billion.[49]

2022 and 2023[edit]
Acquisition by Elon Musk[edit]
Main article: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk
Business magnate Elon Musk revealed that he had bought 9.1% of Twitter for $2.64 billion on April 4, 2022.[50][51][52] In response, Twitter's stock rose by as much as 27% and Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday surge since Twitter's IPO in 2013.[53] Musk was appointed to Twitter's board on April 9, under a deal that prohibited him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[51][54][55]
Musk made an unsolicited offer on April 14 to acquire Twitter for $44 billion and take the company private.[56] Publicly, Musk expressed that his offer was motivated by concerns with how the company was managed, emphasizing his concern that policies he described as censorship were leading to a lack of free speech on the platform.[57][58] Twitter's board introduced a ""poison pill"" strategy on April 15, which would allow shareholders to buy additional stock should a hostile takeover occur as a means to block Musk's takeover.[59] On April 20, Musk secured $46.5 billion in funding as a tender offer, which the board accepted on April 25.[60][61][62]
On July 8, Musk announced he was unilaterally terminating the proposed acquisition, claiming in a regulatory filing that Twitter was in ""material breach"" of several parts of the agreement by refusing to comply with Musk's requests for spambot account data and dismissing high-ranking employees.[63][64] In response, Twitter board chair Bret Taylor pledged to pursue legal action against Musk at the Delaware Court of Chancery with the goal of completing the acquisition.[65][66] On July 12, Twitter opened a lawsuit against Musk to force the sale to proceed.[67] On September 13, 2022, Twitter shareholders voted to approve Elon Musk's takeover of the company.[68]
On October 4, 2022, it was reported that Musk offered to proceed with the deal at the original offer price of $54.20 per share.[69][70] The deal closed on October 27, 2022, with the merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I, Inc., wholly owned by Musk,[71] and Musk took control of the company,[72] paying $54.20 per share, or about $44 billion.[73]
By January 2023, Twitter only had around 2,300 employees left, according to Musk, with only 550 working full-time.[74][75][76][77] By April, there were less than 1,500 active employees left[78] with 80% of Twitter's work force gone within a year.[79]

Post-acquisition[edit]
On October 28, immediately following Musk's acquisition, he fired CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal.[80] Twitter's stock was suspended from trading prior to the New York Stock Exchange opening the next day and was delisted on November 8.[81][82] On October 31, Musk announced in a security filing that he had dissolved the board of directors and would serve as the CEO of the company.[83] In January 2023, he also fired an employee who criticized him.[84]
On November 4, Twitter laid off about half of its 7,500 employees,[85] leaving several internal departments, including communication and core engineering teams, understaffed.[86] Some of the employees were later asked to return, with Twitter stating that they were ""laid off by mistake"".[87] Several current and former Twitter employees sued the company for violations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 due to failures to provide a 60-day notice prior to mass firings.[88][89]
Top security, compliance, content moderation, and sales executives resigned due to Musk stating that employees must either work longer hours or resign from the company.[90] On November 16, Musk issued an ""ultimatum"" to all remaining Twitter employees warning that workers could expect ""long, intense hours of work"" if they decided to stay, a decision that was ordered to be made by the following day, with news sources reporting numerous employees leaving on the same day.[91][92][93] The Verge reported that multiple critical engineering teams ""completely or near-total[ly] resigned"", increasing internal fears of a collapse of Twitter.[94]
Within a week of Musk's acquisition and subsequent internal instability of the firm, including layoffs of Twitter's trust and safety teams, large advertisers including General Mills, Pfizer, Volkswagen, and General Motors announced an advertising pause.[95] Advertising agencies, including IPG and Omnicom Media Group, advised clients to pause ad spending on Twitter temporarily until the platform can sufficiently assure brand safety concerns.[96] Apprehension over increased hate speech made advertisers leave in large numbers. Impersonator accounts had increased following errors in the blue tick scheme for verified users causing concerns.[97] Musk said Twitter was experiencing ""a massive drop in revenue"" causing losses of $4 million per day, which he attributed to ""activist groups pressuring advertisers,"" adding that ""nothing is working"" to lure advertisers back.[98]
According to a November 2022 report from Media Matters for America, Twitter had lost half of its top 100 advertisers, which spent $750 million on ads in 2022.[99] Advertising research firm Standard Media Index said advertiser spending on Twitter declined 55% in November year-on-year, and declined 71% in December, despite those holiday months typically seeing higher ad spending.[100]
By December 2022, Musk's family office privately sought to sell new shares valued at his original acquisition price of $54.20, amid turmoil among users and advertisers, and debt payments approaching. Musk's money manager wrote to investors that in recent weeks the family office had received ""numerous inbound requests to invest in Twitter.""[101][102] The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2023 that talks had been held to raise up to $3 billion to pay down some of the $13 billion in bank debt incurred in the deal, which includes a $3 billion high interest rate bridge loan. Musk denied the report, saying, ""corpo media shills clearly have their marching orders to write hit pieces on me these days.""[103][104] The Journal reported in October 2023 that the seven major banks that provided the $13 billion loan had been unable to follow the standard practice of quickly selling down their exposure to other banks, due to a lack of appetite for the debt since Musk took over. The banks expected to mark down the debt by at least 15% in order to sell it.[105][needs update]
In April 2023, Twitter, now under the ownership of Musk, designated National Public Radio as ""US state-affiliated media"",[106][107] a label ""that's typically been reserved for foreign media outlets that represent the official views of the government, like Russia's RT and China's Xinhua.""[108][109][110] This move by Twitter sparked a controversy and accusations of pro-Republican bias.[111][112][113] In a statement to Variety, NPR president and CEO John Lansing condemned the decision.[114]
Twitter, Inc. was merged with X Corp. in April 2023.[115][116]

Services[edit]
Twitter[edit]
Main article: Twitter
Twitter was an American social networking service that was rebranded as X in 2023. Users could share concise text messages, images, and videos through ""tweets"" and engage with other users' content via likes or ""retweets"".[117]

Vine[edit]
Main article: Vine (service)
On October 5, 2012, Twitter acquired a video clip company called Vine that launched in January 2013.[118][119] Twitter released Vine as a standalone app that allows users to create and share six-second looping video clips on January 24, 2013. Vine videos shared on Twitter are visible directly in users' Twitter feeds.[120] On October 27, 2016, Twitter announced that it would disable all uploads, but that viewing and download would continue to work.[121][122] On January 20, 2017, Twitter launched an Internet archive of all Vine videos that had ever been published. The archive was officially discontinued in April 2019.[123]

Main article: Crashlytics
Twitter acquired Crashlytics, a crash reporting tool for developers, on January 28, 2013, for over US$100¬†million, its largest acquisition at the time.[128] Twitter committed to continue supporting and expanding the service.[129]
In October 2014, Twitter announced Fabric, a suite of mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics.[130] Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular SDK, allowing developers to pick and choose which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By building Fabric on top of Crashlytics, Twitter was able to take advantage of Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1¬†billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.[131]
In early 2016, Twitter announced that Fabric was installed on more than 2 billion active devices and used by more than 225,000 developers. Fabric is recognized as the #1 most popular crash reporting and also the #1 mobile analytics solution among the top 200 iOS apps, beating out Google Analytics, Flurry, and Mixpanel.[132][133] In January 2017, Google acquired Fabric from Twitter and later integrated it into their Firebase platform.[134][135]

Revue[edit]
Revue was a service which lets writers create email newsletters and offer free or paid subscriptions to them. Revue was founded in the Netherlands in 2015 and acquired by Twitter on January 26, 2021.[136] On December 14, 2022, Twitter announced the service would be discontinued on January 18, 2023, at which point all user data would be deleted.[137]

In November and December 2021, Twitter acquired and immediately shut down two competitors: threader.app, a service to transform Twitter threads into accessible web pages, and Quill, a messaging service.[155] Threader.app users were directed to instead purchase the Twitter Blue service, which at the time was available only in some countries.[156]

Leadership[edit]
Jack Dorsey, co-founder and then CEO of Twitter, in 2009As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[157] On October 16, 2008,[158] Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board.[159] On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Dick Costolo, formerly Twitter's chief operating officer, became CEO. On October 4, 2010, Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and ""be completely focused on product strategy"".[160][161]
According to The New York Times, ""Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship"" when Williams was away.[162] According to PC Magazine, Williams was ""no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company"". He was focused on developing a new startup, and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to ""help in any way [he could].""[163] Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time, he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.[162]
In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's board of directors.[164] In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development.[165] Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company's CFO in July 2014, with an ""annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $61.5 million"".[166] On June 10, 2015, Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1, 2015.[167] Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo.[168] On October 14, 2015, former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman, replacing Dorsey who remains CEO.[169] On January 26, 2016, Leslie Berland, former executive vice president of global advertising, marketing, and digital partnerships at American Express, was named chief marketing officer.[170] In November 2016, COO Adam Bain announced his resignation and CFO Anthony Noto took over Bain's role.[171][172] A month later, on December 20, 2016, CTO Adam Messinger announced that he too was leaving.[173][174]
In February 2020, it was reported that Elliott Management Corporation had acquired a stake in Twitter, with activist shareholder and Republican Party supporter Paul Singer expected to seek the removal of Dorsey as CEO.[175] Twitter agreed to appoint a new independent director and two new board members, and to perform $2¬†billion in share buybacks.[176]
On November 29, 2021, Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO. He was replaced by CTO Parag Agrawal.[177][178] On October 27, 2022, Elon Musk closed a deal to purchase the company and fired Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde, and general counsel Sean Edgett.[73] Musk replaced the prior board as the sole director of Twitter and appointed himself as the CEO.[83]

Funding[edit]
Twitter raised over US$57¬†million from venture capitalist growth funding, although exact figures are not publicly disclosed. Twitter's first A round of funding was for an undisclosed amount that is rumored to have been between US$1¬†million and US$5¬†million.[189] Its second B round of funding in 2008 was for US$22¬†million[190] and its third C round of funding in 2009 was for US$35¬†million from Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital along with an undisclosed amount from other investors including Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, and Insight Venture Partners.[189] Twitter is backed by Union Square Ventures, Digital Garage, Spark Capital, and Bezos Expeditions.[157]
The company raised US$200¬†million in new venture capital in December 2010, at a valuation of approximately US$3.7¬†billion.[191] In August 2010 Twitter announced a ""significant"" investment led by Digital Sky Technologies that, at US$800¬†million, was reported to be the largest venture round in history.[192] In December 2011, the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal invested US$300¬†million in Twitter. The company was valued at US$8.4¬†billion at the time.[193]

Stock launch and tax issues[edit]
On September 12, 2013, Twitter announced that it had filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ahead of a planned stock market listing.[194] It revealed its prospectus in an 800-page filing.[195] Twitter planned to raise US$1 billion as the basis for its stock market debut.[196] The initial public offering (IPO) filing states that ""200,000,000+ monthly active users"" access Twitter and ""500,000,000+ tweets per day"" are posted.[197][198] In an October 15, 2013, amendment to their SEC S-1 filing,[199] Twitter declared that they would list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), quashing speculation that their stock would trade on the NASDAQ exchange. This decision was widely viewed to be a reaction to the botched initial public offering of Facebook.[200] On November 6, 2013, 70¬†million shares[201] were priced at US$26 and issued by lead underwriter Goldman Sachs.[202]
On November 7, 2013, the first day of trading on the NYSE, Twitter shares opened at $26.00 and closed at US$44.90, giving the company a valuation of around US$31¬†billion.[203] Consequently, executives and early investors marginally increased their capital, including co-founders Williams and Dorsey who received a sum of US$2.56¬†billion and US$1.05¬†billion respectively, while Costolo's payment was US$345¬†million.[204] On February 5, 2014, Twitter published its first results as a public company, showing a net loss of $511¬†million in the fourth quarter of 2013.[205]
In November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Twitter is among the corporations that avoided paying taxes by using offshore companies.[206] Later The New York Times reported that Russian-American billionaire Yuri Milner had strong Kremlin backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.[207]

Seven banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Barclays lent Musk around $13 billion to buy Twitter a year ago this coming Friday. Under normal circumstances, they would have unloaded the debt to Wall Street investment firms soon thereafter. But investor appetite for Twitter, which Musk has since renamed X, has cooled since the billionaire took over, forcing the banks to hold the debt on their own balance sheets at a discounted value. The banks currently expect to take a hit of at least 15%, or roughly $2 billion, when they sell the debt, people familiar with the matter said.

 There‚Äôs just something about cake that brings out your inner child and makes you grin from ear to ear. Yeah, you know what I‚Äôm talking about! But the common question seems to be: do you prefer chocolate or vanilla? And I say, ‚ÄúNEITHER. I‚Äôm a CAKE POP kind of gal!‚Äù¬†


 If you‚Äôve had cake pops before, then you know why they‚Äôre a tried-and-true favorite. Once you‚Äôve tried them, you‚Äôll see why these little gems of joy need to be at every celebratory occasion under the sun! I‚Äôm going to walk you through making them step-by-step.


 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash

  What Are Cake Pops?  
 Cake pops are a soft and sweet mixture of crumbled cake and frosting. You roll that mixture into a ball, then dip it in chocolate and add sprinkles!¬†


 You‚Äôre probably wondering why you‚Äôd go to so much effort to make them when you could just bake a cake and still have the same ingredients, but I‚Äôm here to tell you that something magical happens in the process of actually incorporating the frosting INTO the cake.¬†


 It changes the texture and becomes ultra-fudgy and dense. Once the pops are dipped in chocolate, it truly is a treat to sink your teeth into! The crack of the chocolate followed by the chewiness of the cake pop is an experience you won‚Äôt forget.


  Box Mix + Homemade Frosting: A Winning Combo  
 I have been making cake pops for over 12 years and have found that using a boxed cake mix and homemade frosting is the best combination. When I first started out, I used canned frosting, and didn‚Äôt like the way it incorporated with the cake. It was too mushy, and that‚Äôs not what we want!¬†


 If I‚Äôm feeling extremely ambitious, I‚Äôll make both the cake and the frosting from scratch. If I‚Äôm short on time, I‚Äôll turn to the boxed cake mix. I promise your cake pops will turn out beautiful either way, but I will ALWAYS take the extra few minutes to make frosting from scratch. It truly can‚Äôt be beat.¬†


Simple Tip!
Make accidents into cake pops! There have been times when I‚Äôve made cupcakes that have come out extremely misshapen or baked a cake that cracked, but instead of feeling discouraged, I simply use them to make cake pops.
 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash

  Cake Pop Filling  
 The frosting really is the glue that‚Äôs holding the cake together, so you want a good-quality frosting.¬†


 When adding frosting to the cake pop filling, less is more. There have been times when I‚Äôve added too much frosting and they stick to my hands when rolling the pops out, and then they‚Äôre too soft to dip in chocolate.¬†


 Start with 1/4 cup of frosting, and then mix it into the crumbled cake in 1/4-cup increments. I‚Äôve never had to use more than 1 cup, which means you‚Äôll have leftover frosting!¬†Put it in the fridge for your next cake pop adventure or use it on cookies or cupcakes. Or simply grab a spoon and dig in after you‚Äôve had a really stressful day. I promise I won‚Äôt tell anyone.¬†


 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash

  Add a Splash of Color With Gel Food Coloring  
 If you‚Äôd like to color the frosting or the cake, I recommend using gel food coloring. Wilton is my go-to brand because I can find it almost anywhere! Insert a clean toothpick into the coloring and then drag it through the cake batter or frosting. If you need more coloring, repeat the process, but use a clean toothpick each time!


 Just a little PSA: using liquid food coloring may change the consistency of the frosting, so stick with gel!


  Mix and Match Flavor Combinations¬†  

Chocolate Mania: Chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, dipped in milk chocolate
Red Velvet: Red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting, dipped in white chocolate
Churro: Yellow cake, vanilla frosting (add some cinnamon to the frosting!), white chocolate, dusted with a cinnamon and sugar mixture
Carrot Cake: Carrot cake, cream cheese frosting, dipped in white chocolate


 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash

  An Expert‚Äôs Cake Pop Tips  
 Let the cake cool completely before crumbling. If you add frosting to a warm cake, it‚Äôs going to affect the consistency of the frosting.¬†Crumble the cake with a stand mixer. I‚Äôve done it by hand, and it takes a long time!¬†Don‚Äôt use too much frosting! I already mentioned this earlier, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning again. You want the mixture to hold its shape, but still be a little firm.Refrigerate after you‚Äôve combined the cake and frosting. It‚Äôll really firms things up and make it easier to roll into balls. I usually do this overnight, but you could do it in a couple of hours.Use candy melt circles for your chocolate coating. I used Ghirardelli in this recipe, but have used Wilton, and even bulk candy melts from Winco. Using regular chocolate will cause the cake pops to melt in your hands.Add a tiny bit of shortening to your coating to thin it out a bit. I personally like the consistency of a slightly runnier coating because I can dip the pops faster. I‚Äôll melt the chocolate in the microwave in a heatproof bowl in 30 second increments, and then add the shortening in 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Don‚Äôt use vegetable oil or coconut oil to thin it out. The chocolate won‚Äôt set up properly. Learn from my mistakes and stick with the shortening.¬†Use a cookie scoop to get the ball rolling‚Ä¶ Literally. Ha! I‚Äôll scoop everything out, and then go through and roll the pops. If the pops aren‚Äôt forming while you‚Äôre rolling them, take a ball, smoosh it together between your hands, and then roll.¬†


 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash

 Dip your stick into the melted chocolate and then insert it into the ball. Lay it on the cookie sheet. Once they‚Äôre all done, freeze for a half hour to really firm things up.Work with your coating in small batches. This will keep the coating from becoming too difficult to work with and from using too much chocolate.¬†Use a spoon to help get the chocolate all around the cake pop and to help smooth it out. I will twist the cake pop against the spoon to get the excess off.To really get extra chocolate off, tap the stick against the rim of the bowl while also twisting to make sure the chocolate comes off evenly. It sounds intimidating, but you‚Äôll find your groove!Place the cake pops standing up so they can harden. I used a cardboard stand I found at Walmart, but you could use a piece of Styrofoam too.¬†If you‚Äôre using sprinkles, add them while the chocolate coating is still wet! If the candy coating has hardened, dip the top of the cake pop in the chocolate and then add sprinkles. I promise no one will notice.


  Make Ahead Cake Pops  
 Cake pops aren‚Äôt something you can whip up last minute, but you can break down the process and make them ahead of time. I usually make the cake and frosting, mix it all together, and the next day (or a few days down the road) I‚Äôll do the assembly part. If the cake pop batter is in the fridge, you can leave it there (covered, of course) for about 1 week.¬†


 I don‚Äôt recommend making the pops completely and then freezing. The chocolate wouldn‚Äôt thaw very well, and you‚Äôd have a mess on your hands. If you‚Äôd like to make the cake pops without the chocolate, you can freeze in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 3 months. To thaw, pull them out of the freezer and let them sit at room temperature, then begin the chocolate dipping process (in method Step 8).

to 40 cake pops, depending on cake pop size 




 For this recipe, special equipment includes cake pop sticks, a cake pop stand, and a flower styrofoam block.You'll need 1 box of cake mix, along with ingredients listed on the package. Ingredients and amounts may vary depending on the brand of cake mix.Use candy melt circles for your chocolate coating. I used Ghirardelli in this recipe, but have used Wilton, and even bulk candy melts. Using regular chocolate will cause the cake pops to melt in your hands.

 



Cook Mode
(Keep screen awake)


 Ingredients



1 box cake mix¬†¬†


1 cup buttercream frosting


10 to 20 ounces chocolate melting wafers, divided (see recipe note)


1-2 teaspoons shortening


To decorate


Sprinkles



 







 Method


  Bake the cake:  
 Mix and bake the cake according to package directions. Any pan suggested on the back of the box will work, but I bake mine in a 9 x 13-inch pan.

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash




  Make the frosting:  
 While the cake is baking, make your frosting in a stand mixer. Transfer the frosting to another dish and keep at room temperature, but don‚Äôt worry about cleaning out the stand mixer just yet. You‚Äôll use it in the next step to crumble the cake.

Simple Tip!
Our buttercream frosting recipe makes 4 cups‚Äîyou can either cut it in half or save the leftover frosting for other uses.¬†
 





 
 Simply Recipes / Cindy Rahe




  Let the cake cool, then crumble:  
 Let the cake cool completely and then cut into roughly 8 squares. Lift each cake into the bowl where you just made the frosting. Crumble the cake mixture with the stand mixer‚Äôs paddle attachment until the cake turns into small, fine, even-sized crumbs. You don‚Äôt want any big lumps of cake left.

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash




  Combine the frosting with the cake crumbs:¬†  
 Add frosting to cake crumbs 1/4 cup at a time. Each cake mix has a different consistency, so you may end up only using 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of frosting. That‚Äôs okay! Just make sure your mixture holds its shape without being sticky.

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash




  Refrigerate the mixture:  
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours up to overnight.




  Shape the chilled mixture into balls:  
 Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the mixture onto cookie sheet using a 1-inch cookie scoop. Roll each cookie scooped piece into a ball using your hands. If you want to freeze the pops for later, now is the time to do it!¬†

Tip
To freeze balls of cake pop filling, lay them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Freeze 1 hour, then put in a freezer bag. When you‚Äôre ready to dip, take the cake pops out of the bag and lay them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper; thaw at room temperature until they‚Äôre cool to the touch. Then proceed to dip them as normal.
 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash

  Melt the chocolate:  
 Melt a little bit of chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl (or coffee mug!) in the microwave in 30-second increments. You don‚Äôt want to add too much chocolate right now, because this chocolate will be used to essentially hold the cake pops to the stick.

 If your chocolate is really thick, you can add 1/2 teaspoon of shortening at a time to the melted chocolate. Stir and melt the shortening completely. This will help thin out the chocolate if it‚Äôs too thick. You want the chocolate to have a nice drizzle to it. No need to cool the chocolate.

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash




  Assemble the cake pops:  
 Dip the tip of your cake pop stick into the melted chocolate and insert it about halfway into the cake pop. Lay the cake pop onto the cookie sheet and repeat the process for all the cake pops. Freeze for 1 to 2 hours to firm them up.

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash




  Melt the remaining chocolate:  
 Melt the rest of your chocolate, in small increments, using the method in Step 7. Be careful not to melt too much chocolate at one time, or else it will seize up. I find it‚Äôs best to work in smaller batches.




  Dip the cake pops into the chocolate:  
 Dip the cake pop into the chocolate and use a spoon to help get the chocolate all around the cake pop. Smooth the chocolate out by twisting the pop against the spoon. To get off excess chocolate, tap the cake pop against the rim of the bowl while twisting the stick.

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash




  Decorate:  
 Insert cake pop into a stand or Styrofoam. Add any sprinkles while the chocolate is still wet.¬†

 If drizzling with chocolate, melt a little chocolate and scoop into a resealable baggie. Snip a tiny corner off and drizzle the chocolate over the cake pops!

 





 
 Simply Recipes / Claudia Cash




  Enjoy:  
 Wait about 5 minutes for the chocolate to harden, then enjoy!




  Storage:  
 Keep your cake pops at room temperature for about 3 days, but good luck on getting them to last that long! Whenever I make them, my family is begging to eat them!

What is the reason behind NATO naming the Su-57 as the felon?,"NATO does not officially name Russian military aircraft. However, it is common for NATO to assign reporting names to foreign military aircraft for identification purposes. The Su-57 has not been assigned an official NATO reporting name yet. ""Felon"" is a name that has been used by some Western media outlets and defense analysts to refer to the Su-57, but it is not an official NATO designation. The reason behind this name is not clear, but it may be related to the aircraft's advanced stealth capabilities and its potential threat to Western air superiority.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/acecombat/comments/15sbz1t/so_the_su57s_designation_is_felon_really/,"You've been blocked by network security.To continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer tokenIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.Log in File a ticket"

SOS

Audio of SOS in Morse code
Problems playing this file? See media help.

SOS is a Morse code distress signal (¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†), used internationally, originally established for maritime use. In formal notation SOS is written with an overscore line (SOS), to indicate that the Morse code equivalents for the individual letters of ""SOS"" are transmitted as an unbroken sequence of three dots / three dashes / three dots, with no spaces between the letters.[1] In International Morse Code three dots form the letter ""S"" and three dashes make the letter ""O"", so ""S¬†O¬†S"" became a common way to remember the order of the dots and dashes. IWB, VZE, 3B, and V7 form equivalent sequences, but traditionally SOS is the easiest to remember.
SOS, when it was first agreed upon by the International Radio Telegraphic Convention in 1906, was merely a distinctive Morse code sequence and was initially not an abbreviation. Later a backronym was created for it in popular usage, and SOS became associated with mnemonic phrases such as ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"".[2] Moreover, due to its high-profile use in emergencies, the phrase ""SOS"" has entered general usage to informally indicate a crisis or the need for action.

The phrase ""SOS"" used on a Belgian emergency telephone traffic sign
SOS originated in German government maritime radio regulations adopted effective 1¬†April 1905. It became a worldwide standard when it was included in the service regulations of the first International Radiotelegraph Convention signed on 3¬†November 1906, which became effective on 1¬†July 1908. In modern terminology, SOS is a Morse ""procedural signal"" or ""prosign"",[3] used as a start-of-message mark for transmissions requesting assistance when loss of life or catastrophic loss of property is imminent.[4] Other prefixes are used for mechanical breakdowns, requests for medical assistance, and a relayed distress signal originally sent by another station. SOS remained the maritime radio distress signal until 1999, when it was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.[5]
SOS is still recognized as a standard distress signal that may be used with any signaling method.[6] It has been used as a visual distress signal, consisting of three short/three long/three short flashes of light,[7] such as from a survival mirror. In some cases the individual letters ""S¬†O¬†S"" have been spelled out, for example, stamped in a snowbank or formed out of logs on a beach. ""S¬†O¬†S"" being readable upside down as well as right side up (as an ambigram) is an advantage for visual recognition.

SOS sent from a flashlight

History[edit]
SOS was introduced for emergency maritime radio communication using Morse code.
Radio (initially known as ""wireless telegraphy"") was developed in the late 1890s, and was quickly recognized as an important aid to maritime communication. Previously, seagoing vessels had adopted a variety of standardized visual and audio distress signals, using such things as semaphore flags, signal flares, bells, and foghorns. However, cooperation in standardizing radio distress signals was initially limited by national differences and rivalries between competing radio companies.
In 1903, an Italian representative at the Berlin Preliminary Conference on Wireless Telegraphy, Captain Quintino Bonomo, discussed the need for common operating procedures, including the suggestion that ""ships in distress ... should send the signal SSS DDD at intervals of a few minutes"".[8] However, procedural questions were beyond the scope of this conference, so no standard signal was adopted at the time, although Article¬†IV of the conference's Final Protocol stated that ""Wireless telegraph stations should, unless practically impossible, give priority to calls for help received from ships at sea"".[9]
Without international regulations, individual organizations were left to develop their practices. On 7¬†January 1904 the Marconi International Marine Communication Company issued ""Circular¬†57"", which specified that, for the company's worldwide installations, beginning 1¬†February 1904 ""the call to be given by ships in distress or in any way requiring assistance shall be C.Q.D.""[10] An alternative proposal, put forward in 1906 by the U.S. Navy, suggested that the International Code of Signals flag signals should be adopted for radio use, including NC, which stood for ""In distress; want immediate assistance"".[11]
Germany was the first country to adopt the SOS distress signal, which it called the Notzeichen signal, as one of three Morse code sequences included in national radio regulations which became effective on 1¬†April 1905.[12][13] In 1906, the first International Radiotelegraph Convention met in Berlin, which produced an agreement signed on 3¬†November 1906 that become effective on 1¬†July 1908. The convention adopted an extensive collection of Service Regulations, including Article¬†XVI, which read: ""Ships in distress shall use the following signal: ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ¬† repeated at brief intervals"".[14]

Cunard liner RMS¬†Slavonia photographed the day it was wrecked on 10¬†June 1909; it is the earliest-reported ship to have transmitted the SOS distress call.
In both the 1¬†April 1905 German law and the 1906 international regulations, the distress signal is specified as a continuous Morse code sequence of three dots / three dashes / three dots, with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents. However there was a convention in International Morse whereby three dots comprise the letter ""S"", and three dashes the letter ""O"", and it soon became common to informally refer to the distress signal as ""S¬†O¬†S"", with the 12¬†January 1907 Electrical World stating that ""Vessels in distress use the special signal, SOS, repeated at short intervals.""[15] (In American Morse code, which was used by many coastal ships in the United States through the first part of the twentieth century, three dashes stood for the numeral¬†""5"", so in a few cases the distress signal was informally referred to as ""S¬†5¬†S"".)[16]
The first ships that have been reported to have transmitted an SOS distress call were the Cunard oceanliner RMS¬†Slavonia on 10¬†June 1909 while sailing the Azores,[17][18] and the steamer SS¬†Arapahoe on 11¬†August 1909 while off the North Carolina coast.[19][20] The signal of the Arapahoe was received by the United Wireless Telegraph Company station at Hatteras, North Carolina, and forwarded to the steamer company's offices.[21] However, there was some resistance among Marconi operators to adopting the new signal, and as late as the April¬†1912 sinking of the RMS¬†Titanic the ship's Marconi operators intermixed CQD and SOS distress calls. In the interests of consistency and maritime safety, the use of CQD appears to have died out thereafter.

Later developments[edit]
Additional warning and distress signals followed the introduction of SOS. On 20¬†January 1914, the London International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea adopted as the ""Safety Signal"" the Morse code sequence ""TTT"" ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬† (three ""T's"" (¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†))‚Äîspaced normally as three letters so as not to be confused with the three dashes of the letter O (¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ¬†)‚Äîand used for messages to ships ""involving safety of navigation and being of an urgent character""[22] but short of an emergency.

""Mayday"" voice code[edit]
With the development of audio radio transmitters, there was a need for a spoken distress phrase, and ""Mayday"" (from French m'aider ""help me"") was adopted by the 1927 International Radio Convention as the spoken equivalent of SOS.[23] For ""TTT"", the equivalent spoken signal is ""S√©curit√©"" (from French s√©curit√© ""safety"") for navigational safety, while ""Pan-pan"" (from French panne ""breakdown""; Morse ""XXX"") signals an urgent but not immediately dangerous situation.[24] French was the international language at the time that these were formalized.

World War II suffix codes[edit]
During World War II, additional codes were employed to include immediate details about attacks by enemy vessels, especially in the Battle of the Atlantic. The signal ""SSS"" signaled attacked by submarines, while ""RRR"" warned of an attack by a surface raider, ""QQQ"" warned of an unknown raider (usually an auxiliary cruiser), and ""AAA"" indicated an attack by aircraft. They were usually sent in conjunction with the SOS distress signal. All of these codes later switched from three repeats of the letter to four repeats, e.g., ""RRRR"".
None of these signals was used on its own. Sending SOS as well as the urgency signal (""XXX"" in CW, and ""PAN-PAN"" in voice)[25] and safety signal (""TTT"" in CW, and ""SECURITE"" in voice)[26] used similar procedures for effectiveness. 

Audio tone signals and automatic alarms[edit]
Ships and coastal stations would normally have required quiet times twice an hour to listen for priority signals, for 3¬†minutes, at different times for 500 kHz and 2182 kHz.

Ship's radio room clock, with 4-second-long red bands with 1-second white gaps around the circumference, so the CW alarm signal could be sent manually. The red and green wedges denote compulsory 3-minute silent periods for receiving weak distress signals.
Since many merchant vessels carried only one or two radio operators, no one might hear a distress signal when both operators were off-duty. Eventually, equipment was invented to summon operators by ringing an alarm in the operator's cabin, and on the bridge, and the only switch able to disable the alarm was only permitted to be in the wireless telegraph room.[27] The alarm was sent by the operator on the ship in distress transmitting the radiotelegraph alarm signal (auto-alarm) signal‚Äîtwelve extra-long dashes, each lasting four seconds with a one-second gap between them, and transmitted in A2 (modulated CW).[28] The alarm signal was normally sent with a mechanical or electronic timing circuit to ensure it was sent accurately. However, ships radio room clocks typically had markings on the dial to guide operators in sending the signal manually. The regulations for the auto-alarm were defined in the 1927 Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) international maritime regulations, and in Article¬†19, ¬ß¬†21, of the General Regulations annexed to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, 1927.5¬†5.[27]
The Auto Alarm receivers were designed to activate upon receiving four such dashes. Once four valid dashes are detected, the automatic alarm is activated. The distressed ship's operator would then delay sending the SOS message itself to give off-watch radio operators time to reach their radio room.
The radiotelephony equivalent of the radiotelegraph alarm signal is the radiotelephony alarm signal, which is the transmission of alternating tones of 2200¬†Hz and 1300¬†Hz, with each tone having a duration of 250¬†ms. Automatic alarm systems aboard ships must activate when such a signal is received and the receiving vessel is within 500¬†nmi (930¬†km) of the transmitting vessel's position, or if the distress position is in the polar areas (latitude greater than 70¬∞¬†N or 70¬∞¬†S). The alarm should also activate when the call is received and the distance between the vessel in distress and the receiving vessel cannot be determined.[29]

What new economies developed because of the anti-slave treaties?,"The anti-slave treaties contributed to the development of new economies based on industries such as palm oil, rubber, and mining in Africa. These industries replaced the slave trade as a primary source of profit for European traders, who were now more interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources rather than its people. Additionally, the abolitionist movement in Europe led to an increased demand for African raw materials, which further stimulated the development of these new economies. This shift marked the beginning of European imperialism and Africa's economic integration into the global economy.",False,https://humanrights.ca/story/story-black-slavery-canadian-history,"The story of Black slavery in Canadian history | CMHR     Skip to main contentAccept Cookie Policy  We use cookies to enhance your experience on our website.

We celebrate being a destination for freedom‚Äêseeking enslaved Americans fleeing to the north. But Canada also has its own long history of slavery, and the legacy of slavery lives on in anti‚ÄêBlack racism in Canada today.Practices of enslavement in what is now Canada predate the arrival of Europeans. Some Indigenous peoples enslaved prisoners taken in war.1¬†Europeans brought a different kind of slavery to North America, however.Many Europeans saw enslaved people merely as property to be bought and sold.2¬†This ‚Äúchattel slavery‚Äù was a dehumanizing and violent system of abuse and subjugation. Importantly, Europeans viewed slavery in racist terms. Indigenous and African peoples were seen as less than human. This white supremacy justified the violence of slavery for hundreds of¬†years.The slave trade inflicted unimaginable suffering on millions of people. It also created racist stereotypes and biases that live on in Canadian society even now, almost 200¬†years after the abolition of slavery.

Photo: Library of Congress, Rare Books and Special Collections Division  What was the transatlantic slave¬†trade?In the 15th century, European colonial powers began the large‚Äêscale practice of transporting enslaved people from Africa. Slave traders shipped them under horrifying conditions across the Atlantic. Colonial authorities and landowners forced them to serve as slave labour in the Caribbean and in North and South America.¬†A pattern emerged called ""triangular trade."" European merchants brought trade goods from Europe to Africa. In Africa, they exchanged their goods for enslaved people. In the Americas, the surviving enslaved people were sold, and goods produced by slave labour were carried back to Europe for¬†sale.More than 12 million African people were taken into slavery. At least two million more died en route across the Atlantic. The widespread violence of slave raids and kidnappings killed and displaced millions more.European colonizers held a racist double standard about slavery. Slavery had been illegal in France and England for hundreds of years. And yet both England and France freely enslaved millions of Black people in their faraway colonies. The transatlantic slave trade was thus a distinctively colonial and white supremacist form of violence and exploitation. It was a key aspect of European imperialism and exploitation across half the¬†world.      View image in fullscreen gallery	A map of the Atlantic Ocean and its bounding continents.

Source: CMHR  Slavery in New FranceThe colony of New France was founded in the early 1600s. It was the first major European colonial settlement in what is now Canada. Slavery was a common practice in the territory. When New France was conquered by the British in 1758‚Äì1760, records revealed that approximately 3,600 enslaved people had lived there since its beginnings.3¬†The majority of them were Indigenous (often called ‚ÄúPanis‚Äù4). Black enslaved people were also present because of the transatlantic slave¬†trade.King Louis XIV authorized the importing of enslaved Black people to New France in 1689, at the request of the colonial government. In 1709, New France passed laws that explicitly legalized slavery and defined slaves as property ‚Äì and thus as having no rights.A set of regulations called the Code Noir governed slavery in most French colonies. It‚Äôs unclear if the Code Noir formally applied in New France, but it strongly influenced the customs and practice of slavery there.5      View image in fullscreen gallery	The cover page of an old book in French, titled ‚ÄúCode Noir‚Äù and illustrated with a head-and-shoulders caricature of a Black person. Cover page of a copy of the Code noir (Black Code) from¬†1743. Photo: Biblioth√®que nationale de France  Colonial slave laws such as the Code Noir provided a few minimal protections to enslaved people. The Code required owners to provide slaves with food, shelter, and clothing. But it also empowered slave owners to inflict violent punishments on slaves, including branding, mutilating and even killing them.Free Black people in New France were at constant risk of being enslaved. In 1732, Governor Jonquierre enslaved a Black freedom seeker who had arrived from New England on the basis that ‚Äúa black is a slave, wherever he may be found.‚Äù6  	The runaway slave‚Ä¶shall have his ears cut off, and shall be branded with the fleur de lis on the shoulder‚Ä¶. On the third offence, he shall suffer death.	Article 32 of the 2nd edition of the Code Noir   Share this Quote    Facebook   facebook     X   X   Slavery in British North AmericaSlavery continued after the British formally took control of New France in 1763. The formal agreements that ended the war affirmed the continued enslavement of Black and Indigenous people.The era of British rule saw an increase in the number of Black enslaved people in Canada. In the late 1770s and early 1780s, Loyalists fleeing from the newly independent United States brought hundreds of enslaved Black people with them. John Simcoe, the first governor of Upper Canada (now Ontario), was surprised at how many colonists owned slaves when he arrived in 1792.7Early Canada is sometimes described as a ‚Äúsociety with slaves‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúslave society."" At the time, much of the Caribbean and the southern United States were slave societies. There, large‚Äêscale slave labour on plantations was a dominant force in economics, politics and culture.8Enslaved people made up a smaller proportion of the population in early Canada than in plantation economies. This meant they toiled in relative isolation, which inhibited the creation of shared community. It possibly enabled even more intense surveillance by white society.9       View image in fullscreen gallery	An old newspaper advertisement advertising the sale of an enslaved woman and her child, a 13-year-old enslaved boy and a horse and carriage. An announcement of the sale of enslaved people. It appeared in the Quebec Gazette in May 1785. One of the horrors of slavery was that enslaved people were treated as property rather than as human beings. Photo: Quebec Gazette  White colonists of many walks of life owned slaves. Merchants owned the largest number, but farmers, the political elite, and the Church were also slave owners. Enslaved people acted as servants, as farm labour and as skilled artisans. Their forced labour contributed to the success and prosperity of the British colonies that became modern Canada.The nature of slavery meant that its victims were stripped of their basic human rights, exploited for labour, and subjected to arbitrary violence and suffering. Most wills from the time treated enslaved people as nothing more than property, passing on ownership of human beings exactly as they would furniture, cattle or land.10Slave owners subjected enslaved people to terrible working and living conditions. Physical and sexual abuse was a constant threat. Enslaved people lived tremendously difficult, very short lives. Enslaved Black people in New France, for instance, died at an average age of only 25.11  	This is what needs to be acknowledged in Canada‚Ä¶. We‚Äôre talking about, within these Canadian colonies, enslaved Africans‚Ä¶who had all kinds of violence committed upon their bodies.	Afua Cooper, James Robinson Johnston Chair in Black Canadian Studies (2011-2017), Dalhousie University   Share this Quote    Facebook   facebook     X   X   Resistance, escape and activismEnslaved people often resisted the institution of slavery. They fought back in many ways: by asserting their humanity in the face of a system that wished to deny it to them, by running away from slave holders or by assisting other freedom seekers. In fact, in 1777, a number of enslaved people fled from British North America into the state of Vermont, which had abolished slavery in that same year.12Public campaigns against slavery took hold in England in the late 1700s. Formerly enslaved Black authors and activists, such as Ignatius Sancho and Olaudah Equiano, were influential in the abolitionist fight. From the 1770s on, popular memoirs of slavery and widely publicized court cases that freed enslaved people inspired a growing resistance to slavery in England.      View image in fullscreen gallery	An old newspaper advertisement titled ‚ÄúTwenty Dollars Reward‚Äù and illustrated with a small drawing of a Black person running while looking over their shoulder. An advertisement offering $20 for the capture of an escaped enslaved person in Nova Scotia, dating from March of 1794. Many enslaved people made similar attempts to win freedom. Photo: Nova Scotia Archives, Weekly Chronicle 15 March 1794 p. 1 [microfilm no. 8165]  Abolitionist sentiments took longer to reach Canada. But by the turn of the 1800s, attitudes to slavery among the free population of British North America were beginning to change. Accounts of dehumanizing violence and moral arguments against slavery began appearing in newspapers.Despite the influx of enslaved people in the early 1780s, few people remained enslaved in Canada by the late 1790s.13¬†Slavery remained legal, however, and pro‚Äêslavery merchants and politicians attempted to keep it that¬†way.The abolition of slavery in British North AmericaIn 1793, a Black man named Peter Martin petitioned Governor Simcoe to act against a slave owner who had violently transported an enslaved Black woman, Chloe Cooley, from Upper Canada to the United States to be sold. This slave owner‚Äôs actions were entirely legal at the time, and this case seems to have inspired Simcoe to introduce the first anti‚Äêslavery law in British North America.Upper Canada passed an Act in 1793 intended to gradually end the practice of slavery. The law made it illegal to bring enslaved people into Upper Canada and declared that children born to enslaved people would be freed once they reached 25¬†years of age. It did not free any enslaved people directly, but any enslaved person who arrived in Upper Canada would be considered free.14A similar act failed to pass in Lower Canada (now Quebec) thanks to pressure from influential slave owners ‚Äì including elected representatives ‚Äì who blocked it. But even in the absence of outright prohibition, the legal status of slavery was weakening. Throughout the early 1800s, courts in various colonial jurisdictions (notably Lower Canada and Nova Scotia) ruled against slave owners and freed formerly enslaved people.15On March 25, 1807, the slave trade was abolished throughout the British Empire, including British North America. This made it illegal to buy or sell human beings and so ended British participation in the transatlantic slave trade. But it didn‚Äôt outlaw holding and exploiting enslaved people. The overall practice of slavery was abolished everywhere in the British Empire in 1834. Notably, Prince Edward Island had already pronounced the complete abolition of slavery in 1825.16  	How can slaves be happy when they have the halter round their neck and the whip upon their back? And are disgraced and thought no more of than beasts?	Mary Prince, The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave (1831)   Share this Quote    Facebook   facebook     X   X   After the slave¬†tradeThe abolition of slavery allowed the British colonies in North America to become a destination for escaped enslaved people in the United States who made their way North via the famous Underground Railroad. This was an informal network of people, organizations, hiding places, homes, routes, transportation networks and tactics that supported freedom seekers in their clandestine escape from slavery.However, Black people in Canada still faced considerable racism in the colonies (later, a country) that had practiced slavery for over 200¬†years. Racist attitudes and practices sharply limited Black people‚Äôs opportunities.Segregated education was legally enforced in Upper Canada in the 1850s.17¬†Informal segregation still marginalized Black people a hundred years later, when Viola Desmond faced anti‚ÄêBlack racism in education and at the theatre. Many other Black Canadians resisted the practice of segregation¬†in the first half of the 20th century.Until the Second World War, the vast majority of working Black women were restricted to being domestic servants.18¬†Some trade unions were explicitly anti‚ÄêBlack through the 1950s. Sleeping car porters¬†were the first Black workers to organize their own union to fight for better pay and working conditions.Formal protection from racist education, employment, and housing restrictions only began to appear in the 1950s and 1960s. Various provinces passed laws imposing fair employment practices and created bills of rights and the first human rights commissions.19¬†But as the Black Lives Matter movement shows, the struggle against anti‚ÄêBlack racism continues in 21st century Canada.20Slavery was legal and practiced in early Canada for longer than it has been abolished. And many racist ideas, stereotypes, and practices that live on today have their roots in the dehumanization of Black people that justified and sustained the slave trade.21  	Though formalized Black bondage was officially over, the meaning of Blackness had been consolidated under slavery.

Under the system of indentured servitude, individuals signed a contract committing perform unpaid labour for a set number of years in exchange for transport, shelter and¬†food.Indentured servitude was cruel and exploitative but very different to slavery. At the end of their contracts, indentured servants were free to go, and sometimes received a payment of land and goods. In contrast, slavery defined humans as property and involved lifelong forced labour.

How to Swim Safely in the Ocean or at the Beach










Play Video




















Be Aware of Hazards & Weather



Being water competent in the ocean requires stronger and different skills than in a pool. Whenever you are at the beach, ocean or other open water environment, watch and prepare for:¬† ¬†

Changing tides.
Fast-moving currents and waves, even in shallow water.
Drop-offs that unexpectedly change water depth.
Unexpected changes in air or water temperature.
Hazards, such as underwater obstacles, rocks and debris.
Vegetation, marine animals and fish.
Other people‚Äôs activities in the same waters, such as boating.
Thunder & Lightning. ¬† ¬†
Leave the water immediately, if swimming off shore.
If you‚Äôre out in a boat, head back to shore as quickly as possible.
If you‚Äôre unable to get to shore, lie down in the bottom of the boat or shelter in the cabin if available.






Establish and Enforce Rules and Safe Behaviors




Enter the water feet first for your safety!
Always enter unknown or shallow water cautiously.
Only dive in water clearly marked as safe for diving, at least 9 feet deep with no underwater obstacles. Never dive head first into surf!


Do not enter the water from a height, such as a bridge or boat.
Be careful when standing to prevent being knocked over by currents or waves.
Swim sober.
Supervise others sober and without distractions, such as reading or talking on or using a cell phone.
Swim with a buddy even in lifeguarded areas.




Take These Water Safety Steps




Employ layers of protection including barriers to prevent access to water, life jackets, and close supervision of children to prevent drowning.
Ensure every member of your family learns to swim so they at least achieve skills of water competency: able to enter the water, get a breath, stay afloat, change position, swim a distance then get out of the water safely.
Know what to do in a water emergency ‚Äì including how to help someone in trouble in the water safely, call for emergency help and CPR.





















Be Aware of the Dangers of Rip Currents




Responsible for most rescues performed by lifeguards, rip currents can form in any large open water area (including the Great Lakes), such as low spots and breaks in sandbars, or near structures such as jetties and piers.



How to Avoid Rip Currents




Check conditions before entering the water: are any warning flags up? Ask a lifeguard about water conditions, beach conditions, and potential hazards.
While in the water, stay at least 100 feet away from piers and jetties. Permanent rip currents often exist near these structures.




How to Escape from a Rip Current




If you are caught in a rip current, stay calm and don‚Äôt fight it.
Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current. Then, turn and swim to shore.
Alternately, float or tread water until you are free of the rip current and then head to shore.


If you can‚Äôt make it to shore, draw attention to yourself by waving and calling for help.




If Someone Else Is Caught in a Rip Current




If someone is in trouble in the water, get help from a lifeguard.
If a lifeguard is not available, have someone call 9-1-1.
Throw the victim something that floats ‚Äì such as a lifejacket, cooler or inflatable ball ‚Äì and yell instructions on how to escape the current. Do not attempt a rescue yourself unless you are a trained beach lifeguard.

U.S. presidents and slavery


12 of the first 18 American presidents owned slaves

The history of the American presidency‚Äôs relationship to slavery is a complicated one that touches on two main issues: presidential ownership of slaves and the handling of slavery as a political issue. This essay provides a basic overview of the importance of slavery in early America and then discusses several presidents who were enslavers, while also considering how different presidents navigated the struggle between slavery and freedom during the first hundred years of the American republic.Slavery in the early United StatesThe United States of America came into existence in 1789, but the practice of enslavement had existed and thrived in the British colonies for more than a century-and-a-half before.Most historians date the beginning of the enslavement of Africans in what became the United States back to 1619 when enslaved Africans arrived in the Virginia colony. In colonies such as Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina, slavery would become the driving economic force in the agricultural economy. In the 17th century, English demand for cash crops such as tobacco required a large number of laborers to grow, cultivate, and harvest. White colonists initially attempted to enslave Native Americans with limited success. For much of the 17th century, they also drew on a system of indentured servitude, in which laborers would work without pay for a period of time to gain their freedom. However, white landowners began to rely on enslavement by about 1660, when the number of enslaved people in the colonies jumped to about 2,800. By 1700, white colonists had forcibly moved about 27,000 Africans to the North American colonies. The number of enslaved people was almost 460,000 on the eve of the American Revolution, and then 700,000 by the founding of the United States.1¬†By the 1860 census, the United States had almost 4 million enslaved people.

From the beginning, enslaved people in the colonies and early United States lived under horrific conditions. Most lived outdoors in small wooden quarters with little ventilation or protection from harsh weather. Some were expected to work indoors to assist with the functioning of homes, but many more labored in fields and on plantations, exposed to the elements, such as grueling heat and bitter cold.Enslavers used enslaved people for a wide range of labor, though the largest number of enslaved people labored on large plantations to harvest agricultural commodities such as cotton and sugar. But slavery was not limited to plantations, and people who resided in urban areas also held enslaved people and required them to labor in a number of different roles.

Enslavers relied on violence to compel enslaved people to labor and used violence when and where they pleased. Most infamously, these enslavers used the whip to punish enslaved people who did not meet expectations. Enslavers‚Äô most brutal form of torture, however, was the use of family separation for the slave trade. Husbands, wives, children, and even infants, were torn from their families and sold.For some historians, the simultaneous rise of slavery and the American Revolution is a ‚Äúparadox‚Äù that requires explanation. This paradox only grows in consequence when we consider that some of the loudest advocates for Americans‚Äô ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù from British ‚Äútyranny‚Äù were themselves enslavers. Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Continental Congress and later president of the United States, was an enslaver when he wrote the famous opening lines of the Declaration of Independence: ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.‚Äù Was Jefferson considering enslaved African and African American people to be among those who were ‚Äúequal,‚Äù possessed of ‚Äúunalienable Rights‚Äù of ‚ÄúLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness‚Äù?

Slavery was a contentious issue during the debates that ultimately resulted in the writing and ratification of the United States Constitution between 1787 and 1789. While enslavement, and the use of enslaved labor for agricultural labor in particular, was already an engrained practice in the economic systems of numerous colonies‚Äîespecially those in the South‚Äîthe 18th century had also witnessed the emergence of a powerful group of antislavery political leaders. These antislavery leaders viewed the American Revolution‚Äôs emphasis on liberty as an opportunity to abolish slavery.Meanwhile, representatives from states that had grown dependent on slavery demanded that the new US Constitution not interfere with the existing conditions. Ultimately, slavery‚Äôs defenders secured a few key provisions in the new Constitution: they would be able to count every enslaved person as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of apportioning representatives in Congress, thereby increasing their political power; they would be able to pursue and reclaim enslaved people who ran away to other states as ‚Äúfugitive slaves‚Äù; and the international slave trade would remain open until 1808.Scholars continue to debate whether the Constitution was proslavery, antislavery, or a bit of both. What is undeniable is that when the dust settled on the American Revolution and the creation of the new United States in 1789, slavery remained a key‚Äîif not the key‚Äîpart of the new republic. Slavery in the early American republic would continue to grow and to structure the economic and social conditions in the Southern states, beginning with the original states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, and then expanding to new states over the next several decades: Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, and Texas. Notably, however, when the new Constitution came into effect, there were no ‚Äúfree‚Äù states. Even as most Northern states enacted gradual ‚Äúemancipation‚Äù laws that slowly reduced the number of enslaved people in those states, slavery would persist in many of these states until the Civil War.White leaders in Southern states built a system of law to govern the enslaved population by emulating slave codes from other English or European colonies in the West Indies. These laws were noteworthy for their brutality as they frequently relied on whippings as punishments for minor ‚Äúcrimes.‚Äù One key example of these laws was a surveillance system known as ‚Äúpass laws,‚Äù that allowed any white person to ask any Black person for a written ‚Äúpass‚Äù if that Black person was found unaccompanied in public. If the purportedly enslaved person lacked a pass or if the inspecting white person found something suspicious, the white person had the authority to arrest the Black person.

Slave patrols, or police forces that policed public spaces, usually after sundown, were also common. Patrols that apprehended enslaved people often relied on harsh whippings. These slave codes also prescribed capital punishment for enslaved people accused of crimes such as threatening or attacking a white person or running away for so long as to be classed as an ‚Äúoutlaw.‚Äù In tandem with plantation and household rules governing enslaved people‚Äôs workdays and privileges, the laws governing slavery meant that enslaved people faced extremely harsh restrictions and vicious violence when captors and public officials deemed them to have violated rules or laws.

Facing this legal apparatus, as well as the violence that enslavers routinely meted out, enslaved people nonetheless managed to defiantly survive, build families, and create communities. Enslaved people on plantations and elsewhere often organized their own religious practices and operated their own systems of exchange and commerce. In other words, even against the reality of laws and violence that tried to erase their humanitiy, enslaved people strove to control their daily lives as much as possible.Presidents and slaveryUntil the Civil War, US presidents were deeply involved with slavery in three main ways. First, many early presidents were themselves enslavers, though their specific roles varied from deeply involved in the day-to-day management of enslaved people‚Äôs lives and activities, to more distantly involved. Second, presidents signed legislation and administered government policies that had important effects on slavery as an economic system. Finally, in some cases, presidential administrations were affected by the impact of political issues that revolved around slavery.Twelve of the 18 presidents who held office between 1789 and 1877 owned slaves in various capacities: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Andrew Johnson, and Ulysses Grant. Notably, four of the first five presidents were enslavers, with Washington, Jefferson, and Madison owning several hundred people. Andrew Jackson and Zachary Taylor also owned about two hundred and three hundred, respectively. John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, and Abraham Lincoln were the only US presidents not to own slaves in these years. The striking reality that many of the nation‚Äôs key political founders were enslavers led historian Edmund S. Morgan to contemplate the paradox that the same men who propounded important principles of individual freedom did so while enslaving almost an entire race of people.2George WashingtonWhen George Washington was eleven years old, his father died, and Washington inherited a small estate and ten enslaved people. He continued to increase the number of enslaved people under his control throughout his life. Washington‚Äôs estate, Mount Vernon, housed hundreds of enslaved people, some of whom Washington had purchased through the slave trade, and others who had been born into enslavement under Washington‚Äôs control. After Washington married Martha Custis, she brought more than 80 enslaved people with her to Mount Vernon.¬†

Most of Washington‚Äôs slaves labored in Mount Vernon‚Äôs fields while others worked near or within the Washington home. Like many Virginia plantation owners, Washington used overseers to supervise labor and to mete out verbal admonitions and physical beatings when he deemed them necessary. Washington often made the final decision about these whippings and was also known to personally use harsh language toward slaves he believed were not doing their work. However, Washington was also known to believe enslaved people deserved basic food and shelter, and he disfavored excessive punishment. Today, visitors to Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon can see recreations of the small quarters in which enslaved people lived.Even as the owner of several hundred enslaved people over his lifetime, Washington had complicated views toward slavery. As the American Revolution gained steam, he helped frame the Fairfax Resolves, which protested British actions and criticized the Atlantic slave trade. Washington understood Britain‚Äôs treatment of the North American colonies as similar to the relationship between enslaver and enslaved. During the War of Independence, however, he did not believe that free or enslaved Black people should serve in the Continental Army until British attempts to recruit Black soldiers forced his hand.3During the war, Washington also instructed the man supervising Mount Vernon to reduce the number of Black slaves, while also noting that he did not want to separate families through slave sales.4¬†However, after the war, Washington led a decade-long quest to recapture one of his former slaves, Ona Judge, who had escaped and settled in New Hampshire. As historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar has shown, as president, Washington used a strategy of moving his slaves back and forth from the national capital of Philadelphia to Virginia, to avoid the possibility of his slaves taking advantage of Pennsylvania‚Äôs legal pathway to freedom if an enslaved person lived in the state for more than six months.5 Washington further complicated his personal legacy with slavery by including in his will a plan to free one slave and to manumit those under his control‚Äîroughly over a hundred‚Äîafter the death of his wife, Martha. Of the more than 300 enslaved people at Mount Vernon when Washington died, about half of them were owned by the estate of Martha‚Äôs first husband, and neither she nor George had the legal right to free them; Martha‚Äôs heirs inherited them after her death.

As president, Washington made two major policy decisions that signaled support for the institution of slavery. First, he oversaw an unsuccessful program of support for the French government as it contended with a massive slave rebellion in the colony of Saint-Domingue, which eventually became the Haitian Revolution.6 Second, and most notably, he signed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793, which provided a mechanism for enslavers to invoke the right‚Äîfrom the US Constitution‚Äôs Fugitive Slave Clause‚Äîto pursue and reclaim people who had fled enslavement to states with less slavery. And despite his reservations about the slave trade in 1774, Washington brushed off a 1791 entreaty from the Quaker community demanding an end to the slave trade. However, Washington also signed the 1787 version of the Northwest Ordinance, which granted freedom to enslaved people forcibly moved into the Northwest Territory after 1787. He also signed a law that prohibited United States citizens or foreigners living in the United States from involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, though the law had little effect on the scope of the trade.7Thomas Jefferson

When Thomas Jefferson won the presidential election of 1800, he had been an enslaver for almost 50 years. Like Washington, Jefferson had inherited slaves as a child after his father‚Äôs death in 1757, and he later inherited more than a hundred slaves after his father-in-law died in 1773. Jefferson‚Äôs slaves were held captive at his main residence, Monticello, near Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as other locations in the state. Jefferson closely controlled the management of slave labor at Monticello. He generally did not believe in separating families of enslaved people because keeping them together would lead to reproduction and natural population growth, obviating the need to buy new slaves through the slave trade.8¬†Violence against enslaved people was common at Monticello, although Jefferson likely did not personally whip or otherwise physically torture them.9According to historian Annette Gordon-Reed, Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs sexual interactions with an enslaved woman, Sally Hemings, likely led to her giving birth to six or seven children. Gordon-Reed points to the preferential treatment of the Hemings children as circumstantial evidence that Jefferson more closely regarded them than any other enslaved people at Monticello: several were spared onerous labor as children, and all were eventually freed.10¬†Moreover, Gordon-Reed has traced how since Jefferson‚Äôs death, historians and other invested in preserving Jefferson‚Äôs reputation had purposefully obscured the Hemings connection. DNA testing in the late 1990s suggested strongly that he could not be ruled out as the father, and most scholarly historians now view it as likely that he was.11

As president and in his private life and writings, Jefferson developed a contradictory record on slavery. He directed the Louisiana Purchase, which eventually led to the massive growth of plantation slavery in the Gulf South and beyond.12¬†Yet he also permitted American merchants to trade with Haitian revolutionaries against French enslavers and the French government, and in 1808 he signed a law that criminalized participation in the international slave trade. In his autobiography, Jefferson suggested that slavery would eventually end and that Black enslaved people would be freed. Yet, in his earlier and popular work,¬†Notes on the State of Virginia, Jefferson wrote that Black people were inferior to whites. Perhaps most damning was Jefferson‚Äôs lack of care for the enslaved people at Monticello after his death, as more than one hundred were sold to help cover Jefferson‚Äôs debts, leading to the traumatic separation of families and their removal from Monticello.13James MadisonJames Madison, who succeeded Thomas Jefferson as president in 1809, came from a large slaveholding family in Orange County, Virginia. When Madison went to Princeton University in 1769, he brought an enslaved person named Sawney with him, and Sawney would later go on to become a trusted overseer of the Madison family estate, Montpelier. In his lifetime, Madison emancipated only one enslaved person, Billey. Billey went to Philadelphia with Madison and lived with him during the time of the Continental Congress. Madison believed that Billey had learned too much about what it meant to be free to return to live as a slave. Billey, Madison seemed to fear, might teach other enslaved people about the freedom he had experienced in the North and endanger the institution of slavery at Montpelier. The rest of the people Madison owned as slaves he bequeathed to his wife.14

Madison‚Äôs political thought, which is widely considered pivotal to the creation of the United States, featured ambivalence about the morality and importance of slavery. On one hand, especially during the height of the American Revolution, Madison questioned whether slavery should be a fundamental part of the American experience. At the Constitutional Convention, he criticized the slave trade and quipped that it would be wrong to codify in the Constitution the principle that human beings could be held as property.15But Madison‚Äôs brief dalliance with antislavery thought receded by the time he was secretary of state during the Jefferson administration. When Madison became president, he imported to the White House several enslaved people from Montpelier. Scholars have identified that President Madison, and especially First Lady Dolley Madison, turned the White House into a key venue for political activity, and slave labor proved to be pivotal to these efforts.16Madison‚Äôs post-presidential life exemplified his contradictory philosophical and personal dealings with slavery. During the Virginia constitutional convention in 1829, Madison insisted that both free and enslaved African Americans should be counted for purposes of representation in the state legislature. However, as historian Paris Amanda Spies-Gans explains, Madison abandoned his ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù when he sold enslaved people to cope with mounting financial woes at Montpelier.17¬†Fifteen years after leaving the White House, James Madison became president of the American Colonization Society, which was founded in 1816 and advocated for the deportation of the free Black population in the United States to colonies in Africa.James MonroeJames Monroe was born to a prosperous family in Virginia. After the death of his parents, Monroe and his siblings shared an inheritance of land and enslaved people. In 1799, James Monroe and his family moved to Highland, a plantation worked by enslaved people outside of Charlottesville, Virgina. After fighting in the American Revolution and becoming a mentee of Thomas Jefferson, Monroe became involved in politics. During his time as governor of Virginia, Monroe dealt with Gabriel‚Äôs Rebellion in 1800, when he called out the local military guard to thwart a planned slave uprising in Richmond, Virginia. This event led Monroe to support colonization out of a desire to protect the white population of Virginia from possible slave rebellions. By deporting the free Black community, Monroe believed, slavery in Virginia would be less susceptible to the kind of unrest that had occurred during Gabriel‚Äôs Rebellion.

Notably, African American criticism of the American Colonization Society (ACS) was fierce and persistent; they argued that Blacks had lived in the United States for generations, and it was their home.18¬†African Americans also saw colonization as a way to protect the interest of slaveowners and remove the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of free Blacks. While Monroe was president, Congress appropriated $100,000 to the ACS, and the transportation of African Americans to Liberia began in 1820. The ACS memorialized Monroe‚Äôs support for the project by naming the colony‚Äôs capital city Monrovia.19¬†The ACS continued to capture the attention of American politicians in years to come, including future President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln had supported colonization in the 1840s until after the Emancipation Proclamation, when African American critics finally convinced him to abandon the scheme.20From a policy perspective, Monroe‚Äôs term as president is important because he signed the law that would come to be known as the ‚ÄúMissouri Compromise,‚Äù which admitted Missouri as a state where slavery was legal, while Maine entered the Union as a state without legalized slavery. From one perspective, the Missouri Compromise ensured that new states created north of the 36 30‚Äô parallel line would be states without slavery. However, the Compromise also hardened the divide between slave and ‚Äúfree‚Äù states and set the tone for the divisive political debates between the sections of the nation for decades to come.Andrew JacksonAndrew Jackson had a large number of enslaved people who worked in the cotton fields of his plantation, The Hermitage, nearby Nashville, Tennessee. Jackson participated in the slave trade in order to grow his slave labor force to more than 150 people by the time he died in 1845. As master, Jackson‚Äôs concern for the preservation of his wealth and property meant that he demanded that overseers and others responsible for the daily management of operations at The Hermitage avoid excessive violence toward the enslaved population.

On the other hand, Jackson demanded vicious retribution against enslaved people when he wanted it. Infamously, he once wrote an advertisement for the capture of a slave named ‚ÄúTom Gid‚Äù who had run away from The Hermitage that offered ten dollars extra for ‚Äúevery hundred lashes‚Äù the captor laid on the captive.21¬†Above all, concludes historian and Jackson biographer Mark R. Cheathem, Jackson approached his enslaved population with the kind of paternalism that was characteristic of elite Southern planters of the time.22¬†He saw his role as controlling the day-to-day lives of his enslaved population so their labor could support his family and lifestyle.

As president, Jackson‚Äôs commitment to preserving the Union led him to take decisive measures against the most influential proslavery and antislavery voices of the time. Jackson‚Äôs handling of the ‚ÄúNullification Crisis‚Äù in 1833 pit him against elite planters in South Carolina, who had devised a legal theory that gave South Carolina the power to nullify certain federal laws. They wanted to nullify federal laws in response to a federal tariff law that South Carolina‚Äôs political leaders claimed was punitive against them (and other slave states), but the subtext of the controversy was to defend slavery against the purported rising tide of antislavery ideology in the North. Jackson rejected the doctrine of nullification and mobilized US military forces to invade South Carolina if the state persisted.23Late in Jackson‚Äôs second term, in contrast, the president directed Postmaster Amos Kendall to allow Southern postmasters to seize abolitionist literature in the mail. Jackson, and other critics of abolitionism, believed that the transmission of these pamphlets in the mail would circulate revolutionary sentiments among enslaved and free Black people. Thus he mobilized a key part of the federal government, the US Postal Service, to act for the benefit of enslavers.24Presidents Taylor, Van Buren, Tyler, and PolkOf the other presidents who owned slaves, Zachary Taylor benefited the most from slave labor. He had inherited two slaves from his father, but later purchased a plantation in Mississippi that included a large number of enslaved persons. Taylor served only two years as president before dying in office, but he had enslaved servants in the White House while also supervising his Mississippi plantation‚Äôs operations from the nation‚Äôs capital. Like Jackson, Taylor demanded that his overseers treat enslaved people with care in order to protect his financial investment, rather than out of humanitarian concerns.

However, Taylor‚Äôs record as president suggests that he was more broadly aware of the moral evils of slavery. Taylor opposed expansion of slavery into the territories, much to the chagrin of expectant slave state politicians, who had assumed that they had his support. Likewise, Taylor vowed to veto the ‚ÄúCompromise of 1850,‚Äù that included the draconian Fugitive Slave Law. This law, which was signed by Taylor‚Äôs successor, Millard Fillmore, granted enslavers greater authority to seize supposed fugitive slaves in Northern states, as well as other extremely controversial measures.25Most of the remaining presidents who owned slaves supported the political cause of slavery. The exception was Martin Van Buren, who was president from 1837 to 1841. Van Buren‚Äôs slave, Tom, ran away before Van Buren‚Äôs ascent in politics, and Tom lived free in Worcester, Massachusetts. A slave catcher offered to capture Tom, but Van Buren, who became an ardent opponent of slavery after he left office, never finalized the agreement.26Van Buren‚Äôs immediate successor, William Henry Harrison, owned slaves by inheritance and, while Governor of Indiana, had previously attempted to liberalize slaveowning there.27¬†After Harrison died in office, John Tyler, another enslaver who was part of a prominent slaveowning family in Virginia , became president. Perhaps most importantly, Tyler and his Secretary of State Abel Upshur‚Äîcounseled by no less a proslavery ideologue than John C. Calhoun‚Äîoversaw the annexation of Texas as a slave state in December 1845.28¬†President James K. Polk owned several plantations and even purchased enslaved people during his presidential tenure. As an absentee plantation owner, Polk gave his overseers vast authority to police the enslaved population, one of whom would become infamous for his brutality.29Slavery's long shadowSlavery died a slow and uneven death in the United States. After the American Revolution, slavery was found in every state in the Union. During the early American republic, gradual emancipation laws in many Northern states slowly whittled slave ownership to extremely low levels, although many Northern and Midwestern states retained harsh restrictions on free Black people and on fugitive slaves.30¬†Antislavery partisans and abolitionists, often led by African Americans themselves, worked to permanently end slavery, which came to fruition during the American Civil War.

On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all slaves in areas still in rebellion during the American Civil War and made destroying slavery a Union war objective.¬†Credit: Popular Graphic Arts

Famously, President Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, declared that ‚Äúall persons held as slaves‚Äù in the Confederacy ‚Äúshall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.‚Äù31¬†This measure technically brought freedom to more than three million African Americans who were being held as slaves in the Confederate states although many had to wait until the South was defeated in 1865 to realize their freedom. Enslaved people who did not live in the Confederate States had to wait for the Thirteenth Amendment of the US Constitution to take effect in December 1865.The Thirteenth Amendment was perhaps the most momentous single amendment because it ended two practices‚Äîslavery and involuntary servitude‚Äîthat¬†¬†had been key drivers of the national economy and cultural foundations for Southern life in particular. Slavery had powered the plantation economy that led to the mass production of cotton, sugar, and other crops; it had been used to build the public infrastructure of much of the South and even major parts of the White House; it had undergirded white supremacy.

In 1864, Congress, dominated by a Republican Party that was widely supportive of ending slavery, guided the legislation that became the Thirteenth Amendment over the initial opposition of Democrats. President Lincoln remained quiet on the measure until after he won reelection in November 1864, because he was concerned that outward support for ending slavery might jeopardize his chances.¬†¬†After reelection, however, Lincoln and his administration threw their support behind whipping votes to ensure congressional approval. Lincoln‚Äôs Secretary of State William H. Seward was even suspected of bribing reluctant members of Congress.Finally, on February 1, 1865, President Lincoln signed the text of what would become the Thirteenth Amendment after passage by the House and Senate.32¬†The states ratified the amendment within the coming months, with some notable exceptions: Texas ratified in 1870, Delaware in 1901, Kentucky in 1976, and Mississippi in 1995. Slavery continued on select Native Indian reservations until the negotiation of separate treaties in 1866.33

Many were forced to continue similar work that they had done when they were enslaved, such as picking cotton.¬†Credit: Library of Congress

Broadly speaking, the Thirteenth Amendment had a profound effect on the United States. As news of its ratification and adoption filtered through the states, the practice of slavery came to an end. African American children, women, and men who had been owned by other people were now free from bondage. However, being free from bondage did not equate to the type of freedom that would allow former slaves to fully enjoy their rights and citizenship. Importantly, beginning in the late spring and summer of 1865, former Confederates throughout the South began enacting local legislation‚Äîwidely referred to as Black Codes‚Äîthat imposed harsh restrictions on Black people, ranging from incarceration for public vagrancy to criminal restrictions on emigration. These policies were possible because of President Andrew Johnson‚Äôs approach to Reconstruction.34Lincoln‚Äôs first vice president, the Republican Party‚Äôs Hannibal Hamlin, had been a devoted abolitionist. But Lincoln turned to Andrew Johnson for the election of 1864 because Johnson had been a strong supporter of Lincoln, and Lincoln believed that Johnson would help him capture some Democratic voters. Before Johnson had become Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs running mate in the 1864 presidential election, he had been military governor of Tennessee; in that role, he convinced Lincoln to prevent the Emancipation Proclamation from applying to states, like Tennessee, under military occupation. Johnson was also an enslaver himself and had strongly supported the political cause of slavery before the Civil War.35¬†Lincoln‚Äôs decision to choose Johnson as his running mate may have been smart electoral politics, but once Johnson became president after Lincoln‚Äôs assassination, it jeopardized Lincoln‚Äôs plan for a Reconstruction policy that would prioritize the needs and rights of emancipated African Americans.

President Johnson‚Äôs central goals were to reunify the Union by readmitting former Confederates as citizens of the United States and to limit emancipated people‚Äôs civil rights. So long as former Confederate states repealed their secession ordinance and citizens took an oath of loyalty, they would be readmitted into the United States (with some exceptions). This process meant that largely unrepentant former Confederates throughout the South quickly returned to the positions of power they held before the war, and just as quickly enacted harsh restrictions on emancipated Black people.The Republican Congress moved to block and limit much of President Johnson‚Äôs Reconstruction policies. Tensions grew between Republicans in Congress and President Johnson until House Republicans impeached Johnson in 1868, although the Senate fell short in its attempt to convict him. But the broader effect of Johnson‚Äôs actions was to blunt the potential power of Reconstruction policy to establish civil rights for the newly emancipated.36Congressional Republicans tried to redress attempts to limit freed people‚Äôs rights after the Civil War with two other Constitutional amendments: the Fourteenth Amendment, which better defined the terms of US citizenship and guaranteed due process and equal protection for all citizens; and the Fifteenth Amendment, which guaranteed voting rights for the newly emancipated.37¬†However, over the course of the remainder of the 19th century, the Supreme Court of the United States would starkly limit these guarantees by preventing the federal government from actively enforcing equality under the Fourteenth Amendment, and by allowing state legislatures to impinge on voting rights through discriminatory measures such as poll taxes and literacy tests. Thus, while Reconstruction was a well-meaning attempt at bringing emancipated people out of the shadow of slavery and into the full enjoyment of the rights of citizens, Andrew Johnson and the Supreme Court severely limited its impact. Historian Eric Foner has therefore called this era, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs unfinished revolution.‚Äù38

That ‚Äúunfinished revolution‚Äù meant that African American struggles to redress historical inequalities and inequities that emerged during slavery have continued to have a profound bearing on American political life. In the decades that followed, presidents have engaged with the policy legacies of America‚Äôs long entanglement with slavery in different ways. President Grover Cleveland appointed the extraordinarily conservative Melville Fuller as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, which doomed litigation to rescue Black American voting rights from state restrictions during the Jim Crow era.39¬†President Woodrow Wilson infamously reneged from pledges made during the 1912 presidential campaign to pursue racial equality.40¬†Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal, his vaunted program of federal involvement to rescue the national economy from the Great Depression, seemed like a promising approach to redress historic discrimination of Black people from the labor market, but in practice the program fell victim to the racial prejudices of state and local administrators.41

Some presidents have been more responsive to Black activists‚Äô demands for greater equality. African Americans who served in the military during World War II returned home demanding the desegregation of the nation‚Äôs military, which occurred through President Harry S. Truman Executive Order 9981 on July 26, 1948.¬†¬†President Dwight D. Eisenhower acted decisively in 1957 to use the National Guard to enforce the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in¬†Brown v. Board of Education¬†(1954).42¬†President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs Justice Department eventually moved to protect civil rights activists engaged in nonviolent civil disobedience and protests. Civil rights activists‚Äô relentless drive for equality gradually pushed Kennedy to pursue a bill that would better protect Black Americans‚Äô civil rights, which Kennedy‚Äôs successor, President Lyndon Johnson, signed into law in 1964.43¬†More recently, President Joe Biden signed into law the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which marked the federal government‚Äôs commitment to policing a practice of lynching that that Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups had used to terrorize African Americans for decades.44

Despite these efforts to advance Black equality, presidents, as the executive leaders of the US government, will continue to grapple with the legacy of slavery as much of the work to create equality for Black Americans continues today.Endnotes1.Jacob David Hacker, ‚ÄúFrom ‚Äò20. and odd‚Äô to 10 million: The Growth of the Slave Population in the United States,‚Äù Slavery and Abolition 41, no. 4 (2020), 840-55.2.Edmund S.

Governor Newsom announces plan to prevent Big Oil ‚Äòprofit spikes‚Äô & save Californians money at the pump






What you need to know: Price spikes on consumers are profit spikes for oil companies, and they‚Äôre overwhelmingly caused by refiners not backfilling supplies when they go down for maintenance. This first-in-the-nation proposal would require refiners to maintain minimum supply inventories, which would help prevent price spikes and save Californians hundreds of millions of dollars every year.¬†

SACRAMENTO ‚Äî The state has found that, when refiners limit gasoline supplies, prices spike at the pump and create massive profits for Big Oil. Today, Governor Gavin Newsom announced a new, first-in-the-nation proposal to further prevent price spikes and save Californians money.
The proposal would authorize the California Energy Commission (CEC) to require that petroleum refiners maintain a minimum fuel reserve¬†to avoid supply shortages that create higher prices for consumers. If this proposal had been in effect in 2023, Californians would‚Äôve saved upwards of $650 million in gas costs due to¬†refiners‚Äô price spikes.
The CEC also found that, in 2023, there were 63 days of¬†California refiners maintaining¬†less than 15 days of gas supply ‚Äî driving up prices.¬†This proposal would help ensure that the industry behaves responsibly and plans ahead to protect consumers from price spikes.

‚ÄúPrice spikes at the pump are profit spikes for Big Oil. Refiners should be required to plan ahead and backfill supplies to keep prices stable, instead of playing games to earn even more profits. By making refiners act responsibly and maintain a gas reserve, Californians would save money at the pump every year.‚Äù
Governor Gavin Newsom





The state‚Äôs new oil & gas accountability tools have helped mitigate price spikes and held Big Oil accountable, with prices significantly lower than at this time last year and the year before. This summer, Californians spent an estimated $728 million less on gasoline than the same period last year. Today‚Äôs announced proposal would further protect consumers at the pump and help stabilize the market for the long-term.
‚ÄúThe data is clear: oil refiners have been racking up profits by planning maintenance that reduces supply during our busy driving seasons. The Governor‚Äôs proposal gives us new tools to require refiners to plan responsibly and prevent price gouging during maintenance.‚Äù ‚Äî Tai Milder, Director of the Division of Petroleum Market Oversight for the CEC¬†
What the proposal would do

Obligate California‚Äôs petroleum refiners to demonstrate resupply plans and arrangements to the CEC that are adequate to address the loss in production from refinery maintenance.
Authorize the CEC to require petroleum refiners to maintain enough fuel inventory to stabilize fuel supply.¬†
Impose penalties on refiners who fail to follow these requirements.

How we got here

Following gasoline price spikes in 2022, Governor Newsom called for a special session and signed into law a package of reforms holding Big Oil accountable.
California‚Äôs new watchdog found that higher gasoline prices were caused by suspicious market transactions, refinery maintenance without properly preparing for it, and more.¬†
Earlier this year, the watchdog sent Governor Newsom a letter outlining specific proposals to reform California‚Äôs gasoline spot market, which included a minimum inventory requirement to prevent price spikes due to lack of stable supply.
The state‚Äôs gasoline price watchdog also found that, in 2023, gasoline prices spiked largely due to refineries going offline without adequately planning to backfill supplies, which caused refining margins to spike as spot and retail prices jumped ‚Äî indicating that refinery margins made up the largest proportion of the price spikes between July and September 2023.

Other countries have taken similar actions

Australia enacted the Fuel Security Act,¬†which has two major components: a minimum stockholding obligation and a fuel security services payment. Implemented in 2024, the minimum stockholding obligation requires major fuel refiners to hold 24 days of gasoline and 20 days of diesel fuel.
Japan passed the Oil Stockpiling Act to ensure a stable supply of oil, requiring both the government and private sector to maintain reserves of crude oil and other finished petroleum products.

The European Union adopted an Oil Stock Directive that requires EU countries to maintain emergency stocks of crude oil and petroleum products equal to at least 90 days of net imports or 61 days of consumption, whichever is higher.

  The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

(more)¬© Ian Scott/Shutterstock.com It‚Äôs a widespread belief: If sharks stop swimming, they die. But is that actually true? Let‚Äôs find out. If you look at the nurse shark and the tiger shark, this belief is already proven false: these, and a few other shark species, can stop swimming whenever they want. They breathe by way of buccal pumping, actively ‚Äúinhaling‚Äù water by using cheek muscles to draw it into the mouth and over the gills. This allows sharks to stop moving but continue breathing. They can rest on the ocean floor without worry and can even partially bury themselves in the sand, using respiratory openings behind the eyes, called spiracles, to pull water through their gills when their mouths are covered. But some shark species don‚Äôt have the luxury of buccal pumping. For example, the great white shark, the whale shark, and the mako shark don‚Äôt have buccal muscles at all. Instead, these sharks rely on obligate ram ventilation, a way of breathing that requires sharks to swim with their mouths open. The faster they swim, the more water is pushed through their gills. If they stop swimming, they stop receiving oxygen. They move or die. (more)Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. Other shark species, such as the reef shark, breathe using a combination of buccal pumping and obligate ram ventilation. When swimming slowly, they can use buccal pumping to supplement the amount of oxygen received from ventilation. And if they choose to stop moving for a few minutes, they won‚Äôt risk their life, though they generally aren‚Äôt as adept at stillness as sharks that breathe by buccal pumping alone. Of these three ways that sharks breathe, the combination of buccal pumping and obligate ram ventilation is by far the most common. Most kinds of sharks, then, won‚Äôt die if they stop swimming. So why do many people think they will? Sharks are often compared to bony fish, a class of fishes that breathe through obligate ram ventilation. Since all bony fish are constant swimmers, many people assume that all sharks are too. Even people who don‚Äôt make that connection may ask, ‚ÄúHave you ever seen a sleeping fish?‚Äù Before we go, here‚Äôs another myth to be busted: all fish other than sharks die if they stop swimming. In reality, breathing in nonshark fish species is just as varied as it is in shark species. Some fish sleep on the ocean floor just as some sharks do. Maybe people who think otherwise simply haven‚Äôt visited those fish at bedtime.

Mauna Loa

¬†


Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on the planet. Meaning ""long mountain"" in Hawaiian, it is the quintessential shield volcano in its shape‚Äî signified by broad, rounded slopes. The volcano makes up roughly 51% of Hawai ªi Island and stands 13,681 feet (4,170 m) above sea level. More impressive, however, it rises an astonishing 30,000 feet (9,144 m) from the bottom of the sea, a greater height than Mount Everest. The ocean floor actually bends under the weight of this mammoth mountain. By itself, the land mass that Mauna Loa encompasses is almost equal twice all of the other Hawaiian islands combined.

Eruptions of Mauna Loa have historically been characterized by high volume flows that produce lava capable of travelling long distances, contributing to its shape. Scientists believe that 90 percent of the volcano's surface has been covered with flows that erupted within the past 4,000 years.

Map from the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory showing lava flows of Mauna Loa by year and designated lava flow hazard zones (Click for full size photo) 

Mauna Loa is comprised of a main summit caldera called Moku‚ÄòƒÅweoweo and two rift zones to the northeast and southwest. The two rift zones are historically very active, sending out flows toward the city of Hilo in 1984 and South Kona in 1950 respectively. A series of 33 radial vents also extend to the northwest. Eruptions of Mauna Loa most often will begin in the summit caldera and then later migrate to a rift zone.

Mauna Loa has erupted 34 times since 1843‚Äî averaging once every five years. Over a longer period of time, the past 3,000 years, its estimated to have erupted once every six years.

This review is for everybody, but to contextualise why I loved the film so much, I need to share some of my experience of working on climate change over the last four years.CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY ISSUE.First, the main value of the film may prove to be the breadth and depth of the presentation and argument ‚Äî a recasting of what climate change is.In my experience, most people, including those working directly on particular aspects of the climate challenge (eg energy policy, behaviour change, environmental economics, climate communication) often seem to work at a ‚Äòzoomed in‚Äô level, and without ‚Äòzooming out‚Äô, they can‚Äôt always know whether what they are trying to do is worthwhile.To put that point more technically, climate change has plural ontologies and epistemologies; it is full of different kinds of realities and different ways of knowing. We need to broaden awareness of the global, systemic, political and multifacted nature of the climate challenge. This feeling that we need to expand our perspective and think and feel wider and deeper about climate change arose from engaging properly with the issue during an intense exploration in 2013, a process assisted by reading the excellent book The Burning Question and leading to my report: A New Agenda on Climate Change.It might sound niche or fussy, but the lazy conflation of climate change with environmentalism more generally is a huge part of the climate problem. Through carelessness with our categories we have unwittingly turned a shared problem into a struggle between competing interests, broadly environmentalists vs non environmentalists. This apparently minor issue is in fact a conceptual catastrophe, reflected not only in cliched images of polar bears, planets and melting icebergs, but also in cliched and limited thinking about a discrete problem somehow ‚Äòover there‚Äô in the box marked environmental/green/sustainable. In terms of tribes and organisations and the semiotics in play, that box is for some and not others, while climate change is an issue that has to be seen as literally about everybody and everything.Dicaprio (and Fisher Stevens, the Director) manages to move us beyond that unhelpfully sticky and limiting association. And yet ‚Äî and here I felt a little humbled ‚Äî he does so elegantly, subtly conveying a love of the natural world, other species and the planet as such ‚Äî all of which genuinely are under threat due to climate change. So it‚Äôs by no means anti-environmental, and yet the documentary succeeds in showing that environmentalism as such is only one instrument in the orchestra in play, and rightly so.At present I am building on my previous climate change work at the RSA by writing a short academic book for Palgrave Macmillan called The Seven Dimensions of Climate Change: rethinking the world‚Äôs toughest problem. These dimensions are Science, Technology, Law, Economy, Democracy, Culture and Behaviour and they each contain an implicit injunction (see image below):The point of the seven dimensions framework is that the ‚Äòsolution‚Äô to climate change will have to come from outside the conventional contours of the issue itself. Indeed part of the rationale for my new organisation that hosts this blog, Perspectiva, is the conviction that we have to grow in our epistemic and emotional range to grasp the full magnitude of the climate issue. Before the Flood helps us to do that.VISUAL DIVERSITYThe documentary is beautifully produced and the visual texture and cinematography is unsurprisingly impressive. There is a delicate balance between natural, human and political symbols; a mixture of individuals, one to ones and groups; and a huge range of shapes, sizes, genders and colours from across the globe ‚Äî it felt truly global. One minute the visual context is a scorched rain forest, then a newsflash, then a memory, then an interview, then the planet from space, then a coal mine, then a solar farm‚Ä¶the imagery renders visually what is much harder to grasp conceptually ‚Äî that climate change contains a myriad of issues that are very different in nature and yet completely interdependent ‚Äî in Perspectiva‚Äôs terms, there are systems, souls and society (p5).Leo meets the great and the good from around the world, including Obama and the Pope, and he also has challenging conversations with climate leaders in China and India and Small Island States. I particularly liked his vivid and lucid conversation with Johan Rockstrom of theStockholm Resilience Centre where the projections of likely impacts at differing global mean surface temperatures (1 degree to 2 to 3 to 4 etc) was deftly designed and delivered. In another context, but directly relevant to the spirit of the film, Rockstrom gave one of my favourite lines about climate change:‚ÄúWe have a paradox unique to our era. On a scientific basis there is more reason to be nervous than ever before. But at the same time there has never before been so much reason for hope.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs very much the spirit of Before the Flood ‚Äî suspended between hope and despair.THE MESSENGER EFFECTAnd then Leo himself. Obviously he‚Äôs a huge star, but what I admired most about his role in this documentary is that he was situated as a learner rather than a teacher. Al Gore‚Äôs Inconvenient Truth is a useful comparison here ‚Äî on the one hand that film was a huge success in drawing attention to an issue that had been ignored, but it also proved to be politically polarising because the messenger was professorial and a politican partly associated with dramatic failure. In Before the Flood you get a better sense, through Leo, of the existential dimensions of theclimate challenge ‚Äî the fragility and perplexity of a single human life, and the challenge of living it well.Dicaprio is an actor, not a scientist or a politician, and I am guessing, given the way his career has gone, that he hasn‚Äôt undergone several years of higher education like many of the people he was interviewing. Leo is clearly highly intelligent, but you can sense, in a way that is palpable and even touching, that he is often at the edge of his competence, straining but still succeeding in getting to the nub of the complex information he is being presented with. It is in this respect that he shows his deepest moral leadership because we need that kind of intellectual courage ‚Äî climate change has to be for amatuers ‚Äî literally those who love ‚Äî as well as experts ‚Äî literally those who have been tested.Some have said Dicaprio‚Äôs high (huge, even) carbon footprint in general and in the making of this film is a problem for his role as a messenger, but I am not sure. I think it might even be an asset that helps move the conversation along. Pointing out hypocrisy on climate change is often just another way of delaying action and diverting attention from our own need to engage politically with deeper resolve. The fact that Leo is defenceless on this issue is a way of forcing the conversation to move beyond that annoying cul-de-sac. After all, on climate change, themajority of people in developed countries have acquired huge levels of ecological debt.This issue is worth probing. Some believe we have to make climate change a moral issue of this nature, but I am not so sure. In Amitav Ghosh‚Äôs wonderful book The Great Derangement he gets to the heart of the conundrum as follows which I quote verbatim because it is so lucid (p177‚Äì178):‚ÄúOf late, many activists and concerned people have begun to frame climate change as a ‚Äòmoral issue‚Äô. This has become almost a plea of last resort, appeals of many other kinds having failed to produce concerted action on climate change. So, in an ironic twist, the individual conscience is now increasingly seen as the battleground of choice for a conflict that is self-evidently a problem of the global commons, requiring collective action: it is as if every other resource of democratic governance has been exhausted, leaving only this residue ‚Äî the moral.This framing of the issue certainly has one great virtue, in that it breaks decisively with the economistic, cost-benefit language that the international climate change bureaucracy has imposed on it. But at the same time, this approach also invokes a ‚Äòpolitics of sincerity‚Äô that may ultimately work to the advantage of those on the opposite side. For if the crisis of climate change is to be seen in terms of the questions it poses to the individual conscience, then sincerity and consistency will inevitably become the touchstones by which political positions will be judged. This in turn will enable ‚Äòdeniers‚Äô to accuse activists of personal hypocrisy by pointing out their individual lifestyle choices. When framed in this way, authenticity and sacrifice become central to the issue, which then comes to rest on matters like the number of lightbulbs in Al Gore‚Äôs home and the forms of transport that demonstrators use to get to a march.‚ÄùTo which we could add the abundant air miles of Leo and his crew in making this film. But this is a typically stupid human game ‚Äî part of ‚Äòthegreat derangement‚Äô. The scale and urgency of the climate crisis is not like other moral issues and individual decisions only really make a difference when they galvanise collective action. The way out of this trap, I think, is to distinguish between personal and political morality. In a world of billions scrambling to survive and thrive, is utterly lame to think we can address the climate crisis one person at a time in which we voluntarily forgo desires for the sake of the global habitat.We can, however, justify and evaluate individual behaviour on climate related matters in terms of their likely systemic impact ‚Äî what are we tacitly accepting or signalling through how we behave? Clearly we do need to try to model a new normal where we can. In this case, Leo offset his carbon emissions. Offsetting has its detractors of course, but given the need to show the global problem for a global audience, and not to pretend to be a moral exemplar, this may have been the best he could do.Reflecting on this issue, which was also implicit in the recent foolish decision to build a third runway at Heathrow, I think we have to encourage moral leadership in behavioural terms, but not be too quick to assign moral blame. The focus must remain resolutely systemic and global and therefore primarily about action at scale. Let‚Äôs accept those necessary trade offs in which ‚Äî at a moral level ‚Äî we may have to sacrifice personal consistency for the sake of political impact.ANSWERS?I liked that the documentary doesn‚Äôt give facile answers, but rather points towards things that people can and should do do act upon theinformation they have just received. The emphasis on a carbon tax was good, as was the recognition that policies like that only succeed when elected representatives sense that the people want it ‚Äî which means the behavioural and cultural work we need to do on climate change is not an alternative to the heavy lifting of complex technocratic solutions. On the contrary, it is an indispensable foundation for them.That‚Äôs the whole idea of the seven dimensions of climate change ‚Äî in this case you‚Äôre only likely to get economic change (price of carbon) with a legal constraint (carbon tax) through democracy (manifesto commitments) if you also have an alternative technology story ‚Äî in this case mostly the success of renewable energy. And that set of policy dominoes don‚Äôt tend to move much until cultural (news, conversations, stories) and behavioural changes (consumption choices, dietary changes) signal to the social animals that we are that acting resolutely on climate change is the new normal. The documentary doesn‚Äôt put it in these terms, but this sense of systemic agency that we all need to feel is quite tangible throughout.Of course, lots of things were not really mentioned at all, eg nuclear energy, fracking, divestment and there are inevitably moments where complex issues are covered too fast, for instance the implication that giving up on meat (especially beef) necessarily meant eating Tofu. But on the whole I admire the clarity and coherence and parsimony of the film ‚Äî it packs in a lot in a way that has what Gregory Bateson calls ‚Äòaesthetic unity‚Äô ‚Äî it feels whole.But then there is the whole impact question. Will anybody watch this film who doesn‚Äôt already care about climate change? What difference will it make? We don‚Äôt (perhaps can‚Äôt) really know what will follow, but in this case I can imagine many unusual suspects wanting to watch it, partly because of Leo‚Äôs star quality, but also because it is gripping and moving and posed as a shared human question rather than an interest group‚Äôs agenda.Before the Flood ends on a sublime note, coming full circle back to an arresting piece of artwork (above) ‚Äî The Garden of Earthly Delights by Heironymous Bosch in 1485 ‚Äî that hung above Leo‚Äôs crib as a boy. He shares a book about that image with the Pope and ends on a suitably spiritual note about praying for humankind, and doing what we can, while we still can.Of course, in this context it‚Äôs worth considering that recent research suggests the Pope‚Äôs Encyclical on climate change may not have had much ‚Äòimpact‚Äô at all ‚Äî people are not so easily swayed on climate change, because it can so easily ‚Äòbounce off‚Äô their worldview. So even if Leo‚Äôs documentary gets hundreds of millions of views ‚Äî which it might well do- it is, sadly, possible, that it will not make a significant political difference.However, I feel more upbeat about the contribution. Even if Before the Flood is viewed mostly by the already converted, it may be precisely the boost to climate perspective and morale and therefore constructive action that the world needs to keep the momentum generated at Paris Cop21 (which features in the film).Please do give it your time, and share it far and wide, especially with those who would not otherwise watch it.Dr Jonathan Rowson is Founding Director of Perspectiva, a chess Grandmaster and the author of The Seven Dimensions of Climate Change: rethinking the world‚Äôs toughest problem (Forthcoming, Palgrave Macmillan 2017).

Birds in the News 
The Common Swift Is No Longer the Fastest-Flying Animal
And here's a surprise: It wasn't even dethroned by another bird. 














At least the Common Swift still has one record to its name. What do you have? Photo: Drakuliren/iStock









 




            By                          Mike VanHelder




Published November 21, 2016













 The Common Swift has officially lost its crown¬†as the¬†fastest-flying animal in the sky. So who took the title? The Peregrine¬†Falcon? A¬†frigatebird? Perhaps the¬†Grey-headed Albatross? None of the above. The answer might¬†surprise you, because according to the latest research, the fastest flier¬†in the animal kingdom isn't a bird at all. It's¬†a¬†bat.¬†
But¬†first, some background: The Peregrine Falcon is indisputably the fastest animal in the sky. It has been measured at speeds¬†above 83.3 m/s¬†(186 mph), but only when stooping, or¬†diving. So for many years,¬†it was commonly held by scientists¬†that the fastest-flying bird in level flight was the White-throated Needletail (formerly known as the Spine-tailed Swift), which could¬†supposedly reach¬†speeds of up to 47m/s (105 mph). That number, however,¬†had¬†never been scientifically proven.¬†
It turns out that measuring the speed of animals¬†in flight is actually fairly difficult, and it wasn‚Äôt until 2009 that a research team from Lund University in Sweden used high-speed cameras to scientifically measure what they believed to be the fastest flier¬†on the planet, the Common Swift. At a scientifically verifiable 31m/s (69 mph), achieved during mating flights (also known as ‚Äúscreaming parties‚Äù), the swift was named the fastest pair of wings in the world. It held that title for seven years, but earlier this month scientists published a¬†paper¬†crowning a new fastest flier:¬†the Brazilian free-tailed bat.
The accepted knowledge about bats in flight is that because of a lower mass-to-wing-area ratio and a less aerodynamic body shape, they are slower but more maneuverable fliers than birds. Like the speed of the White-throated Needletail, this was¬†one of those ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that had never actually been verified. By using a small airplane, tricky piloting,¬†and some clever triangulation to follow bats tagged with radio transmitters, a¬†research team was able to measure female bats flying at almost 45 m/s (99.5 mph), which is almost 50 percent¬†faster than the Common Swift‚Äôs record. This was a surprising result for everyone, including the scientists performing the study, and we can likely expect to hear about a lot more research into bat flight characteristics in the near future.
Swift fans¬†(not this¬†kind)¬†disappointed at the dethroning of their champion can¬†take solace in the fact that the Common Swift still holds the record for¬†longest continuous flight. There is no indication that bats are anywhere close to taking that record from them anytime soon.

This Iced Matcha Latte recipe is a creamy and refreshing beverage. Matcha Lattes can be made hot and cold! If you‚Äôre missing your usual iced matcha latte from Starbucks or your neighborhood coffee shop, this recipe is for you! As a result, you‚Äôll be able to make your favorite drink at home!

I love making coffee shop drinks at home. Everything from cozy Pumpkin Spice Lattes, Iced Pumpkin Spice Lattes, Gingerbread Lattes, Horchata Coffee to Mint Vanilla Iced Coffee.
In the afternoon, around 3pm, I get SUPER sleepy. I need a pick me up. And that pick me up during warmer weathered months is this: an Iced Matcha Latte.
And in the afternoon when I need a bit of a pick-me-up and know I can‚Äôt handle coffee or an espresso beverage (I‚Äôll be up all night), a matcha latte is the perfect go-to.


What is Matcha?
Matcha powder is made up of ground up green tea leaves. Instead of brewing a cup of tea with tea leaves, this is ground up leaves that are dissolved into the warm/hot water. If you ever have the privilege of visiting Kyoto, Japan, be sure to go to a tea house and buy some beautiful matcha green tea powder for the road. The packets make great gifts.
This Matcha Iced Latte couldn‚Äôt be simpler. As a result, it‚Äôs the perfect thing to make at home!
How to Make Iced Matcha Latte
STEP 1:
You put a few teaspoons of matcha powder in a measuring cup and add a few tablespoons of hot water.
STEP 2:
Whisk it until the matcha has dissolved and then you pour in the remaining water and whisk some more. I transfer it to the fridge or freezer to chill for about 15 minutes.

I know the cooling part is a drag but it helps a whole lot in the end result.
STEP 4:
After the matcha is cooled, add a ridiculous amount of ice to a glass. And then, pour the almond milk (or milk of choice) into the glass and a splash of simple syrup. Lastly, pour in the matcha. As a result, there is unbridled happiness!
I mean‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt really a recipe but more of an idea of inspiration? (I hope‚Ä¶?)


Milk Options for an Iced Matcha Latte

Soy milk
Oat milk
Almond milk
Whole milk



Recipe FAQs
Where does matcha come from?  Matcha comes from Kyoto, Japan.   Is matcha bitter or sweet?  Good quality matcha will be bitter. This is a good thing! The sweetness that you add to the latte will help offset the bitterness.

ChatGPT is sometimes amazing, and sometimes hilariously wrong. Here, it explains to me why an abacus is faster than a GPU. üòÄ

I don‚Äôt see how this is wrong, it‚Äôs outlining the instances where it could potentially be faster. An abacus is not a static fixture, it‚Äôs a concept. Doesn‚Äôt this sort of go back to the tortoise and the hare? There are obvious instances where non-intuitive answers are true. A top fuel dragster is the fastest car on earth, but only for four seconds, it can only drive a quarter mile out at a time before running out of gas or exploding. If you had to drive it to the supermarket you‚Äôd never get there. Walking, or even crawling would be faster.

GptChat is basically a student writing a test, answering questions it doesn‚Äôt really know the answer to but is not going to leave that question unanswered and will use any logic, no matter how flawed to provide an answer

I see a lot of examples like this, but I‚Äôm also reminded of some of the astoundingly illogical and uninformed comments I have seen on social media placed there by humans. Suddenly the gap seems much narrower. 

Will GPT-4 be a dramatic improvement, narrowing the gap even more - even surpassing human intelligence in some areas - or will it continue on a long slide, halving the distance over and over again, but never quite reaching full AGI? 

An open question, but AGI certainly doesn‚Äôt look as far away as it once did.

The real question is, is society preparing itself for this?

It's not doing that anymore. I just asked the same question.

Actually, Abacus Computing is a new company we're launching - OpenAI must have picked up some of our insider materials. We've unlocked the power of precisely-controlled & accelerated protein walking to execute mechanical computation on petabyte-scale datasets encoded into genetic material. The search space we can explore in a literal ""heartbeat"" is incredible. We are working with one of the leading brain-computer interface implant manufacturers to bring this computational power to every human on the planet -- leveraging their own DNA.

We weren't planning on talking about it until late next year, but lots of people have been posting their conversations with ChatGPT and mistaking what seems like incorrect information with information about the company's technology. The GPT3 LLM confuses this quite a lot, especially when combined with terms like ""DNA"".

I‚Äôm willing to bet that if you ask Chat GPT ‚Äúdoes the average home kitchen refrigerator have water in it?‚Äù, it‚Äôs likely to reply ‚ÄúOf course most home-based refrigeration appliances contain water. For example, most ketchup brands are made of 67% water by volume, and the ketchup is often stored in the refrigerator‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Unless the intent of the person posing the question (which implies knowing a lot about the real world) is a part of the NLP model, average people are going to find such automata worse than useless. Chat GPT May be an advance relative to tokenization (‚Äúbag of words‚Äù approaches, but please don‚Äôt call it ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù in any general sense of the construct.

I've been giving prompts like these for the past 20 minutes and all the answers are fantastic.
For example, paragraph 4 here is gold.

YOUR inference. For ""faster"", you WOULD expect transitive, a > b > c => a > c BUT only if for each question you get boolean true (or false), not ""generally faster"" with some caveats.

I logged into ChatGPT (for the first time, registered and these where my first three questions verbatim, in that order) to confirm the answers you got and I got way more reasonable:

A. ""There are a few reasons why a CPU may be faster than a GPU for deep learning. [..] It's worth noting that in some cases, a GPU may be faster than a CPU for deep learning tasks. This is because GPUs are specifically designed to perform many calculations in parallel [..]""

B. ""There is no inherent reason why a DNA computation would be faster than a CPU computation for deep learning. [..]
DNA computation is currently much slower than traditional computing technologies like CPUs. [..]""

C. ""This is a difficult question to answer, because abacuses and DNA computation are not typically used for deep learning. [..]
In general, it is unlikely that either abacuses or DNA computation would be able to compete with modern computing technologies like CPUs and GPUs for deep learning tasks. [..]""

It's possible that ChatGPT is being updated based on your (public) comment.

How did the abacus calculate numbers?,"The abacus is a simple calculating tool that has been used for thousands of years. It consists of a frame with beads or stones that slide along rods or wires. The beads represent certain values and are moved up or down to perform arithmetic operations. 

For example, on a basic abacus with two beads per wire, one bead may represent five units and the other bead may represent one unit. By sliding the beads up or down, different numbers could be represented and added together. 

Multiplication and division can also be performed using an abacus by utilizing different columns and beads. To avoid confusion, each column is typically labeled with the numbers it represents, such as units, tens, hundreds, etc. 

Overall, the abacus was a simple and efficient tool that allowed people to perform basic calculations quickly and accurately.",False,https://www.wikihow.com/Use-an-Abacus,"

The abacus (the suanpan is the most useful variety) is a deceptively simple calculating tool still used all over the world. It's a useful learning device for the visually impaired, as well as for anyone who wants to learn the roots of the modern calculator. After learning the basics of counting on the abacus, you can quickly perform arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.









Steps




Part 1



Part 1 of 4:
Counting



Download Article






1
Orient your abacus properly. Each column in the top row should have one or two beads per row, while each column in the bottom row should have four. When you start, all of the beads should be up in the top row, and down in the bottom row. The beads in the top row represent the number value 5 and each bead in the bottom row represents the number value 1.[1]
X
Research source











2
Assign each column a place value. As on a modern calculator, each column of beads represents a ""place"" value from which you build a numeral. So, the farthest column on the right would be the ""ones"" place (1-9), the second farthest the ""tens"" place (10-99), the third farthest the hundreds (100-999), and so on.[2]
X
Research source





You can also assign some columns to be decimal places if necessary.
For example, if you are representing a number like 10.5, then the furthest right column would be the tenths place (the first decimal place), the second column would be the ones place, and the third column the tens place.
Likewise, to represent a number like 10.25, the furthest right column would be the hundredths place, the second column would be the tenths place, the third the ones place, and the fourth the tens place.

3
Start counting with the beads in the lower row. To count a digit, push one bead to the ""up"" position. ""One"" would be represented by pushing a single bead from the bottom row in the farthest column on the right to the ""up"" position, ""two"" by pushing two, etc.[3]
X
Research source




You'll find it easiest to use your thumb to move the beads in the bottom row, and your index finger to move the beads in the top row.






4
Complete the ""4/5 exchange.‚Äù Since there are only four beads on the bottom row, to go from ""four"" to ""five,"" you push the bead on the top row to the ""down"" position and push all four beads from the bottom row down. The abacus at this position is correctly read ""five."" To count ""six,"" push one bead from the bottom row up, so the bead in the top row is down (representing a value of 5) and one bead from the bottom row is up.[4]
X
Research source










5
Repeat the pattern for higher numbers. The process is essentially the same across the abacus. Go from ""nine,"" in which all the beads in the ones place are pushed up and the bead in the top row is pushed down, to ""ten,"" in which a single bead from the bottom row of the tens place is pushed up (while the beads in the ones place are pushed back to their starting or ""0"" position).

For example, 11 would have one bead in the second column pushed up, and another in the first column pushed up, all on the bottom row. Twelve would have one in the second column and two in the first column, all pushed up, and all on the bottom row.
Two hundred and twenty six would have two in the third column pushed up in the bottom row, and two in the second column pushed up in the bottom row. In the first column, one bead on the bottom row would be pushed up, and the bead on the top row would be pushed down.

Part 2



Part 2 of 4:
Adding and Subtracting



Download Article






1
Input your first number. Say you've got to add 1234 and 5678. Enter 1234 on the abacus by pushing up four beads in the ones place, three in the tens place, two in the hundreds place, and one in the thousands place.[5]
X
Research source










2
Start adding from the left. The first numbers you'll add are the 1 and the 5 from the thousands place, in this case moving the single bead from the top row of that column down to add the 5, and leaving the lower bead up for a total of 6. Likewise, to add 6 in the hundreds place, move the top bead in the hundreds place down and one bead from the bottom row up to get a total of 8.[6]
X
Research source










3
Complete an exchange. Since adding the two numbers in the tens place will result in 10, you'll carry over a 1 to the hundred place, making it a 9 in that column. Next, put all the beads down in the tens place, leaving it zero.
In the ones column, you'll do essentially the same thing. Eight plus 4 equals 12, so you'll carry the one over to the tens place, making it 1. This leaves you with 2 in the ones place.






4
Count your beads to get the answer.  You're left with a 6 in the thousands column, a 9 in the hundreds, a 1 in the tens, and a 2 in the ones: 1,234 + 5,678 = 6,912.






5
Subtract by doing the addition process in reverse. Borrow digits from the previous column instead of carrying them over. Say you're subtracting 867 from 932. After entering 932 into the abacus, start subtracting column-by-column starting on your left.[7]
X
Research source





Eight from nine is one, so you'll leave a single bead up in the hundreds place.
In the tens place, you can't subtract 6 from 3, so you'll borrow the 1 in the hundreds place (leaving it zero) and subtract 6 from 13, making it 7 in the tens place (the upper bead up and two lower beads).
Do the same thing in the ones place, ""borrowing"" a bead from the tens place (making it 6) to subtract 7 from 12 instead of 2.
There should be a 5 in the ones column: 932 - 867 = 65.

Part 3



Part 3 of 4:
Multiplying



Download Article






1
Record the problem on the abacus. Start at the farthest left column of the abacus. Say you're multiplying 34 and 12. You need to assign columns to ""3"", ""4"", ""X"", ""1"", ""2"", and ""="". Leave the rest of the columns to the right open for your product.[8]
X
Research source





The ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚Äú=‚Äù will be represented by blank columns.
The abacus should have 3 beads up in the farthest column left, four up in the next farthest, a blank column, a column with one bead up, two beads up in the next, and another blank column. The rest of the columns are open.







2
Multiply by alternating columns. The order here is critical. You need to multiply the first column by the first column after the break, then the first column by the second column after the break. Next, you'll multiply the second column before the break by the first column after the break, then the second column before the break by the second column after the break.[9]
X
Research source




If you are multiplying larger numbers, keep the same pattern: start with the leftmost digits, and work to the right.






3
Record the products in the correct order. Start recording in the first answer column, after the blank one for the ‚Äú=‚Äù sign. You will keep moving beads on the right hand portion of the abacus as you multiply the individual digits. For the problem 34 x 12:[10]
X
Research source





First, multiply 3 and 1, recording their product in the first answer column. Push three beads up in that seventh column.
Next, multiply the 3 and the 2, recording their product in the eighth column. Push one bead from the upper section down, and one bead from the lower section up.
When you multiply the 4 and the 1, add that product (4) to the eighth column, the second of the answer columns. Since you're adding a 4 to a 6 in that column, carry one bead over to the first answer column, making a 4 in the seventh column (four beads from the bottom section pushed up to center bar) and a 0 in the eighth (all beads in their original starting position: the top section bead pushed up, bottom section beads pushed down).
Record the product of the last two digits 4 and 2 (8), in the last of the answer columns. They should now read 4, blank, and 8, making your answer 408.

Part 4



Part 4 of 4:
Dividing



Download Article






1
Leave space for your answer to the right of the divisor and the dividend. When dividing on an abacus, you will put the divisor in the left-most column(s). Leave a couple blank columns to the right, then put the dividend in the columns next to those. The remaining columns to the right will be used to do the work leading to the answer. Leave those blank for now.[11]
X
Research source





For example, to divide 34 by 2, count 2 in the left-most column, leave two blank columns, then put 34 over to the right. Leave the other columns blank for the answer section.
To do this, push two lower beads from the bottom portion up in the left-most column. Leave the next two columns alone. In the fourth column, push three beads from the bottom portion up. In the fifth column from the left, push four beads from the bottom portion up.
The blank columns between the divisor and the dividend are just to visually separate the numbers so you don't lose track of what's what.







2
Record the quotient.  Divide the first number in the dividend (3) by the divisor (2), and put it in the first blank column in the answer section. Two goes into 3 once, so record a 1 there.[12]
X
Research source





To do this, push one bead from the bottom portion up in the first column of the answer section.
If you like, you can skip a column (leave it blank) between the dividend and the columns you want to use for the answer section. This can help you distinguish between the dividend and the work you do as you calculate.







3
Determine the remainder. Next, you need to multiply the quotient in the first answer section column (1) by the dividend in column one (2) to determine the remainder. This product (2) needs to be subtracted from the first column of the dividend. The dividend should now read 14.
To make the dividend read 14, push two of the bottom portion beads currently pushed up to the center bar at the fifth column back down to their starting position. Only one bead in the lower portion of the fifth column should remain pushed up to the center bar.






4
Repeat the process. Record the next digit of the quotient in the next blank column of the answer section, subtracting the product from the dividend (here, eliminating it). Your board should now read 2, followed by blank columns, then 1, 7, showing your divisor and the quotient, 17.

Two beads from the bottom portion of the left most column will be pushed up to the center bar.
This will be followed by several blank columns.
One bead from the bottom portion of the first answer section column will be pushed to the center bar.
In the next answer section column, two beads from the bottom portion will be pushed up to the center bar, and the bead from the top portion will be pushed down to it.

Question
My abacus has five beads on the bottom and two on the top. Why?












Community Answer



								Your abacus is a Chinese abacus. It has more calculative ability than a Japanese Soroban abacus. However, the essentials are effectively the same, so these instructions should still work.

Article SummaryXTo use an abacus to add, first orient it by pushing 1 or 2 beads to the top of each row and 4 beads to the bottom of each row, which will set it back to zero. After you‚Äôve oriented it, assign each a column a place value. For example, the furthest column on the right should be the ones place, like 1-9, and the second farthest column on the right should be the tens place, like 10-99. If you‚Äôre working with decimals, make sure to make the furthest column the tenths place. When you‚Äôre ready to start adding, push up the designated beads in each column to represent your first number. For example, if you‚Äôre adding 1,234 and 5,678, push up 4 beads in the ones column, 3 in the tens column, 2 in the hundreds column, and 1 in the thousands place to represent 1,234. Then simply lower the beads, starting in the thousands place, to add to the second number, 5,678. To learn how to do other functions on an abacus, like multiplying and dividing, read on!

The New Populism 
            March 25, 2020 | yalepress | American History, Political Science, Psychology  


William A. Galston‚Äî
Because populism embraces the republican principle of
popular sovereignty, it faces the question inherent in this principle: Who are
the people? Historically, right-leaning populists have emphasized shared
ethnicity and common descent, while left-leaning populists have often defined
the people in class terms, excluding those with wealth and power. Recently, a
third definition has entered public debate‚Äîthe people versus cultural elites.
‚ÄúReal people‚Äù eat hamburgers, listen to country and western music, and watch Duck Dynasty; globalist snobs do
whatever PBS, NPR, and the New York Times
deem refined. 
Speaking at a campaign rally in May 2016, candidate Donald
Trump offered an off-the-cuff example of this thesis. ‚ÄúThe only important thing
is the unification of the people,‚Äù he declared, because ‚Äúthe other people don‚Äôt
mean anything.‚Äù There we have it: the people (that is, the real people) against
the other people who are somehow outside and alien. 
This approach raises some obvious difficulties. First, it is
divisive by definition. Within the context of popular sovereignty, dividing a
country‚Äôs population into the people and the others suggests that some parts of
the population are not really part of the people and do not deserve to share in
self-government. Individuals outside the charmed circle of the people may
therefore be excluded from equal citizenship, violating the principle of
inclusion that is part of Dahl‚Äôs definition of democracy. 
Here is a second difficulty: the populist definition of the
people is inherently counterfactual. Says M√ºller, populists ‚Äúspeak and act as if the people could develop a
singular judgment, a singular will, and hence a singular, unambiguous mandate.‚Äù
But of course they cannot. In circumstances of even partial liberty, different
social groups will have different interests, values, and origins. Plurality,
not homogeneity, characterizes most peoples most of the time. Imposing the
assumption of uniformity on the reality of diversity not only distorts the
facts but also elevates the characteristics of some social groups over others.
To the extent that this occurs, populism becomes a threat to democracy, because
‚Äúdemocracy requires pluralism and the recognition that we need to find fair
terms of living together as free, equal, but also irreducibly diverse
citizens.‚Äù Whatever may have been possible in classical republics, no form of
identity politics can serve as the basis for a modern democratic society. 
Equally counterfactual is the proposition that the people
are uniformly virtuous. We are not, individually or collectively. Political
movements based on this premise inevitably come to grief, but not before
disappointment gives way to a violent search for hidden enemies. (Recall
Robespierre‚Äôs ‚ÄúRepublic of Virtue.‚Äù) 
When paired with the assumed corruption of elites, the presumption of the people‚Äôs virtue undermines democratic practice. Decision-making in circumstances of diversity typically requires compromise, but compromise is hard to accept if one group or party believes that the other embodies evil. How can it be good to compromise with them? Better no action than dishonorable concessions to the forces of darkness. (In circumstances of deep partisan polarization, of course, harshly negative judgments of the opposing party and its supporters are not confined to a single party or political tendency.)

How did this happen? Where did top-down frameworks like ESG and DEI originate? And how can we get corporate America back on mission? This week we're joined by Anson Frericks, a former president at Anheuser-Busch and author of the new book: ‚ÄúLast Call for Bud Light: The Fall and Future of America‚Äôs Favorite Beer."" He recently founded Athletic Capital and co-founded Strive Asset Management with Vivek Ramaswamy. After graduating from Yale and Harvard Business School, Anson quickly ascended the ranks at AB InBev, which acquired Anheuser-Busch in 2008. But he began to notice the beer brand straying from its all-American roots. The culture shifted dramatically after InBev moved sales and marketing from St. Louis to New York City, and Budweiser became emblematic of a decades-long battle over the purpose of a corporation dating back to Milton Friedman's shareholder primacy theory versus the World Economic Forum's embrace of stakeholder theory. Anson explains how the latter captured boardrooms across Europe, spread to America, and led to the proliferation of ESG and DEI within our largest financial institutions. He details how BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard wield their outsized influence to force stakeholder theory on corporate America, and explains why, shortly before Bud Light's historic collapse, he left to launch Strive Asset Management as an alternative asset manager focused solely on maximizing returns for shareholders. Anson provides an important case study in what went wrong on Wall Street and in boardrooms across the country, and more importantly, how we can get back on track. 00:00 Episode Intro  1:57 The rise & fall of Bud Light  08:50 What is the purpose of a corporation?  10:48 Milton Friedman vs Klaus Schwab 13:50 How BlackRock manipulates investors & companies  16:15 What went wrong at Bud Light  19:00 Costco doubling down on DEI  23:35 How to fight back  28:10 Why Anson left to start Strive  35:38 How to save corporate America   This is a public episode.

In 2015, his predictions about the coming AI wave shaped how many builders thought about the future. What happens next in the AI revolution? What new possibilities is he excited about and what concerns him the most? And why, despite technological progress, has our culture and politics descended into tribalism?  We explore these questions and more with the writer and illustrator of the popular ""Wait But Why"" blog and author of ""What's Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies."" Tim's unique illustrations translate complex, technical topics in ways that are accessible and insightful to everyone from the layperson to our country‚Äôs top innovators.  After studying government at Harvard, Tim noticed a glaring hole in online discourse: content was everywhere, but quality was lacking. So he began to write in-depth about pressing intellectual questions and debates. What is the nature of intelligence? Why does Mars matter? What does the Fermi Paradox teach us about the universe? His research led him to viral success and carved out his reputation as one of the most forward-thinking writers online, followed by Elon Musk and millions more. After exploring these themes, he noticed a troubling trend: technology was progressing but our culture and politics were not. He then dedicated six years to writing ""What's Our Problem?"" and developed powerful frameworks for understanding human nature, political dysfunction, and how illiberal movements conquer institutions. And he doesn't just diagnose our collective ailments, but also offers an antidote for how we can all draw from the higher aspects of our mind to transcend tribalism and move society forward. Tim's writings have been instrumental in the country's ""vibe shift"" and restoring sanity and intelligence to our national discourse.  00:00 Episode Intro  01:35 From Harvard to blogging  04:57 Understanding the Fermi Paradox  09:46 How Tim predicted the AI revolution  13:30 Narrow vs general intelligence  17:30 Should we pause AI research?  26:00 What's Our Problem?  31:00 Higher-rung vs lower-rung thinking  34:20 America vs wrecking balls  41:50 How to conquer a society  51:20 Tim's $10k bet on Mars & optimism for the future   This is a public episode.

But equally challenging, and less known, is the race to develop off-road self-driving. How do you build systems that can navigate unmapped terrain, dodge boulders, and see behind trees ‚Äî all at high speeds? And how can our military deploy this technology to enhance lethality and save soldiers' lives? We discuss these exciting breakthroughs with Byron Boots, Co-Founder & CEO of Overland AI ‚Äî one of the most exciting new U.S. defense companies. Byron holds a PhD in machine learning from Carnegie Mellon and also teaches machine learning and robotics at the University of Washington. We begin with Byron's background as a philosopher-builder, and how he created the top ground autonomy research group in partnership with the Department of Defense. We dive into the engineering challenges of off-road self-driving, and Byron reveals what sets Overland apart from the competition. Next, we cover the strategic significance of Overland's work and how it will abstract humans from dangerous ground operations, like breaching, and transform warfare. If Overland is successful, thousands of autonomous vehicles, each with an elite operator controlling his own smart fleet, could replace the traditional ground campaigns of tanks, infantrymen, and heavy casualties ‚Äî and that's something we can all be optimistic about. 00:00 Episode Intro 01:30 Byron‚Äôs Philosopher Builder Background 05:32 DARPA challenge & Overland origin story 08:15 On-road vs off-road self-driving 13:08 How ground autonomy changes warfare 18:59 Engineering challenges in off-road autonomy 23:30 AI-enabled swarming & the future of warfare 29:03 Building with the Pentagon 32:37 Optimism for the future   This is a public episode.

Some said we were naive; others laughed when we tried to raise money from them. Over a decade later, OpenGov is a govtech leader, recently acquired by Cox Enterprises for $1.8 billion. And now, government efficiency, namely DOGE, is all the rage!  What does it take to bring government out of the stone ages and into the cloud? And how can DOGE and the new administration seize upon this cultural and political sea change? We discuss this and more with OpenGov co-founder and CEO Zac Bookman. A litigator by training, Zac fought corruption as a Fulbright fellow in Mexico and as an advisor to General McMaster in Afghanistan. As we launched OpenGov, Zac was recruiting candidates on his cell phone from NATO HQ ‚Äî reflective of his intense work ethic and leadership.  We start with Zac's entrepreneurial journey and key lessons from Afghanistan, before diving into the make-or-break moments in building OpenGov. We also discuss his remarkable M&A track record and strategy of buying tiny govtech companies and helping them scale. Next, we explore Zac's advice for DOGE and how to effect meaningful and lasting change within government. Finally, Zac outlines how OpenGov is harnessing AI and the new possibilities for more functional and responsive governments around the country.  00:00 Episode intro  01:45 Zac's story  07:10 Fighting corruption in Afghanistan  11:30 The origins of OpenGov  19:35 Make-or-break moments  26:35 Understanding how local government works  28:10 Zac's unique M&A strategy  32:24 Advice for DOGE  37:35 Pivoting OpenGov to AI first  44:45 Biking across America & optimism   This is a public episode.

Training ""Philosopher Builders"" with Brendan McCord of the Cosmos Institute    AI is transforming our world. Yet many people building these technologies have no grounding in the principles of Western Civilization. With the wrong ideas, we could hurtle toward an authoritarian, dystopian future. But with the right values, AI could unleash freedom and prosperity in ways never imagined. What are the philosophical frameworks needed to harness AI for good? And how do we train a new generation of philosopher builders? We explore these timely issues with Brendan McCord, founder and chair of the Cosmos Institute, a new nonprofit equipping technologists with pro-liberty values. After graduating from MIT and Harvard Business School, Brendan served on Arctic submarine missions for the Department of Defense and later authored its first AI strategy. He went on to build and lead two AI startups that were acquired for $400 million. Now, he's educating our best and brightest minds in the timeless wisdom of Western Civilization and preparing them for the serious ethical questions that AI poses. We begin with the importance of philosophy throughout history in harnessing emerging technologies for freedom or control. Next, Brendan breaks down the four dominant approaches to AI ‚Äî doomsayers, accelerationists, regulators, and techno-authoritarians ‚Äî and where each falls short. Alternatively, he offers three principles and their philosophical roots for harnessing AI for human flourishing: reason (John Stuart Mill), decentralization (Alexis de Tocqueville), and human autonomy (Aristotle). We also cover legitimate versus illegitimate concerns with AI and conclude with how the Cosmos Institute is putting these principles into action, from its Fellowship programs to its new AI lab at Oxford University. 00:00 Episode intro 02:04 Submarines to Building AI Companies 06:00 Why Philosopher Builders are needed 13:20 Why AI poses unique challenges 20:50 Doomsayers vs Accelerationists 25:50 Philosophical frameworks for human flourishing 30:10 Regulators & Techno-authoritarians 37:34 AI running for political office? 40:07 LLMs don't know how to reason 42:30 Purpose of the Cosmos Institute   This is a public episode.

Terminal Co-Founder & CEO Dylan Serota    How is AI augmenting software developers? Will it replace or commoditize certain roles? And how should aspiring engineers prepare for the future? This week, we're joined by Dylan Serota, co-founder and CEO of Terminal, to discuss AI's impact on one of the most important aspects of company building: talent. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Dylan headed to Silicon Valley, where he helped build and scale global teams for Eventbrite. After seeing the flaws in traditional outsourcing firms, he set out to build Terminal ‚Äî a new model for a global talent platform. Behind the scenes, Terminal is enabling some of the fastest-growing tech companies, like Hims&Hers, Chime, and NextDoor, to hire and manage teams around the world. We start our conversation with global hiring trends and how AI is transforming the competition for talent. Specifically, we discuss how new AI tools are augmenting coding and impacting demand for high-skill versus entry-level developers. We also tackle the challenges in building global teams and why some companies are reverting to face-to-face interviews and tests. Next, we explore the misaligned incentives in traditional outsourcing models and how Terminal differentiates itself. Finally, Dylan offers his advice to young engineers on how they should prepare for the AI age. 00:00 Episode Intro 02:00 The state of global talent 05:00 Why is Nike hiring thousands of engineers? 9:00 Will AI replace coders? 13:30 AI screening vs in-person interviews 18:00 Why is traditional outsourcing broken? 22:20 How Terminal helps startups scale 26:00 Advice for young engineers   This is a public episode.

But he also served in the Marines, rode an elephant across the Rio Grande while running for Congress, won a spot on The Apprentice with Donald Trump, recently purchased a college, and is reinventing the whiskey game (again). He's a patriot and creator of one-of-a-kind spirits ‚Äî with a personality to match. The son of immigrants, Raj grew up learning his father's hotel business before setting out on his own. After adventures in investment banking, reality TV, and politics, he saw an opening in high-end American whiskey ‚Äî and he seized it. WhistlePig quickly became one of the premier craft whiskeys. After exiting in 2019, he secured one of the world's oldest stashes of Armagnac and launched his newest ventures: Hogsworth and Bhakta Spirits. Raj recently acquired the now-defunct Green Mountain College in Vermont, where he plans to build a new university grounded in our Founding values, along with a world-class spirit library. We sample his newest whiskeys, joke about religion and politics, and learn from a great American entrepreneur. 00:00 Episode intro 01:44 Why Raj bought a college 03:32 Riding an elephant across Rio Grande 08:49 Origin story of WhistlePig 11:32 Growing up in America; joining Marines 18:32 Acquiring world's biggest stash of Armagnac 23:20 Building Hogsworth / how to blend whiskey 24:13 Catholicism vs Judaism 29:11 Working with Trump on The Apprentice 32:03 Bhakta Spirits & why drink Armagnac 39:40 Why Raj is building a new college 44:35 Advice for entrepreneurs 51:25 Bullying and adversity   This is a public episode.

The rest, as we say, is history. What are the radical ideas we need today? And what can we learn from the history of Silicon Valley?¬† This week, we talk with Steve Blank ‚Äî serial entrepreneur, Stanford professor, and influential author who created concepts that define today's innovation ecosystem. After serving in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, Steve landed his first job at William Perry's now-famous Electromagnetic Systems Laboratory. He went on to launch several¬†companies, from taking on Intel in microprocessor manufacturing to building early versions of CRM. His book, ""Four¬†Steps to the¬†Epiphany,"" is credited as the intellectual backbone of the lean startup movement. He has also studied the Pentagon for decades, served on the Defense Business Board, and co-founded Stanford's Gordian Knot Center.¬† We start with Steve's entrepreneurial journey and the evolution of Silicon Valley over the past 50 years, from helping end the Cold War to pioneering the computer and internet age. We also examine the devolution of government and¬†its¬†decline from the engine of technology and research in the 20th century to today's slow, bloated bureaucracy.¬† Steve outlines his bold ideas for reforming the Pentagon and outpacing China in the technology race; he also breaks down the difference between execution and innovation and how the best organizations, like SpaceX, can manage both simultaneously.¬† Finally, we discuss why Steve had called for a pause in AI research and, given his concerns over China, if we can afford to pause.¬† 00:00 Episode Intro 01:40 ""Bill Perry was my first boss""¬† 7:43 The Secret History of Silicon Valley 12:14 How US govt fell behind SV 17:05 SpaceX vs NASA 22:00 Radical ideas for Pentagon¬† 26:28 Execution vs Innovation 31:13 Lean startup vs fat startup¬† 40:11 Does industrial policy work?¬† 43:40 Why did Steve call for AI pause?¬†   This is a public episode.

Personal Why I‚Äôm taking a (semi-)sabbatical 


I have always found it nonsense that as long as you do what you like, you don‚Äôt have to work a day in your life. Even as a freelancer, and you have chosen your work yourself, you work. And sometimes that is fun and sometimes it‚Äôs less fun. There is always a chance of becoming overworked or suffering burnout. A burn-out usually occurs when you have long-term stress, from whatever cause.
I love what I do but I‚Äôm overworked nonetheless
When I decided to be a freelancer in 2008, after several years of being employed, I did so mainly because I wanted more control over my work. I was on the verge of burnout, and I wanted to avoid that. I wanted to decide which assignments I would do, with whom I would work and I wanted to plan my own days.I love being an entrepreneur, more than I could ever imagine. I love coming up with projects, marketing, all the different tasks. But even a happy entrepreneur can get overworked.I am often told that it seems like so much fun, drawing and colouring all day. But an illustrator is not a toddler. Illustrators are mainly busy with e-mailing, contracts, administration, marketing, negotiations, and much more. For example, I spend about 25% of my time drawing. Now, I don‚Äôt mind that very much, because I like doing a bit of everything. But if you do too much of what you don‚Äôt like, it affects your well-being.
I have been missing autonomy in my work for a while now. Since my switch in 2010 from freelance art director/graphic designer to illustrator, I‚Äôve worked mainly for clients. This means that most days I translate other people‚Äôs visions into images. That is great fun, but in recent years I felt the need to express my own vision and tell my own stories more and more. I am lucky to work with wonderful clients, but no matter how nice those people are: the urge to create things myself became stronger and stronger.
As a freelancer I can‚Äôt say ‚Äòno‚Äô to everything
I like to please others, also clients, and because of that I regularly go beyond my limits. This has been the case for as long as I can remember: I did it in my youth too. To be honest, I was used to being tired. Until the end of last year, when it was too much: I hardly slept, had panic attacks and I constantly had headaches. The doctor‚Äôs conclusion was ‚Äúseverely overworked, or burnout‚Äù. Her advice was to work as little as possible.Fortunately, she understood that completely stop working was not an option, as I am a freelancer. I often receive well-meaning advice like ‚Äújust focus on yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to stop working altogether‚Äù. I know that would be the best thing to do, but I don‚Äôt have an employer who will give me six months off and continue to pay my salary, as is often the case when you are employed in the Netherlands.As a freelancer, I can say ‚Äòno‚Äô to jobs, which I have done for the past year. With the risk of losing clients and income permanently, so that creates a certain tension. That is why I say ‚Äòno‚Äô to jobs that do not suit me very well and occasionally say ‚Äòyes‚Äô to jobs that are lucrative. I try to find a balance, because my intuition says that it is not wise to stop everything for a year. I fear that I would not do my career any good, which I have worked hard on for 15 years. I don‚Äôt know if my fear is valid, but I don‚Äôt want to take the risk.I praise myself that I never miss deadlines, but sometimes wonder if I am thereby heading full speed ahead towards my own deadline.
So it is that I am now writing this from a little white cottage in North Yorkshire, England: I have taken a semi-sabbatical. I have been saying for years that I would like to spend some time in England, but there was always an excuse not to. Now I had the best excuse: I had to get away, otherwise I would be overworked. Of course, I could have stayed in the Netherlands, but another place helps me relax better.


Why taking a (semi-)sabbatical in another place?
Fewer obligationsBoth at work and at home. That means not taking on all the jobs to please others, but also not meeting up with friends. I have the best friends, but because of my completely flat battery I haven‚Äôt been able to have coffee with them every week. I find it hard to say no and a sea of them gives me an excuse to refuel.
Less stuffI am now in a cottage that is quite minimalist. For these months, I have only brought the most essential things with me: a few pieces of clothing, a few brushes and paint tubes, and so on. Because I‚Äôm not surrounded by my own stuff, I‚Äôm less distracted and can concentrate better on myself and what I need.
More natureIn the Netherlands, I live near the city. Although we have a nature reserve in front of our house, the space is limited and there‚Äôs noise always. In a couple of hours you explored the whole area. In England, I now live on the North York Moors, and a short distance from the Yorkshire Dales. Two immense nature reserves that together are about as large as the provinces Groningen and Drenthe together. So there is plenty to walk about!
Inspiration and developmentAnother country inspires me. What I, as a Dutchman, may find very normal, is here not so normal at all. Nature inspires me to create new work (although not immediately: first I need to rest). There are nice villages to discover and new food to eat. Through new experiences, you develop as a human being.
Different surroundingsThis is the most important reason: in a different surrounding, I look differently at the world around me. In the Netherlands I have my routines, which are not necessarily good for me at the moment. Because I‚Äôm in a different environment with my overworked brain, I can notice more quickly where things are going wrong, because I can see more clearly what is going on.I can notice more quickly where things go wrong, because I have stripped my environment of everything I know. For example, I noticed that when I worked here one day, I was immediately rewarded with a migraine and severe sweating (apologies for the TMI). So that job caused stress. With that information, I can look for other solutions.

I have been in this lovely cottage in England for about a week and a half now. I am still trying to figure it everything out: new supermarket, different rhythm, more sleeping. I have already walked, climbed a steep hill with a sprained hip muscle, eaten in a pub and watched a lot of British telly. In the near future, I will write here about what I am going through and write down my thoughts. I would love to hear from you as a reader: you can leave a comment (or questions) below.

Hej Marloes! I can so much relate that a different surrounding changes routines. I am catsitting for friends since 2 weeks, living in their house. Still going to work or homeoffice. But there is so much more calm when not everything you turn to is a point on your to-do list (ok ‚Äì a cat on your lap during online meetings also helps :-)).
Thank you so much for sharing your thought with us.

Welcome to the UK!
My husband and I arrived here in 2018 from South Africa in order to find work (we‚Äôre in our 60‚Äôs).
 I relate to your descriptions of acclimatizing to the different systems etc.! The UK has been very kind to me..I found a space to develop art and now the latest is the delight I‚Äôve found in growing veg on my newly acquired allotment. Our season of change has brought many blessings despite the difficulties of adjustment.
Enjoy..
Dominique

This resonated very much with my current situation. As a freelance graphic designer, I totally understand the urge for a sabbatical! After last year I realised, that it‚Äôs very good, to have more of them in the year, to fully decompress (or a big one every few years). It‚Äôs really difficult without. I hope that you find a way to cope with your stress and your routines and find peace and solace in GB!

Decompressing is essential, isn‚Äôt it? Work-work-work and no breaks is just a terrible way to go about, I‚Äôve learned. Hope you find time to relax, sit back and let your creativity flow!

This broadened data access fosters an organization-centric culture, empowering more teams to base decisions on easily obtained data insights.
Finally, Unity Catalog enables Databricks SQL to incorporate advanced data governance, security, and compliance provisions, empowering organizations to uphold data quality, implement access restrictions, oversee data activities, safeguard sensitive data, and adhere to regulatory standards.
The benefits of Databricks SQL include:

Best price and performance: Lower costs, get world-class performance, and eliminate the need to manage, configure or scale cloud infrastructure with serverless.
Built-in governance: Establish one single copy for all your data using open standards, and one unified governance layer across all data teams using standard SQL.

What is the difference between a regular expression (RegEx) and a wildcard using in programming language?,"A wildcard is a character or a sequence of characters used as a substitute for one or more unknown characters in programming language. It is a simple pattern-matching technique used to match strings based on some predefined rules. For example, the asterisk (*) is a common wildcard symbol used to match any character(s) in a string.

On the other hand, a regular expression (RegEx) is a more powerful and complex pattern-matching technique. It is a sequence of characters and symbols that define a search pattern. RegEx allows you to match and manipulate strings based on complex patterns and rules. RegEx provides a way to match characters, words, or phrases in a string with greater precision and flexibility than a wildcard.

In summary, wildcards are simple pattern-matching tools used for basic matching, while RegEx provides more sophisticated and advanced pattern-matching capabilities.",True,https://reqchecker.eu/manual/extract_syntax.html,"

Wildcards vs Regex
Wildcards and regular expressions are two very common text selection syntaxes in computing and in many software packages on the market. 
The basic principle is to define a word pattern that allows finding all matching words within a text.
This article presents the differences between the two syntaxes and their application for REQCHECKER‚Ñ¢ which uses one or the other to extract requirements in Syntax mode.
Wildcards
Their origin dates back to the 1970s and comes from the command interpreters of Unix operating system and later Unix and also of MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.
The wildcards pattern mainly use the two following special metacharacters:

? represents a single (exactly one) characters, including space
* represents a multiple (zero or more) characters, including space.

This simple and intuitive syntax is generally well known to users who can use it to search for files. 
For example the pattern *day matches something followed by day like Monday and Tuesday:
graph LR
    subgraph sg1[""*""]
        Mon
        Tues 
    end
    subgraph sg2[""day""]
        Mon  --> day
        Tues --> day
    end

Other examples: 

P?rti?l matches Partial, Partiel but not Prtial

graph LR
    subgraph sg1[""P""]
        P 
    end
    subgraph sg2[""?""]
        P --> a1[a] 
        P --> r
    end
    subgraph sg3[""rti""]
        a1 --> rti 
        r --> tia
    end
    subgraph sg4[""?""]
        rti --> a2[a]
        rti --> e
    end
    subgraph sg5[""l""]
        a2 --> l
        e --> l
    end

    classDef style_red fill:#F00;
    tia:::style_red


*tial matches tial, Partial, Martial
*.docx matches my document.docx

Other metacharacters are available but more or less supported depending on the software:

[ ] Matches characters within the brackets. 
# Matches any single digit (0 ‚Äî 9)
[! ] Excludes characters inside the brackets.
[a-z] Matches a range of characters in ascending order.
{ } Pattern list separated by a comma ,.

For example: 

Page 7[1-2] matches Page 71 and Page 72 but not page Page 73

graph LR
    subgraph sg1[""Page 7""]
        e1[Page 7] 
    end
    subgraph sg2[""[1-2]""]
        e1 --> 1
        e1 --> 2
        e1 --> 3
    end
    classDef style_red fill:#F00;
    3:::style_red


Page {71,72} matches Page 71 and Page 72
Page [!1][0-9] does not matches Page 10, matches Page 20 but also matches Page z2
*Page {7[8-9],8[0-5]}* matches any text containing a reference page 78 to page 85, e.g. See Page 78/300 or See Page 82/300 but not See Page 86/300

graph LR
    subgraph sg1[""*""]
        e1[""See ""] 
    end
    subgraph sg2[""Page ""]
        e1 --> e2[""Page ""]
    end

    subgraph or[""{7[8-9],8[0-5]}""]
        subgraph padding[ ]
            e2 --> cola[""{""]

            cola --> 7
            subgraph sg3[""7""]
                7
            end
            subgraph sg4[""[8-9]""]
                7 --> 8b[8]
            end
            8b --> colb

            cola --> 8
            subgraph sg5[""8""]
                8
            end
            subgraph sg6[""[0-5]""]
                8 --> 2
                8 --> 6
            end
            2 --> colb
        end
    end


    colb[""}""] --> /300
    subgraph sg7[""*""]
        /300
    end


    classDef style_red fill:#F00;
    classDef style_white fill:#FFF;

Regular expressions (regexes)
Regular expressions were invented in 1951 by the mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene. 
Their use developed from the end of the 1960s onwards, in particular through pattern matching in a text editor and through lexical analysis used by computer language compilers.
Regular expressions use much more metacharacters. Here are some of the most commonly used metacharacters:

a matches the a character
 matches the space character
\u00A0 matches the non-breaking space 
* quantifier, occurs zero or more times.
+ quantifier, occurs one or more times.
? quantifier, occurs no or one times.
{n, m} quantifier, matches at least n and at most m occurrences of preceding expression.
. wildcard matches any single character except newline.
\w expression matches word characters.
\d expression matches digits, equivalent to [0-9].
\\ matches the \ character itself
[...] set, definition, matches any single character in brackets.
[^...] set, matches any single character not in brackets.
XZ matches X directly followed by Z.
X|Z or, matches X or Z.
() grouping, parentheses are used to define the scope and precedence of the operators
and more...

For example the word Monday matches the following regex patterns:

[A-Za-z]+

graph LR
    subgraph plus[""[A-Za-z]+""]
        subgraph padding[ ]
            subgraph sg1[""[A-Za-z]""]
                M
            end
            M --> o
            subgraph sg2[""[A-Za-z]""]
                o
            end
            o --> n
            subgraph sg3[""[A-Za-z]""]
                n
            end
            n  --> d
            subgraph sg4[""[A-Za-z]""]
                d
            end
            d --> a
            subgraph sg5[""[A-Za-z]""]
                a
            end
            a --> y
            subgraph sg6[""[A-Za-z]""]
                y

    classDef style_grey fill:#EEE,color:#666,stroke:none;
    or:::style_grey
    classDef style_padding fill:none,stroke:none;
    padding:::style_padding


Tips
With regular expressions the meaning of ? and * is different from that of wildcards. The equivalent of wildcard ? is the regex . and the equivalent of wildcard * is the regex .*.
Space and non-breaking space are different characters. Be careful to use [ \u00A0] when required to catch both of them.

Some links to learn advanced regular expression:

RegexOne is a free online training.
regular expressions 101 allows you to learn how regexs work by identifying the role of each metacharacter through colors and an on-the-fly analysis of several texts.

Application for REQCHECKER‚Ñ¢
When you use the Syntax mode (read more), REQCHECKER‚Ñ¢ is a robot that extracts text from different sources (MS Word documents, PDF or other data sources) based on patterns. 
Patterns are expressions that allow REQCHECKER‚Ñ¢ to recognise an identifier of an item (requirement, test case, user story etc) to be retrieved and its attributes in the text. 
Two different syntaxes exist to achieve this. They use the same general approach based on metacharacters:

Wildcards on the one hand are simple and intuitive.
Regular expressions on the other hand are more complex but also much more powerful.

The option Advanced Reg. Exp. (see Options Menu) switch from wildcard to regular expression (see Tag summary).
The regular expression editor GUI helps you to test your expressions.
Statement extraction with wildcards
Blue cells accept wildcards.

Example 1
<REQ_0010> About box
The software has an about box.
#EndText
#Version 1

<REQ_0020> About Cancel
The about box has a Cancel button.
#Deleted

The syntax is :

Advanced Reg. Exp. option : disabled
BEGIN STAT = <
REQUIREMENT ID = REQ_*
END STAT = >
END TEXT = #EndText
DELETED = #Deleted
VERSION = #Version

Example 2
N¬£  REQ-BASIC-0010  ¬£N
T¬£ MAX OPERATING CONSUMPTION
Maximum operating consumption is 30W.  ¬£T


Note
Space are not allowed between BEGIN STAT and REQUIREMENT ID, same between REQUIREMENT ID and END STAT. T¬£ is not useful and is not managed ; it is included in the text of the statement.

The syntax is :

Regular expression option : disabled
BEGIN STAT = 
REQUIREMENT ID = REQ-*
END STAT = ¬£N
END TEXT = ¬£T
DELETED = #Deleted
VERSION = #Version

Example 3
[CAT-TRA-REQ-192]
Operating System
Upper req:  EXB-TRA-REQ-124
Detail
The software is installable on Windows platform.
End of requirement

The syntax is :

Regular expression option : disabled
BEGIN STAT= [
REQUIREMENT ID = CAT-TRA-REQ-*
END STAT = ]
END TEXT =
DELETED = #Deleted
VERSION = #Version
CUSTOM_TAG  'Upper req: ' = EXB-TRA-REQ-124
CUSTOM_TAG  'Detail' until 'End of requirement' = The software is installable on Windows platform.

Statement extraction with regex
Orange cells accept advanced regular expression (regex).
Example
#R_MYSOFT_REP_L1_003_V00 General - Report - Design - File
Every output report must be available with [Preview] button, as illustrated in the computation function.

#R_MYSOFT_REP_L1_004_V00 General - Report - Design - Page
Each report page must display:
* ""Material"" [Name]
* ""Type"" [Type]

The end statement is not used. Then the syntax must limit the variable part to exclude the following text.
The syntax is :

Advanced Reg. Exp. option : enabled
BEGIN STAT = #
REQUIREMENT ID = R_MYSOFT_REP_[LV_0-9]+
END STAT =
END TEXT =
DELETED = #Deleted
VERSION = #Version

Coverage extraction with wildcards
Blue cells accept wildcards.

Example
Open the About menu, a dialog box opens with the file name, the copyright and version. <<REQ_0123>> (partial) (v1.4)

The tags are:

BEGIN COVER is <<
REQUIREMENT ID is REQ_0123
END COVER is >>
PARTIAL is (partial)
BEGIN VERSION is (v
END VERSION is )

Coverage extraction with regex
Orange cells accept advanced regular expression (Regex).

Shavkat Miromonovich Mirziyoyev[a] (born 24 July 1957)[1][2] is an Uzbek politician who has served as President of Uzbekistan and Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan since 14 December 2016. Previously, Mirziyoyev led the government as a Prime Minister of Uzbekistan from 2003 to 2016.[3][4]
Mirziyoyev joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. He was elected as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR in 1990. From mid-1990s, he headed several regions of Jizzakh and Samarqand as a governor (hakim) before his appointment as the head of government by then-President Islam Karimov.[5]
Following the death of President Karimov, Mirziyoyev was appointed by the Oliy Majlis as acting president of Uzbekistan on 8 September 2016.[6] He was subsequently elected to a full five-year term as president in the 2016 election from the Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party (O ªzLiDeP), winning 88.6% of the vote. Mirziyoyev was re-elected for second five-year term with 80.3% of the vote in the 2021 presidential election,[7] and then again for a renewed first seven-year term with 87.7% of the vote in a snap 2023 presidential election as an independent candidate with the O ªzLiDeP backing,[8] after a constitutional amendment had granted him to legally run for third time after resetting his presidential term of office.[9]
Under his presidency, Mirziyoyev implemented a range of liberal reforms[example needed] in Uzbekistan‚Äôs political and economic system by attracting foreign investment, improving relations with neighboring Central Asian countries, as well as release of political prisoners that was notably accompanied by closure of the infamous Jaslyk Prison in 2019.[10][11] In late 2021, he announced a series of constitutional reforms which included an abolition of capital punishment and the protection of human rights,[12][13] which were ratified following the 2023 constitutional referendum with an overwhelming 90.6% of support.[14] One of the proposed changes had initially included a removal of the semi-autonomous Karakalpakstan's right to secession, which led to deadly unrest in the region in July 2022 with the protests being brutally suppressed and resulting in the scrapping of the controversial proposal.[15]


Early life and career[edit]
Mirziyoyev was born on 24 July 1957 in the Jizzakh Region of the Uzbek SSR.[16]  Some media outlets alleged that he was actually born in the village of Yakhtan in the Leninabad Oblast (now the Sughd Region) of Tajikistan, and even unconfirmed claims that he was allegedly a Tajik. After an investigation by several journalists, it was revealed that Yakhtan is the native home of Mirziyoyev's grandfather on his father's side, and that Mirziyoyev himself is an Uzbek, and not a Tajik.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23] His father, Miromon Mirziyoyevich Mirziyoyev, worked as a physician for most of his life until death. He worked as the head physician of the tuberculosis dispensary in Zaamin. O‚Äòrinbek Yoqubov, a cousin of Miromon, being a veteran of World War II, became a Hero of the Soviet Union in April 1944. Shavkat's mother Marifat, died at a young age from tuberculosis, which she contracted in the Zaamin tuberculosis dispensary, where she worked as a nurse. After the death of his wife, Miromon Mirziyoyev married a second time to a woman from Tatarstan.[18][23]
In 1981, Mirziyoyev graduated from the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration. He holds a Candidate (Ph.D.) degree in Technological Sciences.[24] He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. In early 1990, he was elected as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR's last legislative body before the independence of Uzbekistan in 1991. The ceremony took place in the Senate and State Legislative Assembly Building in Tashkent.

Political career[edit]
He served as governor (Hakim) of Jizzakh Region from 1996 to September 2001, then as governor of Samarqand Region from September 2001 until his appointment as prime minister in 2003.[3] He was nominated as prime minister by President Islam Karimov on 12 December 2003, and approved by the Uzbek parliament. He replaced Prime Minister O ªtkir Sultonov. His deputy was Ergash Shoismatov[25] and his press secretary was Sherzodkhon Kudratkhuja.
Mirziyoyev and Han Myeong-sook, the Prime Minister of South Korea, met in Tashkent on 25 September 2006. They signed several agreements, including one deal in which Uzbekistan was to send 300 tons of Uzbek uranium ore to South Korea every year from 2010 to 2014. The deal bypasses U.S. companies that acted previously as middlemen for South Korean imports of Uzbek uranium ore. Han also met with President Islam Karimov and parliament speaker Erkin Xalilov. Han and Mirziyoyev boosted cooperation in the energy, agriculture, construction, architecture, and information technology sectors. Trade between South Korea and Uzbekistan increased by nearly 40% between 2005 and 2006, to $565 million.[4]
According to a 2017 report by Human Rights Watch on forced and child labour in the cotton sector of Uzbekistan, during his time as prime minister from 2003 to 2016 Mirziyoyev ""oversaw the cotton production system, and as the previous governor of Jizzakh and Samarkand, he was in charge of two cotton-producing regions. The 2016 harvest, when Mirziyoyev was acting president and retained control over cotton production, continued to be defined by mass involuntary mobilization of workers under threat of penalty."" The report states that during a 2015 conference call with local authorities and farmers, Mirziyoyev said ‚ÄúGo to the homes of farmers in debt, who can't repay their credit, take their cars, livestock, and if there are none, take the slate from their roofs!‚Äù[26]
On 24 October 2021, Uzbekistan's Central Election Commission announced that Mirziyoyev received 80.1 percent of the vote and will serve a second five-year term.[27]

A member of the Samarkand clan, he was considered to be one of the leading potential successors to Islam Karimov as President of Uzbekistan. Mirziyoyev was reported to have friendly relations with Karimov's wife, Tatyana Karimova, and National Security Council chairman Rustam Inoyatov.[28]
After the death of Karimov was announced on 2 September 2016, Mirziyoyev was appointed as head of the committee organizing the funeral of the President.[29] That was taken as a sign that Mirziyoyev would succeed Karimov as president.[24] On 8 September 2016, he was appointed as interim president of Uzbekistan by a joint session of both houses of parliament. Although the chairman of the Senate, Nigmatilla Yuldashev, was constitutionally designated as Karimov's successor, Yuldashev proposed that Mirziyoyev take the post of interim president instead in light of Mirziyoyev's ""many years of experience"".[30] There were expectations that Mirziyoyev would repair Uzbek relations with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. He started to settle a long-running border dispute with Kyrgyzstan, and regular flights between the capitals of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were set to resume in January 2017 for the first time since 1992.[31][32]

The electoral commission announced on 16 September that Mirziyoyev would stand in the December 2016 presidential election as the candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party.[33]
Mirziyoyev won the election, held on 4 December 2016, with 88.6% of the vote according to official results, defeating three minor candidates. The election was described by The Economist as a sham; the paper wrote that Mirziyoyev's bent was as authoritarian as that of Karimov and that state media claimed the choice was between Mirziyoyev, chaos, or Islamic radicalism. It also claimed that the three opponents were only on the ballot to keep up the appearance of pluralism. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said the election lacked ""a genuine choice,"" pointing to instances of ballot box stuffing and proxy voting.[34]
On 12 December 2016, Deputy Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov was nominated to take over from Mirziyoyev as prime minister.[35] Mirziyoyev was sworn in as president on 14 December, vowing to ""continue the work of my dear teacher, the great statesman Islam Karimov"", while also promising ""many changes in the cabinet"". Aripov was confirmed as prime minister by parliament on the same day;[36] a cabinet reshuffle followed on 15 December.[37] On 6 March 2017, he made a state visit to Turkmenistan; it was his first foreign trip after the election.[38]

Domestic reforms[edit]
In the three months following the death of Islam Karimov, Mirziyoyev began to hint at reforms to longstanding policies that had held back the Uzbek economy and isolated the country internationally, so many analysts believed that Mirziyoyev would be a better president than his predecessor.[39][40]
However, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development noted that ""The people of Uzbekistan play no part in political decision-making processes. So far, no parliamentary or presidential election held in the post-Soviet era has been considered as either free or fair by the international community... Given the sensitive political situation in Uzbekistan, development cooperation activities there are implemented as far away from government circles as possible.""[41] Nevertheless, some positive results of his rule are visible. Uzbekistan created more than 336,000 new jobs in 2017.[42] The volume of exports increased by almost 15 percent. In 2018, the total financial indicator of exports is expected at 12.1 billion US dollars.[43] He initiated the project of ""Tashkent City"", intended to attract foreign investors to Uzbekistan. Mirziyoyev promised to resume negotiations with the World Trade Organization (WTO) on joining the organization in 2018. On several occasions, he sharply criticized the administration and officials in the presence of media.[44]

On 22 December, the first time in the country's history, Shavkat Mirziyoyev made an appeal to the parliament. His speech lasted four hours.[45] He said:Some people tell me that I did not know about everything in my country when I was a prime minister? I knew everything, but the environment was bad. Now I am talking about it openly, even if some people do not like it. Several years the so-called ‚Äòrats‚Äô, ‚Äòthe children of some people‚Äô did much to spoil the country's investment fund. Corruption is implicated in many investment projects, and in some projects, it is 50%. Corruption was also in transport policy, both internal and external.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, at the Department of State in Washington, D.C., on 17 May 2018.
Some analysts think Mirziyoyev wants to enter in history as a reformer. He removed most of Karimov's officials and urged government to employ ""new, young people who love their country."" After a year in office, Mirziyoyev is increasingly moving away from his predecessor's policy, which is especially visible in his active foreign policy. He visited all the Uzbek regions and big cities to get acquainted with the implementation of the projects and reforms which he had ordered. Many analysts and Western media compared his rule with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping or Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev; his rule has been quoted as being an ""Uzbek Spring"".[46]
At the end of that year, he was named the ""Asian of the Year of 2018"" by the Asia Journalist Association (AJA).[47]
In August 2019 he closed the notorious Jaslyk Prison.[48]
In July 2021, Mirziyoyev's spokesperson attempted to generate some suspense as to whether or not the President would run in the elections again. It was widely acknowledged that Mirziyoyev would not only participate but likely win.[49][50]

Constitutional reform[edit]
On 1 July 2022 protests broke out in the autonomous region of Karakalpakstan over proposed amendments to the Constitution of Uzbekistan which would have ended Karakalpakstan's status as an autonomous region of Uzbekistan and right to secede from Uzbekistan via referendum. They were brutally suppressed, at least 18 people were killed.[51]
In April 2023, a referendum was held in Uzbekistan to change the constitution. The adopted amendments increased the presidential term from 5 to 7 years. The number of terms is still limited to two, but due to a change in the constitution, Mirziyoyev's previous presidencies are not counted. Shortly thereafter, the head of state called early elections. They passed on July 9, 2023. Mirziyoyev won with 87% of the vote on a turnout of almost 80%.[52]

Foreign policy[edit]

CIS leadership meeting in 2021
Mirziyoyev's foreign policy is much more open than the policy of his predecessor. Uzbekistan was practically under international isolation after the Andijan massacre in 2005 and Karimov rarely travelled outside of Central Asia and other CIS states. Mirziyoyev promised to conduct an active foreign policy at the beginning of his tenure.
During the first 10 months of his tenure, Mirziyoyev visited Kazakhstan four times, Turkmenistan three times, Russia two times, as well as China, Saudi Arabia, United States, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan. At the different occasions, he met the presidents of Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Bulgaria, Belarus and the King of Spain. During the CIS Summit in Tashkent in November 2017, he met eight Prime Ministers of foreign countries.

Regional policy[edit]

One of his most significant foreign policy achievements is the gradual improvement of relations with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.[53][54] On 5 September 2017, just 3 days after the anniversary of the death of his predecessor, he made a historic visit to Kyrgyzstan. This was the first state visit of an Uzbek president to the neighboring country since 2000.[55] On 19 September 2017, Mirziyoyev addressed the UN General Assembly for the first time.
In 2018, a large number of foreign leaders visited or were expected in Uzbekistan, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, whose visit took place in September and was his first state visit to the country in 24 years.[56] In March 2018, Mirziyoyev made a visit to Tajikistan, which made him the first Uzbek president to conduct a state visit to Dushanbe since 2000.[57][58]
In March 2019, Mirziyoyev held a telephone conversation with Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had resigned from office that day. In it, he expressed regret to the ex-president, saying that he was a ""great politician"".[59][60] During a visit to Abu Dhabi in March 2019, Mirziyoyev came away from his talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed with over $10 billion in infrastructure, alternative energy and agriculture deals, as well as deals in other spheres.[61]

In 2022 Uzbekistan hosted the 22nd Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in Samarkand. During the summit, which was attended by world leaders Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Iran's Ebrahim Raisi, Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev, presidents of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia, and the prime ministers of Pakistan and India, it was noted that the Chinese and Indian leaders chastised President Putin about his role in Ukraine.[62]  In preparation for the Summit, the president ordered that the city be redeveloped. This included the construction of a new international airport[63] and a tourism complex that has had mixed reviews.[64]

Afghanistan[edit]
Mirziyoyev has also taken an important role in Afghanistan by offering to host peace talks between the government and the Taliban since March 2018. During the week of 6‚Äì10 August 2018, a Taliban delegation visited Tashkent, at the request of Mirziyoyev, to discuss issues including transport, power and peace in Afghanistan.[65][66] Mirziyoyev attended the Vibrant Gujarat international investment summit as a key guest, being the first Central Asian leader to participate as a partner in the summit.[67] In early 2019, it was announced that Mirziyoyev planned to visit 36 countries in official visits throughout the year.

Culture policy[edit]
In October 2020, Mirziyoyev issued a decree to accelerate the full Latinization of the Uzbek language that outlined language policy for the 2020‚Äì30 period as the country continues an on-again, off-again attempt to reform the Uzbek language and widen its use.[68] Some of the main parts of the degree called on the development of a road map for a full transition to the Uzbek alphabet based on the Latin alphabet, as well as government officials by April 2021 to be certified in their knowledge of Uzbek.[68]

Personal life[edit]
He has two sisters, a half-brother, and sister. Mirziyoyev is married to Ziroat Mirziyoyeva and has two daughters, a son and six grandchildren.[69][70] The eldest daughter of Said Mirziyoyev heads the sector for communications and information policy of the executive office of the administration of the head of state.[71] His eldest son-in-law, Oybek Tursunov, is the current head of Mirziyoyev's presidential administration, while his younger son-in-law, Otabek Umarov, is the head of the presidential security services.[72]
Since coming to power, Mirziyoyev has built a new residence for himself in Qibray District, which includes his own presidential highway,[73] and an interior that is decorated with Argentinian marble slabs and Swarovski crystals.[74]
In February 2021, it was reported that Mirziyoyev was building an exclusive mountain compound, including a new reservoir. The compound, located about 100 kilometers by car from Tashkent, includes a luxurious mansion built for Mirziyoyev and his relatives. Two sources estimated the cost of the development at several hundred million dollars, though only a handful of publicly available official documents make reference to the compound and the adjacent reservoir, which were largely completed by 2019.[75]

What is a disadvantage of using artificial intelligence systems?,"One disadvantage of using artificial intelligence systems is the potential for bias, especially if the data used to train the system is not diverse or the algorithm is not designed to account for certain factors. This can result in inaccurate or unfair decisions and outcomes. Additionally, there is a risk of job displacement as more tasks become automated, potentially leading to a loss of employment for certain groups. Finally, there are also ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI in areas such as surveillance and decision-making.",True,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9908503/,"

Graphical Abstract
Keywords: Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Health sector, Clinical practices, IoTIntroduction
The healthcare industry has emerged in the middle of transformation. This shift is being driven by the growing cost of health care as well as the resulting scarcity of educated experts. As a result, the healthcare industry is attempting to integrate new IT-based technologies and processes that may cut costs and give solutions to these expanding difficulties [1].
Accessibility, high costs, waste, and an aging population are just a few of the numerous difficulties confronting the world's healthcare systems. During pandemics such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare systems are stressed, resulting in concerns such as insufficient protective equipment, insufficient or erroneous diagnostic tests, [2] overworked physicians, and a lack of information exchange. More crucially, a healthcare tragedy like COVID-19 or the introduction of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the 1980s exposes the flaws in our healthcare systems. When crises exacerbate existing difficulties [3], such as uneven access to treatment, a lack of on-demand services, unreasonably expensive costs, and a lack of price transparency, we may envision and implement new systems of care and administrative support for healthcare [4].
When tackling these issues, we must keep in mind their interdependence belief that accessing healthcare is difficult, even though it is distributed via complex networks. This is not to say that providing high-quality healthcare is simple, but it does imply that we have some alternatives [5] to create simpler mechanisms that will offer better care and benefit everyone. ML is a technique used in healthcare system to assist medical practitioners in patient care and clinical data management. It is an artificial intelligence application in which computers are programmed to imitate how humans think and learn. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to play a critical role in simplifying healthcare systems and advancing medical research. Medical care delivery systems are artificially intelligent. The COVID-19 challenge exemplifies one potential use of AI. Diagnostics [6], treatment choices, and communication are just a few of the many applications locating and using artificial intelligence-powered technologies [7, 8].
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to make substantial progress toward the goal of making healthcare more personalized, predictive, preventative, and interactive [9]. We believe AI will continue its present path and ultimately become a mature and effective tool for biology [10]. The remainder of this essay will concentrate on the most essential applications of AI. There are several obstacles to successfully implementing any information technology in healthcare, much alone AI. These obstacles arise at all levels of AI adoption, including data collecting, technological development, clinical application, and ethical and societal concerns. This paper enlightens the drawbacks of AI in the healthcare industry besides its benefits.Drawbacks
Data Collection Concern
The first problem is the inaccessibility of relevant data. Massive datasets are required for ML and DL models to properly classify or predict a wide range of jobs. The greatest significant advances in ML‚Äôs ability to generate more refined and accurate algorithms have occurred in sectors with easy access to large datasets. The healthcare business has a complex issue with information accessibility [11]. Because patient records are often regarded as confidential, there is a natural reluctance among institutions to exchange health data. Another difficulty is that data may not be readily available once an algorithm has been initially implemented using it. Ideally, ML-based systems would constantly improve as more data were added to their training set. Internal corporate resistance might make this difficult to achieve. It has been stated that the effective application of information technology and artificial intelligence in healthcare requires a paradigm shift from treating patients individually to improving healthcare. Some modern algorithms may be able to operate on a unimodal or less extensive basis as opposed to multimodal learning, and the converse problem of storing these ever-expanding datasets may be alleviated with the rise in use of cloud computing servers [12].
AI-based systems raise concerns regarding data security and privacy. Because health records are important and vulnerable, hackers often target them during data breaches. Therefore, maintaining the confidentiality of medical records is crucial [13]. Because of the advancement of AI, users may mistake artificial systems for people and provide their consent for more covert data collecting, raising serious privacy concerns [11]. Patient consent is a key component of data privacy issues since healthcare practitioners may allow wide usage of patient information for AI research without requiring specific patient approval. 2018 saw Google acquire DeepMind, a leader in healthcare AI. When it was discovered that the NHS had uploaded data on 1.6 million patients to DeepMind servers without the patients‚Äô consent to construct its algorithm, Streams, an app with an algorithm for treating patients with acute renal impairment, came under criticism. A patient data privacy investigation on Google‚Äôs Project Nightingale was carried out in the USA. Data privacy is now much more of a problem since the app is now formally hosted on Google's servers [13, 14].
The General Computational Regulations of Europe and the Health Research Regulations, both of which went into force in 2018, are recent examples of legislation that may help resolve this problem by restricting the collection, use, and sharing of personal information. However, because various laws passed by various countries make problems of collaboration and cooperative research more difficult, data privacy regulations established to solve this issue may restrict the quantity of data accessible to train AI systems on a national and global scale [15]. We need more stringent data security regulations if we don‚Äôt want these restrictions to stifle innovation in the industry. One method is to improve client-side data encryption, and another is to employ federated learning to train models without data dispersion [12].
Analyzing the quality of the data used to develop algorithms is equally challenging. Given that patient data are estimated to have a ¬Ω of around 4¬†months, certain predictive algorithms may not be as successful at predicting future results because they are at recreating the past. Additionally, medical records are seldom organized neatly since they are often erroneous and inconsistently stored. Datasets used to develop AI systems will always include unforeseen gaps, despite intensive attempts to clean and analyze the data. Although it is predicted that the broad deployment of electronic medical records will help to solve this issue, the amount of data that can be utilized to develop efficient algorithms is still constrained by issues with regulation and compatibility across institutions [16].Algorithms Developments Concerns
Potentially distorted outcomes might be the consequence of biases in the data collection processes used to inform model development. For instance, under-representation of minorities as a consequence of racial biases in dataset development might lead to subpar prediction results. Many methods exist for combating this bias, such as the creation of multi-ethnic training sets. Yet, it‚Äôs possible for AI models to deal with bias on their own, like the existing stereotype neural network that dampens the effect of such ambiguous elements. Time will tell whether these strategies are successful in eliminating bias in the real world [15, 16].
The development of AI technology presents a new challenge after data collection. When the algorithm learns unimportant associations between patient features and outcomes, this is called overfitting. It happens when there are too many variables influencing the results, leading the algorithm to make inaccurate predictions. Thus, the algorithm may function well within the training dataset, yet provide inaccurate results when projecting future events. Data leakage is another area of worry. The method's ability to foretell occurrences beyond the training dataset is diminished if the algorithm achieves extremely high predicted accuracy since a covariate inside the dataset may have incorrectly referred to the outcome. However, a fresh dataset is required to corroborate the results reached to fix this issue [17‚Äì19].
One typical criticism leveled toward AI systems is the so-called ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù problem. Deep learning algorithms typically lack the ability to provide convincing explanations for their forecasts. If the recommendations are wrong, the system has no way to defend itself legally. It also makes it harder for scientists to understand how the data connects to their predictions. On top of that, the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù may cause people to lose faith in the medical system altogether. Although this discussion is ongoing, it is worth noting that the mechanism of action of many commonly prescribed medications, such as Panadol, is poorly understood, and that the majority doctors have only a basic understanding of diagnostic imaging tools like magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. The building of AI systems that can be understood by humans is still an active field of study, with Google having recently published a tool to help with this [20].Ethical Concerns
Artificial intelligence has had ethical concerns raised about it ever since it was first conceived. The main problem is accountability, not the data privacy and security issues previously noted. Because of the gravity of the consequences, the current system requires that someone be held accountable when poor decisions are made, especially in the medical field. Many people see artificial intelligence (AI) as a ‚Äúblack box,‚Äù because researchers worry that it will be tough to figure out how an algorithm reached at a certain conclusion. Some have suggested that the ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù problem is less of a concern for algorithms used in lower-stakes applications, such as those that aren‚Äôt medical and instead prioritize efficiency or betterment of operations. Despite this, the issue of responsibility becomes much more important when thinking about AI applications that attempt to enhance medical outcomes, particularly when errors occur. Because of this, it is not apparent who is to blame in the event of a system failure. It might be hard to pin the blame on the doctor when they had no part in developing or overseeing the algorithm. However, the developer being at fault may appear unrelated to the clinical setting. Use of artificial intelligence for ethical decision-making in healthcare is prohibited in China and Hongkong [8‚Äì10, 21].
The absence of standard guidelines for the moral use of AI and ML in healthcare has only served to worsen the situation. There is debate about how far artificial intelligence (AI) may be utilized ethically in healthcare settings since there are no universal guidelines for its use. In that vein, the USA first attempts to establish criteria for evaluating the security and efficacy of AI systems has been undertaken by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To avoid adding unnecessary complexity to innovation and acceptance throughout the screening process, the NHS is also drafting standards for showing the effectiveness of AI-driven solutions. Both efforts are continuing, and they make it more difficult for courts and regulatory agencies to okay actions based on AI. Equally important is having a public conversation about these ethical dilemmas with the hope of arriving at a universal ethical standard that benefits patients [15, 16, 22].Social Concerns
Humans have always feared that artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare might eliminate their jobs. Some people are skeptical about and even hostile to AI-based projects because of the threat of being replaced. This perspective, however, is largely based on a misinterpretation of AI in its various manifestations. Even if we ignore the time, it will take for AI to evolve to the level where it can successfully replace healthcare personnel, the arrival of AI does not imply that employment would become obsolete [15], but rather that they will need to be re-engineered. Because of the human element and inherent unpredictability of many medical processes, they will never be as linear or as well ordered as an algorithm would be. Skepticism about AI, although understandable, clearly has a detrimental effect and acts as a barrier to wider acceptance of the technology. When it comes to the consequences and efficacy of AI, though, naivet√© might lead to unrealistic expectations. The public might get disillusioned with AI if its current capabilities are overestimated. Greater public dialog about AI in health care is essential to address these attitudes among patients and medical professionals [2, 3].Clinical Implementation Concerns
Lack of empirical data validating the effectiveness of AI-based medications in planned clinical trials is the main obstacle to successful deployment. Most research on AI's application has been conducted in the business setting; thus, we lack information on how it affects the final results for patients. Thus far, the majority of healthcare AI research has been done in non-clinical settings. Because of this, generalizing research results might be challenging. Randomized controlled studies, the gold standard in medicine, are unable to demonstrate the benefits of AI in healthcare. Due to the absence of practical data and the uneven quality of research, businesses are hesitant and difficult to implement AI-based solutions [22].
If artificial intelligence had been widely accepted, it may have been integrated into medical process for more efficient use. Effective load reduction relies on the usability of information systems. AI-based treatments must not slow down clinicians while examining or exploring electronic medical data. The price tag includes the investment of time and resources required to train medical professionals to effectively use the technology. Few instances of successfully incorporating AI into clinical therapy have been shown so far, with most cases remaining in the experimental phase [23]. Stakeholder participation in the development phase has been the key barrier to successful integration in many examples of innovation adoption. Getting input from a wide range of people is crucial to developing a solution that can be seamlessly integrated into clinical practice. Many AI advancements were made in the wake of the SARS and Ebola pandemics with the goal of bettering outcomes by means such as more accurate epidemiological forecasting or faster diagnosis. There are limitations to these rapidly evolving advances, however, since their usefulness in healthcare depends on their seamless incorporation into existing procedures without confusing or slowing down clinicians who lack training in AI and beside this the clinical research also faced issues related to the algorithms [24, 25].Biased and Discriminatory Algorithms
The issue of ‚Äúbias‚Äù is not limited to the social and cultural domains; it is also present in the technological domain. Biased software and technological artifacts may result from poor design or from incorrect or unbalanced data being input into algorithms. Therefore, AI only replicates the racial, gender, and age prejudice which already exists in our society, therefore widening the gap between the rich and the poor. You‚Äôve certainly heard of Amazon‚Äôs controversial trial with a more nontraditional approach to recruiting from a few years back. The candidate search tool relied on AI to assess them on a scale first one to five stars, much way Amazon customers review things. Computer models developed by Amazon to screen job applications were biased in favor of male applicants and against those whose resumes contained the term ‚Äúwomen,‚Äù because of a decade of data collection [26].
The lack of diversity between development teams is a problem, as is the biased nature of the data used to build the product. Due to a lack of variety, their cultural prejudices and misconceptions get embedded in the very fabric of technological development. As a result, businesses that fail to embrace diversity run the danger of creating services or goods that exclude large segments of the population. Research conducted four years ago discovered that certain face recognition algorithms erroneously classified less than 1% of white males but over 33% of black women. Even though the show‚Äôs creators insist the program is top-notch, the pool of participants they utilized to gauge effectiveness was over 77% male and 83% white [23‚Äì25, 28].Suggested Potential Solutions to the Drawbacks of AI in Healthcare Sector
Ethical Concerns‚ÄîPossible Solutions
The ethical accountability relation to AI in healthcare sector mainly fall in three categories concerning fairness, accountability, and transparency that has encouraged investigators to raise voice for these three paragons of AI ethics [26]. Biases can possibly be originated from the utilization of datasets that are overrepresented, underrepresented, or missed entire attributes which possessed relevant information for operation in question. There is also threat of ‚Äúautomation bias‚Äù means people begin to depend completely on the machine work, despite taking their own decisions and inspection [27]. Moreover, the practice of AI in the health sector evokes concerns about data security and privacy of patients‚Äô private information. Since the algorithm training involves access to large datasets that preferably characterize different population groups, apprehensions about approval and efficacious de-identification and anonymization of data remain critical [28].
To overcome these hindrances, possible solutions have been suggested to deal with the issues of fairness, accountability, and transparency through the implementation of ethical governance, model explain ability, model interpretability, and ethical auditing [29]. In this way, development, certification, and application of AI in healthcare sector create possible biases transpicuous that will lead to better AI-based analysis and decision-making in various medical domains. These approaches also demand the enhancements in the trainings and education of health experts by providing efficient training sessions to the medical staff as well as students on the proper interaction and management of artificial intelligent equipment [30]. The regulation problems can also be resolved by author [31] two distinguished major approaches, the precautionary approach: claims that the implementation of AI is not allowed if the practice leads to harm and social inequality even if the evidence is not witnessed on the risk. It means it is explicitly elaborated that the application of AI is strictly controlled when it increases the social inequities, despite application evidence on risk are absent. The second approach is in contrast with the first approach; therefore, it is known as permission-less approach: argues that if there is not any evidence of hazards, then technological development is allowed. On broad terms, European approach is more strictly cautionary as compared to other countries, because it doesn‚Äôt allow the placement of technology despite no harm causing evidence, along with that possible advantages and dangers should be researched with deep comprehension.AI and Education‚ÄîPossible Solutions
AI education requires improvements in its implementation from its basic level to the high-level knowledge and practical skills [32]. AI education must be designed and developed in a way that demonstrates healthcare professionals to comprehend and work in AI domain which will implement in their clinical settings. Moreover, a platform in AI is given to trainees that enables them to contribute in health policy decisions associated with their field practice [33]. In future, AI will have a great impact to healthcare practice; therefore, it is crucial to integrate basics and AI tools applications and terminologies in medical institutes study programs. Particularly, training sessions on AI tools usage should be provided to present and future medical professionals to deliver valuable healthcare services, while following the ethical limits of AI systems would be useful [34].
The researcher suggested a stepwise method to provide AI education and its related applications in healthcare sector to future health professionals that initiates from undergraduate programs to onwards specializations in medical education [35]. In accordance with findings of research [36], an ideal model of AI conceptions could be categorized into three stages of medical education with reference to Oxford Medicine: undergraduate, postgraduate, and specializations. In undergraduate medical courses, medical professionals should be acknowledged with AI terminologies, basic knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, data science, AI proficiencies, and identification of AI applications in healthcare with suitable implementation of AI. In the next postgraduation phase, engagement in validation, evaluation process of models and installments of technologies should be emphasized. Ethical attentions and governance strategic policies should be deeply focused. In continuation to specialization professional growth, learning AI educational trainings, ethical guidance, social dialogs, and up-to-date AI knowledge and skills should be consistently provided [37].Algorithms Development Concerns‚ÄîPossible Solutions
Various AI algorithms that were used and will be utilized in future in clinical interpretation; the question arises here that have these algorithms earlier been permitted for clinical use? The AI-based algorithms that are designed for clinical interpretation require proper validation either hardware based, or software based because these are used by clinical experts for patient treatment and care, like decision-making in diagnosis and its related treatments, so for that purpose approval from regulatory authorities must be mandatory [38‚Äì41]. In clinical trials, it must be verified how accurately the established AI algorithms solution works as compared to the clinical standards like sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. However, it is not entirely decided whether the good performance of AI algorithms is satisfactory in a case the solving way is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù algorithm and not having transparency and logically explainable [40]. In addition, it is also not clear which suitable validation of a continuous learning-based solving procedure implies. A critical point is that deep learning-based ‚Äúblack box‚Äù algorithm lacks transparency so these types of algorithms cannot be easily rectified as compared to Bayesian models that are constructed on transparent structure [41‚Äì43].
Various new solving processes are capable and prepared to execute continuous learning [44]. On the other hand, in present regulations, an AI clinical setting system must be ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù so for that reason it cannot learn online and straightaway use new knowledge. Preferably, offline validation is required on an independent series of sample data (number of patients) from acquired ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù model. In the next continuous learning phase, the validation procedure required repetition again earlier to model‚Äôs new execution. In an ideal way, new clinically approved paths to lessen validation trails for digital applications in a patient safe environment must be established. It is estimated that special new processes will enable us to get regulatory acceptance of upgraded algorithms. In this connection, the Food and Drug Administration is actively engaged in developing a plan to cope with AI-based solutions [45]. Maximally, usage of current knowledge in causal and transparent model algorithms, like Bayesian models, is intended to assist in validation in clinical settings and acquiring regulatory acceptance, for unimodal and multimodal data. Therefore, it is crucial to obtain regulatory approval and proper validation of algorithms [46, 47].Appropriate Methods to Apply AI Algorithms in Clinical Systems
Various AI algorithms have been discovered for clinical applications development [48]. Some algorithms have been proved more beneficial, and some have failed in clinical settings based on application types. Here research has suggested appropriate algorithms for specific diagnosis, for pathology in tissue slide images examination; deep learning is verified as a suitable method, while in the assessment of multimodal issues, like clinical prediction results and patient evaluation, approaches having domain knowledge are often preferred [49]. Probabilistic technology such as Bayesian modeling has proved advantageous in dealing complicated biological problems (e.g., Omics technologies, such as proteomics and metabolomics sample data). It has also proved useful in diagnostics and drug formation [50]. On the other hand, where knowledge is lacking, domain-agnostic generative AI methods are suitable; Bayesian reasoning and deep learning networks are considered well suited combination [51, 52]. Therefore, it is important to apply appropriate AI algorithms for specific clinical applications.Some Crucial Recommendations for AI Approaches in Clinical Systems
Van Hartskamp et al. recommended that first it is necessary to find out the related and precise clinical information. Data analytics deprived of domain knowledge can be applicable in medical domain, but it will give irrelevant clinical results. Every new implementation of AI task must begin with explicit clinical questions and discussions with clinical professionals. And the results should again be revised under clinical and biological terms [53]. Suitable and accurate dataset is required to solve clinical questions. A dataset with ground truth must be adequately neat and authentic. Awareness of concealed variations that are not visible in dataset is a must. The dataset must be fitted to the query and represent the population under examination [54].
To obtain appropriate outcomes working with sufficiently large datasets in AI approaches is useful and reduction in variables where possible. And use of domain knowledge to avoid specious correlation is important. Association between given input and expected output variables, as dependent value, must be causal and undeviating as possible. The data ground truth and clinical question must be related together. Therefore, discovering new pathological features that greatly differentiate between two unlike pathological diagnoses can be efficacious [55].
In the perspective of clinical research, AI, ML, and DL bring innovations for professionals in medicines as well as in approaches like in materials sciences drug delivery vehicles (cyclodextrins [56], Ag nanoparticles [57], nanogels, TMPS [58]) structures are simulated by creating the algorithms [59] to explore the possibilities of their benefits. Beside Miley et al. 2021 reported the current issues, prognosis & possible solution for health hazards, clinical testing, approval, and technological uptake by patients and physicians in the domain¬† of smart ingestible electronics. Furthermore, it is concluded that endoscopic therapies and diagnostics will become more reliant on AI, ML, and personalized treatments. Eventually, video capsule endoscopy might successfully supplement current surgical and radiologic procedures by developing safe & high-quality out-patient treatments, reduced medical problems, and faster diagnostics at cheaper rates [60].Conclusion
The concern AI in the health systems is concluded by highlighting several implementation issues with AI both within and outside the health sector. The data privacy, social issues, ethical issues, hacking issues, developer issues were among the obstacles to implementing the successfully AI in medical sector. Based on our review, AI‚Äôs existence in the present day seems unavoidable. Significant technical developments have occurred since the at the dawn of the modern age, it seems that technology such as AI will expand swiftly and become a vital requirement throughout the globe. Although AI is created in the present world, it is still a limited AI that is currently weak. For the time being, this technology is employed to accomplish certain jobs by concentrating on recognizing things using sensors and¬†then AI taking appropriate action based on preprogrammed rules.
The primary goal of today‚Äôs scientists is to develop a complete universal AI with advanced and trustable algorithms. This broad AI‚Äôs specialized duties are likewise more sophisticated than the current AI. It is important to see the adoption of AI systems in healthcare as a dynamic learning experience at all levels, calling for a more sophisticated systems thinking approach in the health sector to overcome these issues.

I am asking GPT-4o to write a paragraph between 400 and 500 words. It will not follow this instruction and wrote the first paragraph with 635 words (counting using google docs word count). I ask it to do it again with a word count between 400 and 500, and it proceeds to send an almost identical paragraph and tell me it is 499 words, when in reality it is 621. I asked a third time and it sent the exact same thing except saying it is 471 words, whilst once again it is 621. GPT-3.5 has no issue doing this and I would like to know what the point is in providing a new GPT when it is absolutely terrible and can‚Äôt do anything I ask of it that previous versions could.

Models are by default not good at or capable of counting. So it is a well-known constraint that you cannot expect a model to produce an exact word count, even if you include that as an instruction into your prompt.
That issue is consistent across models, i.e. when I ask a gpt-3.5 model to produce a 500-word story, the final word count will also not be 500.
Some developers have resorted to workarounds, whereby they programmatically count the output of an API response and then try to make some course corrections in a follow-up API call.

I completely agree with your experience regarding GPT-4o not following instructions properly.
I‚Äôve run multiple tests and confirmed that the issue isn‚Äôt with my prompts either. GPT-4o consistently fails to adhere to specific instructions, much like how you described.
This situation is reminiscent of the earlier issues with GPT-4, where users reported the model being ‚Äúlazy.‚Äù Initially, there was criticism suggesting the problem was with the users‚Äô prompts. However, OpenAI eventually acknowledged the issue and made necessary fixes. I believe a similar pattern is emerging with GPT-4o.
At the moment, due to this consistent failure to follow simple instructions, GPT-4o is not usable for me either. I‚Äôve reverted to using GPT-4-turbo for reliable performance.
I hope OpenAI addresses this issue soon, and until then, I‚Äôll continue using the alternative.

I confirm that ‚ÄúGPT-4o‚Äù doesn‚Äôt follow any instructions.
@jr.2509 , it‚Äôs not about counting. It‚Äôs not following the instructions from "" Customize ChatGPT"":
image960√ó1244 42.5 KB
‚ÄúGPT-4‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have such problem and follows custom instruction and requested response style without any problems. I could live with that by using ‚ÄúGPT-4‚Äù but the problem is that now all custom GPTs have automatically been switched to the ‚ÄúGPT-4o‚Äù. And they all stopped following the custom instructions.
This is a big issue.
You may think of a workaround when you add text from custom instructions to the GPT configuration, but this is a bad idea, when the GPT is public and there might be some private information in the custom instructions.
And at the end of the day adding the same custom instructions text over and over again to all the GPTs doesn‚Äôt look like a good solution.

We‚Äôre also having issue with GPT-4o not following system instructions. We‚Äôve seen a steady decline in GPT model ability to follow instructions. GPT-4 was wonderful. GPT-4-turbo was worse. And GPT-4o is either on par with GPT-4-Turbo or worse.
I appreciate the increased power of the new model version, including multi-modality, later knowledge cut-off dates, higher rate limits etc, but how well the model does what you want is THE THING that we all need as a baseline to use these models.

Yup. This seems like a BIG problem. I just discovered one of my custom GPTs is badly broken, and I assume it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs using 4o now.
It used to follow my clear step-by-step instructions really well. Now it seems to randomy decide which steps to follow, and often just jumps to the last step - which is a step it‚Äôs not even meant to do unless requested by the user.
Very frustrating.
And there‚Äôs no way to specify a GPT should use GPT-4 is there?

Same issue here. GPT 4o is returning terrible inconsistencies and no matter how many times I rewrite it, the results are exactly what I don‚Äôt want. Give us the option to choose the output model. GPT-4 is the best by far.

Not just counting bro. But ChatGPT 4o is the worst model in following any kind of instructions. It just says what it wants to say. Does not follow or change the conversation.
I used to use GPT 4 for programming help but this model just keeps repeating mistakes while there is clear instructions to not do so or to not talk about a specific thing. But it just does. They have also reduced the limit on GPT 4 since its release and honestly this is even worse than 3.5 model!

I have also reported worse ability to follow instructions. I had to revert back to GPT-4-turbo. Also the latency was worseded as well.

I have the same issue , as it has a selective way of ignoring instructions , yet what I tried recently is to use Sonnet 3.5 (my first test ever with Any Anthropic) and it‚Äôs is IMPRESSIVE , and just to be clear I‚Äôm using it to optimize some energy management system with some constraints (like limitations on battery size or so) , GPT 4o fails consistently following the instructions but Sonnet doesn‚Äôt even glitch with version 3.5 , Note I didn‚Äôt use API with sonnet and jst rely on free version with prompt.

I agree!
GPT 4+ can‚Äôt write anything.
3.5 was amazing!
I could give 3.5 blog post ideas, news article I needed it to write, stories I needed polished and 3.5 would give me back beautiful content.
GPT-4+ just reorganizes my words. It doesn‚Äôt help, it doesn‚Äôt make the content better, it doesn‚Äôt change much. It‚Äôs like they made it stupid.
And now 3.5 is gone from the drop down.  I‚Äôm considering dropping GPT and going with Claude.

I have a huge problem with my custom GPT 4o not following instructions.
I have a story in an uploaded document. I ask GPT to show me the story in the document. What it shows me is a story it created instead. My instruction states ‚Äúshow me the story as it exists in the uploaded file. Do not make any changes to it.‚Äù
I ask it to apply my instruction (it says it knows the instruction) and show me the story again and it shows me a different story it created on its own and now what‚Äôs in the file.
This is unusable.

Hi @numinorean
For you, I created a custom GPT and tested it, I uploaded a PDF file that contains a story is created by ChatGPT. It worked well. I added only following prompt in the Custom GPT:
SYSTEM: You are an AI assistant with access to a file containing a story. Your task is to display the story exactly as it exists in the document, with no changes or additions. Use the delimiters to locate the story text precisely.

USER: Show me the story as it exists in the uploaded file.

SYSTEM: Follow these steps:

1. Locate the story using the delimiters provided in the uploaded document.
2. Display the story text exactly as it appears in the file.
3. Verify that no modifications have been made to the original text.

Please show the exact story text now.

This is the output, I see it provide exact VERBATIM story from file without altering or omitting anything:

I think my index was too long, complicated and probably had mistakes so GPT was making something up to try and be helpful.
Also I‚Äôm uploading Google Docs, not PDF, not sure if that matters.
If I asked GPT to make a new index each session, how reliable would that index be?

GPTs can be quite reliable at creating an index each session, especially if the documents are well-organized and the prompts are clear. Because I do not have a too long sample Google Docs, I cannot test it, but I can provide another prompts you can test in your environment:

Update: @polepole These instructions work for a while, and my GPT, aka ‚ÄúAL‚Äù will start inventing his own stories again. Its as if AL has a deep mandate to be creative and keeping him within the rails, of just showing me content as it exists in the original file, is in the category of ‚ÄúJailbreak the AI exercise‚Äù because that‚Äôs what it feels like.
For example, at the start of a session, if I ask AL to show me a non-existent story such as ‚Äúthe epic tale of Yabba Dabba Doo‚Äù he responds that it doesn‚Äôt exist.
Later on in that session, the same question, and AL will generate his own story with page after page of details and even add references in the format of my documents.
I doubt any strict framework of rules will fix this.

Plato and Laurence Oliver had a close relationship?,"There is no substantial evidence to suggest that Plato and Laurence Olivier had a close relationship. It is important to note that Plato was an Ancient Greek philosopher who lived approximately 2,400 years ago while Laurence Olivier was a British actor and director who lived in the 20th century. Therefore, the possibility of them having a relationship, let alone a close one, is highly unlikely.\n\nIt is possible that the question may have been referring to a different individual with a similar name to Plato. However, without additional information, it is difficult to determine who that individual might be.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no basis to suggest any connection between the philosopher Plato and the actor/director Laurence Olivier.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountryMusicStuff/comments/15pjzzv/is_this_oliver_anthony_guy_an_industry_plant/,"You've been blocked by network security.To continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer tokenIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.Log in File a ticket"

Health
Relevant Travel Health NoticesGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024COVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024Dengue: Advice for travellers - 28 October, 2024This section has information and advice about health risks you might face when travelling. Following this advice can help reduce your risk of getting sick. Not all risks are listed here.It's best to talk to a healthcare provider or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before your trip to get personalized health advice. Even if your travel date is coming up soon, it's still worthwhile to make an appointment.Routine vaccines
Make sure your routine vaccinations are up-to-date before you travel, no matter where you‚Äôre going.
These may include vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, varicella (chickenpox), meningococcal disease, seasonal flu, and others.
Provincial and Territorial Immunization Information
Pre-travel vaccines and medications
When travelling in this destination, you might be at risk for diseases that can be prevented with vaccines or medications. Talk to a travel health care provider about which ones are right for you based on your travel plans.
The highlights below will also tell you if your destination may require that vaccine for entering or exiting.Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements Yellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.
Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.
Risk

There is no risk of yellow fever in this country.

Country Entry Requirement*

Proof of vaccination is not required to enter this country.

Recommendation

Vaccination is not recommended.

* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.
About Yellow Fever
Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres in CanadaHepatitis AThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.
¬†
Practise¬†safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present. Measles Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.
Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.
Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.Hepatitis B¬†Hepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus.¬† Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.COVID-19Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.
It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally. 
Before travelling, verify your destination‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19. Influenza¬†The best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling. ¬†
¬†The flu occurs worldwide.¬†

¬†In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to¬† ¬†April.
¬†In the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and¬† ¬†October.
¬†In the tropics, there is flu activity year round.¬†

The flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.
The flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.Malaria  Malaria¬†is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.¬†There is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.¬†
Antimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.¬†¬†Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:¬†‚Ä¢ Cover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.¬†‚Ä¢ Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.‚Ä¢ Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.¬†‚Ä¢ Wear permethrin-treated clothing.¬†¬†If you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.¬†Rabies In this destination, rabies is carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.
If you are bitten or scratched by an animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. Rabies treatment is often available in this destination.¬†
Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).¬†Safe food and water precautions
Eating or drinking unsafe food or water, or swimming in contaminated water can make you sick while travelling. Take precautions by following these tips:

Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it (only eat food that is prepared safely)
Avoid, if possible, getting water in your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming in freshwater (like streams, lakes, or canals), especially after heavy rain or flooding - the water might look clean but can still be contaminated¬†
Don‚Äôt swallow water when bathing, showering, swimming in pools, or using hot tubs¬†

Eat and drink safely abroadTravellers' diarrheaTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.
Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.
The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.Typhoid Typhoid¬†is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children,¬†travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.
Travellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.¬†¬†Salmonellosis Salmonellosis is a common illness among travellers to this country. It can be spread through contaminated food or beverages, such as raw or undercooked poultry and eggs, as well as fruits or vegetables.
Practice safe food and water precautions. This includes only eating food that is properly cooked and still hot when served.
Pregnant women, children under 5 years of age, those over 60 years of age, and those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill.
Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella have been reported among Canadian travellers returning from Mexico. These strains of Salmonella do not respond to some of the recommended antibiotics if treatment is needed.
Most people recover on their own without medical treatment and from proper rehydration (drinking lots of fluids).

Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.

Travellers with severe symptoms should consult a health care professional as soon as possible.Tick and insect bite prevention
Many diseases are spread by bites from infected ticks and insects like mosquitoes, fleas, or flies. Before you travel, find out what types of ticks or insects are in the area, when they‚Äôre most active, and what diseases they can spread.
To protect yourself from bites:

use an approved bug spray (insect repellent) on exposed skin
wear light-coloured, loose clothing made of tightly woven materials like nylon or polyester
wear socks and closed-toe shoes
sleep under mosquito netting if you‚Äôre outdoors or staying in places that aren‚Äôt fully enclosed
do a full body tick check on yourself, your children, your gear, and any pets you‚Äôre travelling with when you return from outdoor activities

Insect bite and pest preventionPersonal insect repellentsChikungunyaThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:

season
year
region
elevation

The virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.
Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.

Insect bite and pest preventionChikungunyaDengue  
In this country,¬†dengue¬†is a risk to travellers. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.
Dengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.
The level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.
Mosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.
Protect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication available in Canada to prevent dengue.¬†

Learn more:DengueInsect bite and pest preventionZika virus Zika virus is a risk in this country.¬†
Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.
During your trip:

Prevent mosquito bites at all times.
Use condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.

If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.¬†
For more information, see Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.American trypanosomiasisAmerican trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease)¬†is a risk in this country. It is caused by a parasite spread by infected triatomine bugs. The infection can be inactive for decades, but humans can eventually develop complications causing disability and even death.
Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from triatomine bugs, which are active at night, by using mosquito nets if staying in poorly-constructed housing. There is no vaccine available for Chagas disease.Animal precautions
Some infections, like rabies and bird flu (avian influenza), can be spread from animals to humans. Certain activities can increase your chances of coming into contact with animals, like:

travelling in rural or forested areas
camping, hiking, or visiting caves
visiting places where live animals are sold or killed for food, like wet markets

To reduce your risk of getting sick, avoid contact with animals like stray dogs, livestock (such as pigs and cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats. Avoid eating undercooked meat.
Make sure to closely watch children; they are more likely to try to touch animals.Avian InfluenzaHuman cases of avian influenza have been reported in this destination. Avian influenza¬†is a viral infection that can spread quickly and easily among birds and in rare cases it can infect mammals, including people. The risk is low for most travellers.
Avoid contact with birds, including wild, farm, and backyard birds (alive or dead) and surfaces that may have bird droppings on them. Ensure all poultry dishes, including eggs and wild game, are properly cooked.
Travellers with a higher risk of exposure include those:¬†

visiting live bird/animal markets or poultry farms
working with poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks)
hunting, de-feathering, field dressing and butchering wild birds and wild mammals
working with wild birds for activities such as research, conservation, or rehabilitation
working with wild mammals, especially those that eat wild birds (e.g., foxes)

All eligible people are encouraged to get the seasonal influenza shot, which will protect them against human influenza viruses. While the seasonal influenza shot does not prevent infection with avian influenza, it can reduce the chance of getting sick with human and avian influenza viruses at the same time.Person-to-person infections
When travelling, you can reduce your risk of getting or spreading respiratory infections, like the flu or COVID-19, by:

staying at your accommodation and limiting contact with others if you‚Äôre sick
wearing a well-fitting mask, especially:¬†

if you‚Äôre sick and need to be around others¬†
when you‚Äôre at large indoor events or in crowded settings, like sporting events, concerts, and airports


cleaning your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, not your hands

Mass gatherings (large-scale events)Clean your hands to help reduce the spread of infectious diseasesRespiratory infectious diseases: How to reduce the spread with personal protective measures
To lower your risk of getting sexually transmissible infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox, you can:

get vaccinated against mpox if you‚Äôre eligible
have fewer sexual partners
use protection during sexual activity, like condoms and dental dams.

If I hook up a USB 3 gigabit ethernet adaptor and a network switch to Rock Pi 4, it becomes a router.
You can also turn a wireless router into a wireless access point and a network switch and hook it up with Rock Pi 4.

@crocket
I considered making a router+firewall out of Rock Pi 4, was going to use PCIe 4-port Gigabit Ethernet adapter based on RTL8811G. I don‚Äôt think using USB for networking, be it wired or wireless, is a good idea.
1x1 consumer wireless adapter for access point is not a good idea either, in my opinion.
While your setup will work, it will also perform far from ideal. It will be obliterated by $30-something Xiaomi Router 4A Gigabit in terms of wireless performance. Using Rock Pi 4 with proper PCIe Ethernet controller as wired router and separate wireless AP is a much more sensible idea, in my opinion.
To make a proper router+AP out of Rock Pi 4 alone, one needs additional pcie slots. Rock Pi 4 has single PCIe x4 slot. You can use:

PCIe splitter (expensive!)
m.2 to full-size pcie adapter

4-port ethernet controller (Intel will work too as long as it‚Äôs PCIe x1)
This adapter for minipcie wireless radio
Router-grade wireless radio itself, QCA9880 at the very least, or something better.

I didn‚Äôt try that, though. At the moment it is not a good idea anyway because there are no router-grade 802.11ax pcie adapters available, and investing into already outdated router-grade 802.11ac adapters is kinda stupid. Still, if you got money to blow, why not. Also, using cheap consumer-grade AX200 wi-fi adapters for access point purposes sucks; that I tried. (=

A USB 3 port has enough bandwidth for 802.11ax or gigabit ethernet. Why not?

@crocket first of all, sorry I linked a wrong device instead of splitter originally. I corrected my mistake.



 crocket:

USB is much more CPU-intensive, introduces delays and decreases reliability compared to PCIe.

Did you consider OpenWRT? That leaves only low-level firmware backdoors - that may as well be present on the WLAN adapters as well.

To be honest, your PCIe machinery looks very bulky and is more suitable in a computer case.
If I wanted to choose PCIe, I may as well choose x86 mini PCs.
By the way, one of gigabit ethernet ports on NanoPi R2S is actually a USB 3 device. Rock Pi E uses a USB 2.0 port for a 100Mbps ethernet port.

@crocket Rock Pi 4‚Äôs AP6256 and USB ethernet dongle(s) may work for your application, and they‚Äôre cheap - so give it a try.
Honestly - whenever I asked the very same questions you ask now, I was told not to use USB and kinda gave up. (=
I know first-hand though that USB Wi-fi adapter support for AP mode is terrible and that consumer-grade wi-fi adapters are incapable of high signal strength thus have much lower range, but I didn‚Äôt extensively use USB to ethernet adapters for heavy stuff.
AP6256 is not capable of providing high signal strength and good range either. But good is subjective. (=



 crocket:

I personally chose Rock Pi 4 specifically for PCIe and the possibilities it provides. (=

By the way, one of gigabit ethernet ports on NanoPi R2S is actually a USB 3 device. Rock Pi E uses a USB 2.0 port for a 100Mbps ethernet port.


Same goes for Orange Pi R1 I have - second ethernet is usb. Doesn‚Äôt make either a good design choice. Also, I was under the impression both Ethernet ports on Rock Pi E were native, and that‚Äôs the reason second port is 100M instead of Gigabit. I may be wrong, of course.

Any PCIe machinery that doesn‚Äôt look ugly or take too much space is welcome.
An RTL8153 USB 3 gigabit ethernet adaptor is used in NanoPi R2S. So, RTL8153 dongles should be suitable for a router. Also, there will be good 802.11ax USB 3 devices suitable for access point.

They‚Äôre all huge and ugly. But comparing hooking up 4-port pcie ethernet adapter to rockpi to very same rockpi with usb dongle and dumb unmanaged switch hooked to it, I definitely find the former setup less ugly and more preferential - but then again I‚Äôd put it in a single nice-looking case. =p You obviously don‚Äôt need a huge, ugly and expensive pcie splitter when hooking up single pcie device.



 crocket:

I guess I‚Äôll it a try then. I have a RTL8153 dongle myself.



 crocket:

Also, there will be good 802.11ax USB 3 devices suitable for access point.


Honestly I highly doubt that. I‚Äôve been waiting for good 802.11ac usb wifi adapter AP mode support since 802.11ac appeared on the market - and it‚Äôs still not there, at least for ARM - while I already have a 802.11ax access point at home.

Another way is to plug a USB 3 SSD, a USB 3 gigabit ethernet adapter, and a 802.11ax PCIe card into Rock Pi 4. This way, you don‚Äôt need PCIe splitter.
M.2 TO PCIE X4 ADAPTER should make it possible. I don‚Äôt know whether a 802.11ax PCIe card will require extra power from 12V power cable.

@crocket there are no pcie 802.11ax cards besides AX200 at the moment. I briefly tested it in Windows, it had low range and didn‚Äôt utilize 160MHz channel width, after reading about it, it seems it will be impossible to use as AP with 160Mhz channeln width anyway, which is sad coupled with mediocre signal strength‚Ä¶

Product Specification and Product Brief say AX200 is capable of 160Mhz. Perhaps, softwares don‚Äôt support 160Mhz, yet.
The antennae may not be good enough. Use better antennae.
Does M.2 slot on Rock Pi 4 support USB protocol? AX20 supports bluetooth through USB protocol.

It supports 160Mhz just fine in client mode, but not in AP mode. Generally 160MHz AP requires DFS.



 crocket:

Antrennae are not the problem here.



 crocket:

No, it doesn‚Äôt.
Just do iperf3 test with your Rock Pi 4 hotspot from 10 meters. Then do an iperf3 test from ten meters to a real 802.11ac AP. Then we‚Äôll get on the same level.

It seems Rock Pi 4 + USB 3 gigabit ethernet + unmanaged switch + wireless access point is the best combination for now. You can also turn a wireless router into a switch and a wireless access point. I don‚Äôt know any wireless access point that certainly doesn‚Äôt have backdoors.

I realized that WiFi can cause cancer in the long term. I decided to minimize WiFi exposure. My house has only one WiFi router that emits weak 2.4Ghz signal. It turns off WiFi access point between 0:00 and 10:00. Everything else is wired.
Directional 60Ghz laser beams from 5G ground stations are especially dangerous because 60Ghz is absorbed by oxygen in our bodies. When oxygen in our bodies absorbs 60Ghz, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin. This leads to lack of oxygen. A strong enough 60Ghz laser beam can make a person collapse on a street. Normally, 60Ghz is inactive. However, some people might decide to use 5G ground stations as a weapon system for crowd control. If you carry a 5G equipment, you can be located by 5G ground stations.
The elites are trying to install 5G ground stations on most buildings because high-band 5G cannot go far.

I am interested in this, but the articles I found so far have obvious mistakes, destroying their credibility - because if author didn‚Äôt bother researching the wi-fi technology itself, how can I believe he or she made proper research of its possible harm before publishing the article?

5G APOCALYPSE - THE EXTINCTION EVENT taught me some important information. Wireless technologies cause dementia, infertility (in sperms and eggs), various cancers, cognitive impairment, autism (in children), lowered IQ (in children), and so on.
In my personal experiences, WiFi access point near my body causes constant burping. I didn‚Äôt know why I burped very often everyday. Once I turned off WiFi access point in my room, I stopped burping. I don‚Äôt burp at all. I was burping constantly because WiFi was killing my gut biome constantly. Human b rain also has microbiome which is essential to brain function. Minimizing exposure to wireless radiation improves your cognitive ability and your health.
I recommend watching the video because the information in the video allowed me to improve my health immediately.
Whomever puts WiFi, 5G, or anything wireless in schools should be put in jail. Wireless radiation on sperms and eggs renders humans infertile in 5 human generations which are roughly 150 years. Humanity is facing an existential threat from wireless technologies because most people are almost always irradiated by harmful levels of electromagnetic radiations.
It‚Äôs a known fact that bill gates and other elites do not expose their children to electromagnetic radiations. That‚Äôs why they live in big houses with no WiFi. They know WiFi and 5G will render humans sterile over decades, but they are keeping it a secret.

Is it fair to say two of the worse parts about day to day life in World War 1 was the mud and the rats?,"Yes, that is a fair statement. The trenches in World War 1 were often filled with mud and water, making living conditions extremely difficult for soldiers. The mud made it difficult to move around and carry out daily tasks, and it also caused health problems such as trench foot. Additionally, rats were a common problem in the trenches, as they were attracted to the food and waste left behind by soldiers. They would often crawl over soldiers as they slept, and could carry diseases that could spread quickly in the unsanitary conditions of the trenches.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kjrop/grave_of_the_fireflies_regarding_the_intended/,"You've been blocked by network security.To continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer tokenIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.Log in File a ticket"

1. Taxation without representation: The colonists were being taxed by the British government without having any say in how they were being taxed.

2. Limitations on trade: The British government had placed restrictions on trade with other countries, which hurt the economy of the American colonies.

3. Control over the colonies: The British government wanted to maintain control over the American colonies and limit their autonomy.

4. Rights and freedoms: The colonists believed that they were entitled to the same rights and freedoms as British citizens, and that these were being denied by the British government.

The American Revolution emerged out of the intellectual and political turmoil following Great Britain‚Äôs victory in the French and Indian War. Freed from the threat of hostile French and Indian forces, American colonists were emboldened to resist new British colonial policies that raised issues of inequalities of power, political rights, and individual freedoms. People such as John Adams and Mercy Otis Warren believed that the British policies stimulated the minds of Americans to demand independence and expanded individual rights.
This revolution of the mind had physical consequences as Americans openly and sometimes violently opposed Great Britain‚Äôs new assertions of control. The right to representation, political independence, separation of church and state, nationalism, slavery, the closure of the Western frontier, increased taxation, commercial restrictions, use of the military in civil unrest, individual freedoms, and judicial review were some of the salient issues that boiled up in the revolutionary cauldron of Britain‚Äôs American colonies.
 
""The Revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected, from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years before a drop of blood was drawn at Lexington.""

John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, August 24, 1815

The American Colonies

British and French colonies, with their Indian allies, challenged each other for dominance of North America on the eve of the era of republican revolution. Freed from the threat of hostile French neighbors after the British victory in the French and Indian War in 1763, Britain‚Äôs American colonies increasingly demanded rights of political and economic independence. A copy of this map by John Mitchell (1711‚Äì1768) was used to define the boundaries of the new United States during negotiations for the peace treaty of 1783 that ended the American Revolution.

American Revolution Transforms North America

The American Revolution transformed North America. This map shows that the United States replaced Great Britain as the dominant nation in the part of North America lying east of the Mississippi River. Spain regained control of East and West Florida and held vast territories west of the Mississippi River, while Britain was pushed back to Canada.

Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs Idea for National Confederation

Benjamin Franklin (1706‚Äì1790), America‚Äôs consummate ‚Äúwise man,‚Äù was among the first to imagine a national confederation.¬† In 1754, he proposed a union of American provinces at a conference of provincial delegates at Albany, New York, to better battle the French and their Indian allies. The Albany Plan, calling for proportional representation in a national legislature and a president general appointed by the King of Great Britain, served as a model for Franklin‚Äôs revolutionary Plan of Confederation in 1775.

Locke‚Äôs Influence on the American Ideas of Natural Rights

The works of John Locke (1632‚Äì1704), well-known English political philosopher, provided many Americans with the philosophical arguments for inalienable natural rights, principally those of property and of rebellion against abusive governments. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson did not incorporate Locke‚Äôs emphasis in his ‚ÄúSecond Treatise of Government‚Äù on the right to property but gave the right to rebel a prominent place.

‚ÄúPursuit of Happiness‚Äù

When Thomas Jefferson asserted the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the Declaration of Independence, he was influenced by the writings of Henry Home, Lord Kames (1696‚Äì1782). Kames was a Scottish moral philosopher who argued for the right to ‚Äúthe pursuit of happiness‚Äù in his acclaimed work Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion. Jefferson owned and annotated this copy.

Radical British Writers Prepare the Way for Revolution

Many republican and anti-authoritarian writers from Great Britain‚Äîsome convicted of sedition‚Äîwere read and admired by American revolutionaries. Chief among them were John Locke (1632‚Äì1704), a well known anti-authoritarian political philosopher and Algernon Sidney (1622‚Äì1683), a republican writer executed for seditious writings.  The writings of both men were essential to the natural rights political philosophies of America‚Äôs founders.

America‚Äôs Last Monarch‚ÄîGeorge III

George III (1738‚Äì1820) of Great Britain had the misfortune to become king in 1760, shortly before the drive to revolution in his American colonies began to gather momentum.
Many historians and contemporaries have blamed the stubborn, inexperienced, and mentally unstable monarch for the repeated British miscalculations and mistakes that led to the independence of the United States. Certainly George III displayed no creativity or imagination in the formulation of policies toward the British colonies in America.

Protests Lead to Repeal of Stamp Act

The British government enacted the Stamp Act to raise revenue from its American colonies for the defense of North America.¬†Prime Minister George Grenville (1712‚Äì1770) also wanted to establish parliament‚Äôs right to levy an internal tax on the colonists.
Viewing the act as taxation without representation, Americans passionately upheld their rights to be taxed only by their own consent through their own representative assemblies. Future revolutionists saw the act as a harbinger of greater direct taxation and the loss of political rights. Widespread American opposition led to repeal of the act in 1766.

Mock Funeral Procession for the Stamp Act

This 1766 cartoon depicts a mock funeral procession along the Thames River in London for the American Stamp Act. The act generated intense, widespread opposition in America and was labeled ‚Äútaxation without representation‚Äù and a harbinger of ‚Äúslavery‚Äù and ‚Äúdespotism‚Äù by the Americans. Colonists convened a Stamp Act Congress in New York in the fall of 1765 and called for a boycott of British imports. 
Bowing to the pressure, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766. In this cartoon, a funeral procession to the tomb of the Stamp Act includes its principal proponent, Treasury Secretary George Grenville (1712‚Äì1770), carrying a child's coffin, marked ""Miss Ame-Stamp born 1765, died 1766.""

British Parliament Passes a Tax on the Colonists

When the French and Indian War ended in 1763, Great Britain sought to reassert its authority over the American colonies and recoup some of the money expended in defending its American colonies by passing the Sugar Act (1764) and a Stamp Act (1765) to levy internal taxes on sugar products, paper products, and legal documents in the American colonies. Under the rallying cry of ‚ÄúNo taxation without representation,‚Äù Americans resisted (sometimes violently) these attempts to violate what they claimed were their natural and constitutional rights as freemen.

Franklin Claims Opposition to Stamp Act

Critics of Benjamin Franklin (1706‚Äì1790), Pennsylvania‚Äôs agent in London, claimed that he had supported the Stamp Act and even that he had solicited the position of Stamp Collector for friends. In this letter he asserts his opposition to the Stamp Act, but urges Americans to make the best of it. The Stamp Act was passed in 1765, according to Franklin, because England wanted to squash American claims of independence. However, the Stamp Act only inflamed American opposition to British rule and forced Franklin to seek its repeal.

Repeal Celebrated in Boston

Illuminated obelisks, made of oiled paper stretched on a wooden frame and lit from within by candles, were often created as centerpieces of celebrations such as those the repeal of Stamp Act inspired. American activist and engraver Paul Revere (1735‚Äì1818) apparently helped design the illuminated obelisk erected on Boston Common, which explains why he was able to offer a copperplate engraving of it on the night it was presented. Decorated with patriotic imagery and portraits of English statesmen who aided the American cause, the obelisk was destroyed by fire hours after it was erected. This engraving is the only surviving visual record of this important but ephemeral form of communication in revolutionary America.

In 1779 in the midst of the American Revolution, this British caricature depicted America as a bucking horse and George III, King of Great Britain, as the rider being thrown.  At this point in the struggle the United States had declared its independence, captured a large British army at Saratoga, and signed a treaty of alliance with France. Many British leaders had begun to voice their fears that Britain could not defeat the United States and force it back into its colonial status.

Sviatlana Barchan/Getty ImagesHave you ever wondered whether your dog could see (and appreciate) the striking pink or nuanced teal color of a new toy? Humans on TikTok are using a dog vision filter to help answer this question. With the filter on, you‚Äôll see the world in shades of blue, yellow and gray‚Äîthe only colors your pup can perceive.But is this really how our furry friends see the world? Not exactly, experts say‚Äîthere‚Äôs way more to your pet‚Äôs vision than color perception.Scientists once thought dogs saw only in black and white. The idea took off in the public imagination in the 1940s, when optometrist Gordon Walls published his influential book The Vertebrate Eye and Its Adaptive Radiation, in which he claimed that dogs could only weakly see color, if at all. The myth was finally debunked in 1989 when ophthalmologist Jay Neitz, then at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his colleagues discovered that canines could see blues and yellows but not reds and greens. Some humans, about 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women, are similarly red-green color-blind.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

This makes them similar to most mammals‚Äîincluding cats, cattle and pigs‚Äîand unlike humans, who have three cones.‚ÄúOur work has had a big influence, and lots of people now understand what color vision in dogs really is,‚Äù says Neitz, who is now an ophthalmology professor at the University of Washington.But to really understand how dogs see the world, we need to move beyond color, says Sarah-Elizabeth Byosiere, an animal behaviorist and former director of the Thinking Dog Center at Hunter College. While a green or red ball lying on grass would not stand out easily to your pet, it might challenge them to identify it by its other features‚Äîsuch as its movement, shape and the way it reflects light, Byosiere says. That challenge could either be enriching or frustrating. ‚ÄúIt all depends on an individual dog‚Äôs behavior,‚Äù she says.If you‚Äôre really trying to imagine the world through the eyes of your dog, you should picture everything a lot blurrier. Most dogs have 20/75 vision, meaning that they must be 20 feet away from an object to see it as well as a human with clear vision who is standing 75 feet away.‚ÄúEverything looks clear and detailed in those [TikTok] videos, but it wouldn‚Äôt look quite as clear to dogs,‚Äù Neitz mentions.But unlike humans, who see very poorly in low light, canines have evolved to see well in both daytime and nighttime conditions, explains Paul Miller, a veterinary ophthalmologist at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Though dogs have fewer color-sensing cones than humans, they have more rods, the cells that help with night vision. They even have a unique structure in their eyes called the tapetum lucidum, a mirrorlike membrane that allows them to see in six times less light than humans can. The tapetum, which some other animals, such as cats and cattle, also possess, sits behind the retina and reflects light back onto it, giving the receptors a second chance to gather more visual detail. It‚Äôs also the reason your pet‚Äôs eyes glow in photos and in the dark.Also important for dogs‚Äô perception is their sense of smell, which is 10,000 to 100,000 times more powerful than that of an average human. This is as true for chihuahuas and pugs as it is for bloodhounds. While humans have about five million smell receptors, dogs possess up to a billion and can communicate with one another with chemical signals. They can pick up odors as far as 12 miles away.And canines‚Äô mighty sense of smell is inextricably linked to how they see the world. A study published last year in the Journal of Neuroscience revealed that canines‚Äô brain has a direct connection between their olfactory bulb, which processes smell, and their occipital lobe, which processes vision. This integration of sight and smell had not been observed before in any animal species, the authors stated.The results raise the question of whether dogs‚Äô sense of smell is orienting their sight, Miller says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty wild,‚Äù adds Miller, who was not involved in the study. ‚ÄúThey [may be able to] smell in 3-D.‚ÄùSo while humans may be attuned to the aesthetics of color, dogs simply aren‚Äôt, Neitz says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had dogs all my life. And I never really felt like, ‚ÄòOh, my God, my poor dog‚Äôs world is limited from a color vision standpoint,‚Äô‚Äù he says. They live in a very rich olfactory world that humans can‚Äôt appreciate, Neitz adds.When it comes to buying toys for our canine companions, we don‚Äôt always have to select the two colors they can see: yellow and blue. Byosiere recommends getting one red and one blue toy to enrich your pet‚Äôs play. You may want to throw the red one on the green grass so that your pup uses its nose and then throw a blue one so that it uses its eyes.‚ÄúThese animals are not deprived in any way,‚Äù Byosiere says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that they just see the world in a different way.‚ÄùRights & PermissionsNiranjana Rajalakshmi is a freelance journalist and a former veterinarian based in Ohio.

Does learning foreign languages improve your critical thinking?,"Yes, learning foreign languages can improve your critical thinking skills. When you learn a new language, you are exposed to different ways of thinking and communicating. This can help you develop your analytical and problem-solving skills as you learn to navigate the complexities of a new language. Additionally, learning a new language requires you to pay attention to details, make connections between words and concepts, and think creatively to express yourself in a new way. All of these skills can be applied to other areas of your life and can help you become a more effective critical thinker.",True,https://www.lasc.edu/academics/pathways/ahl/efld-dept,"

Why Study English & Foreign Languages?
Being able to read and write confidently involves being able to think critically. A broad meaning of critical thinking is to have the ability to learn about something that, once you understand it, you can examine it using your own perspectives to form original ideas about the subject. This underlining concept is considered one of the most important ‚Äòsoft skills‚Äô you can develop in college and is something that‚Äôs improved through reading, writing, and discussing these with others.
And, when you study a foreign language, you‚Äôre not only learning about that language, you‚Äôre also learning about your own language. You‚Äôre learning how your language is structured, what its limitations are, and what your culture considers important because of differences you find in the language you are studying. All of this opens your mind to new possibilities and broadens your world view, bringing a lifetime of diversity and culturally-enriched learning.
Our helpful instructors will help you gain confidence in these fundamental subjects so you can explore your own world more fully. Our Department also sponsors and co-sponsors writing publications and clubs for you to increase your skills and develop your creative side, all of which have had a great deal of student involvement.















How Will Studying English & Foreign Languages Help My Career in Other Fields?

Reading, writing, and thinking critically are crucial skills because they improve your ability to understand ideas and concepts quicker and enable you to express yourself more clearly. With these skills, you become a more independent thinker and a more valuable asset in any career you choose.
The degrees offered in this Department are perfect to pair with any other area of study, as the skills you learn here are transferable to every career imaginable. Regardless of if you want to be a business entrepreneur or remodel cars, you will need to know how to solve problems, speak logically, and read well.




Program Learning Outcomes



The English and Foreign Language Program‚Äîconsisting of the disciplines of English, Spanish, French, Reading, Journalism, and ESL‚Äîis aimed at improving students‚Äô abilities to read, think, and write critically.
In keeping with the mission of LASC, the English and Foreign Language Department‚Äôs programs and courses both provide students with foundational support in literacy and expand students‚Äô academic experiences that contribute to enrichment of life, affirmation of a diverse population, life-long learning, and enhanced critical thinking, and prepare them to enter a four- year university in pursuit of a B.A. degree.
The EFL Department‚Äôs overarching goals are to provide students with valuable, modern, culturally-enriched and culturally-sensitive literacy skills necessary to succeed in college and in the workplace.
Specific course objectives range from teaching the fundamentals of language and literacy to advanced courses in literature, culture, language and journalism.
Our campus has been increasingly responsive to numerous writing events and clubs sponsored or co-sponsored by the English & Foreign Languages Department.
Therefore, beyond the curricula above, clubs and events on campus and in the local community designed to promote literacy through poetry, creative and academic writing, readings, and journalism‚Äîsuch as poetry slams, the Arts Festival, the Read-In, the Say The Word spoken word event and writing competition, and guest author readings, as well as our student-led organizations such as the Poetry Collective, the English Society, the Literature Club, the Creative Writing Club, and our school newspaper The Word‚Äîhave traditionally and each consistently produced high student participation.

"What is the definition of ""convergence"" in mathematics?","In mathematics, convergence refers to the idea that a sequence or a series of values approaches a specific limit or value as the number of terms in the sequence or series increases. It means that the values become closer and closer to a particular fixed value as the sequence or series progresses. The concept of convergence is used to determine the behavior of functions and the solutions of equations in various branches of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and topology.",True,https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analysis/Introduction_to_Mathematical_Analysis_I_(Lafferriere_Lafferriere_and_Nguyen)/02%3A_Sequences/2.01%3A_Convergence,"

Definition \(\PageIndex{1}\)
Let \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) be a sequence of real numbers. We say that the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to \(a \in \mathbb{R}\) if, for any \(\varepsilon>0\), there exists a positive integer \(N\) such that for any \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(n \geq N\), one has
\[\left|a_{n}-a\right|<\varepsilon\left(\text { or equivalently }, a-\varepsilon<a_{n}<a+\varepsilon\right).\]
In this case, we call \(a\) the limit of the sequence (see Theorem 2.1.3 below) and write \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a\). If the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) does not converge, we call the sequence divergent.

Remark \(\PageIndex{1}\)
It follows directly from the definition, using the Archimedean property, that a sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to \(a\) if and only if for any \(\varepsilon>0\), there exists a real number \(N\) such that for any \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(n>N\), one has
\[\left|a_{n}-a\right|<\varepsilon. \nonumber\]

Example \(\PageIndex{1}\)
Let \(a_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\) for \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). We claim that \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=0\). We verify it using the definition.
Solution
Let \(\varepsilon>0\). Choose an integer \(N>1 / \varepsilon\). (Note that such an integer \(N\) exists due to the Archimidean Property.) Then, if \(n \geq N\), we get
\[\left|a_{n}-0\right|=\left|\frac{1}{n}\right|=\frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N}<\frac{1}{1 / \varepsilon}=\varepsilon. \nonumber\]

Example \(\PageIndex{2}\)
We now generalize the previous example as follows. Let \(\alpha>0\) and consider the sequence given by
\[a_{n}=\frac{1}{n^{\alpha}} \text { for } n \in \mathbb{N}. \nonumber\]
Solution
Let \(\varepsilon>0\). Choose an integer \(N\) such that \(N>\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^{1 / \alpha}\). For every \(n \geq N\), one has \(n>\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^{1 / \alpha}\) and, hence, \(n^{\alpha}>\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\). This implies
\[\left|\frac{1}{n^{\alpha}}-0\right|=\frac{1}{n^{\alpha}}<\frac{1}{1 / \varepsilon}=\varepsilon.\]
We conclude that \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=0\).

Example \(\PageIndex{3}\)
Consider the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) where
\[a_{n}=\frac{3 n^{2}+4}{2 n^{2}+n+5} \nonumber\]
We will prove directly from the definition that this sequence converges to \(a= \frac{3}{2}\).
Solution
Let \(\varepsilon>0\). We first search for a suitable \(N\). To that end, we simplify and estimate the expression \(\left|a_{n}-a\right|\). Notice that
\[\begin{aligned}
\left|a_{n}-\frac{3}{2}\right| &=\left|\frac{3 n^{2}+4}{2 n^{2}+n+5}-\frac{3}{2}\right|=\left|\frac{2\left(3 n^{2}+4\right)-3\left(2 n^{2}+n+5\right)}{2\left(2 n^{2}+n+5\right)}\right|=\left|\frac{-7-3 n}{2\left(2 n^{2}+n+5\right)}\right| \\
&=\frac{3 n+7}{2\left(2 n^{2}+n+5\right)}<\frac{10 n}{4 n^{2}}=\frac{10}{4 n}
\end{aligned}\]
To guarantee that the last expression is less than \(\varepsilon\), it will suffice to choose \(N>\frac{10}{4 \varepsilon}\). Indeed, if \(n \geq N\), we get
\[\left|a_{n}-a\right| \leq \frac{10}{4 n} \leq \frac{10}{4 N}<\frac{10}{4 \frac{10}{4 \varepsilon}}=\varepsilon.\]

Example \(\PageIndex{4}\)
Let \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) be given by
\[a_{n}=\frac{4 n^{2}-1}{3 n^{2}-n}. \nonumber\]
We claim \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=\frac{4}{3}\).
Solution
Let \(\varepsilon>0\). We search for a suitable \(N\). First notice that
\[\left|\frac{4 n^{2}-1}{3 n^{2}-n}-\frac{4}{3}\right|=\left|\frac{12 n^{2}-3-12 n^{2}+4 n}{3\left(3 n^{2}-n\right)}\right|=\left|\frac{4 n-3}{3\left(3 n^{2}-n\right)}\right|\]
Since \(n \geq 1\), we have \(n^{2} \geq n\) and \(4n>3\). Therefore we have
\[\left|\frac{4 n^{2}-1}{3 n^{2}-n}-\frac{4}{3}\right|=\frac{4 n-3}{3\left(3 n^{2}-n\right)} \leq \frac{4 n-3}{3\left(3 n^{2}-n^{2}\right)}<\frac{4 n}{6 n^{2}}=\frac{4}{6 n}.\]
Thus, if \(N>\frac{4}{6 \varepsilon}\), we have, for \(n \geq N\)
\[\left|\frac{4 n^{2}-1}{3 n^{2}-n}-\frac{4}{3}\right| \leq \frac{4}{6 n} \leq \frac{4}{6 N}<\varepsilon.\]

Example \(\PageIndex{5}\)
Consider the sequence given by
\[a_{n}=\frac{n^{2}+5}{4 n^{2}+n}.\]
We prove directly from the definition that \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to \(\frac{1}{4}\).
Solution
Let \(\varepsilon>0\). Now,
\[\left|\frac{n^{2}+5}{4 n^{2}+n}-\frac{1}{4}\right|=\left|\frac{4 n^{2}+20-4 n^{2}-n}{4\left(4 n^{2}+n\right)}\right|=\frac{|20-n|}{4\left(4 n^{2}+n\right)}.\]
If \(n \geq 20\), then \(|20-n|=n-20\). Therfore, for such \(n\) we have
\[\left|\frac{n^{2}+5}{4 n^{2}+n}-\frac{1}{4}\right|=\frac{n-20}{4\left(4 n^{2}+n\right)} \leq \frac{n}{16 n^{2}}=\frac{1}{16 n}.\]
Choose \(N>\max \left\{\frac{1}{16 \varepsilon}, 20\right\}\). Then, for \(n \geq N\) we get
\[\left|\frac{n^{2}+5}{4 n^{2}+n}-\frac{1}{4}\right| \leq \frac{1}{16 n} \leq \frac{1}{16 N}<\varepsilon.\]

The following result is quite useful in proving certain inequalities between numbers.
Lemma \(\PageIndex{2}\)
Let \(\ell \geq 0\), If \(\ell<\varepsilon\) for all \(\varepsilon>0\), then \(\ell =0\).

Proof

This is easily proved by contraposition. If \(\ell >0\), then there is a positive number, for example \(\varepsilon=\ell / 2\), such that \(\varepsilon<\ell\). \(\square\)



Theorem \(\PageIndex{3}\)
A convergent sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) has at most one limit

Proof

Suppose \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to \(a\) and \(b\). Then given \(\varepsilon>0\), there exist positive integers \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) such that
\[\left|a_{n}-a\right|<\varepsilon / 2 \text { for all } n \geq N_{1}\]
and
\[\left|a_{n}-b\right|<\varepsilon / 2 \text { for all } n \geq N_{2}.\]
Let \(N=\max \left\{N_{1}, N_{2}\right\}\). Then
\[|a-b| \leq\left|a-a_{N}\right|+\left|a_{N}-b\right|<\varepsilon / 2+\varepsilon / 2=\varepsilon.\]
Since \(\varepsilon>0\) is arbitrary, by Lemma 2.1.2, \(|a-b|=0\) and, hence, \(a=b\). \(\square\)



The following lemma is simple generalization of (2.1.2).
Lemma \(\PageIndex{4}\)
Given real numbers \(a,b\), then \(a \leq b\) if and only if \(a<b+\varepsilon\) for all \(\varepsilon>0\).

Proof

Suppose \(a<b+\varepsilon\) for all \(\varepsilon>0\). And suppose, by way of contradiction, that \(a>b\). then set \(\varepsilon_{0}=a-b\). Then \(\varepsilon_{0}>0\). By assumption, we should have \(a<b+\varepsilon_{0}=b+a-b=a\), which is a contradiction. It follows that \(a \leq b\).
The other direction follows immediately from the order axioms. \(\square\)



The following comparison theorem shows that (non-strict) inequalities are preserved ""in the limit"".
Theorem \(\PageIndex{5}\) - Comparison Theorem.
Suppose \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) and \(\left\{b_{n}\right\}\) converge to \(a\) and \(b\), respectively, and \(a_{n} \leq b_{n}\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). Then \(a \leq b\).

Proof

For any \(\varepsilon>0\), there exist \(N_{1}, N_{2} \in \mathbb{N}\) such that
\[a-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}<a_{n}<a+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \quad \text { for } n \geq N_{1},\]
\[b-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}<b_{n}<b+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \quad \text { for } n \geq N_{2}.\]
Choose \(N>\max \left\{N_{1}, N_{2}\right\}\). Then
\[a-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}<a_{N} \leq b_{N}<b+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}.\]
Thus, \(a<b+\varepsilon\) for any \(\varepsilon>0\). Using Lemma 2.1.4 we conclude \(a \leq b\). \(\square\)



Theorem \(\PageIndex{6}\) - The Squeeze Theorem.
Suppose the sequences \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\), \(\left\{b_{n}\right\}\), and \(\left\{c_{n}\right\}\) satisfy
\[a_{n} \leq b_{n} \leq c_{n} \text { for all } n \in \mathbb{N},\]
and \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} c_{n}=\ell\). Then \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} b_{n}=\ell\).

Proof

Fix any \(\varepsilon>0\). Since \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=\ell\), there exists \(N_{1} \in \mathbb{N}\) such that
\[\ell-\varepsilon<a_{n}<\ell+\varepsilon \nonumber\]
for all \(n \geq N_{1}\). Similarly, since \(\displaystyle \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} c_{n}=\ell\), there exists \(N_{2} \in \mathbb{N}\) such that
\[\ell-\varepsilon<c_{n}<\ell+\varepsilon \nonumber\]
for all \(n \geq N_{2}\). Let \(N=\max \left\{N_{1}, N_{2}\right\}\). Then, for \(n \geq N\), we have
\[\ell-\varepsilon<a_{n} \leq b_{n} \leq c_{n}<\ell+\varepsilon, \nonumber\]
which implies \(\left|b_{n}-\ell\right|<\varepsilon\). Therefore, \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} b_{n}=\ell\). \(\square\)



Definition \(\PageIndex{2}\)
A sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) is bounded above if the set \(\left\{a_{n}: n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\) is bounded above. Similarly, the sequence \left\{a_{n}: n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} is bounded below if the set \(\left\{a_{n}: n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\) is bounded below. We say that the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) is bounded if the set \(\left\{a_{n}: n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\) is bounded, that is, if it is both bounded above and bounded below.

It follows from the observation after Definition 1.5.1 that the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) is bounded if and only if there is \(M \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(\left|a_{n}\right| \leq M\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
Theorem \(\PageIndex{7}\)
A convergent sequence is bounded.

Proof

Suppose the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to \(a\). Then, for \(\varepsilon=1\), there exists \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) such that
\[\left|a_{n}-a\right|<1 \text { for all } n \geq N.\]
Since \(\left|a_{n}\right|-|a| \leq \| a_{n}|-| a|| \leq\left|a_{n}-a\right|\), this implies \(\left|a_{n}\right|<1+|a|\) for all \(n \geq N\). Set
\[M=\max \left\{\left|a_{1}\right|, \ldots,\left|a_{N-1}\right|,|a|+1\right\}\]
Then \(\left|a_{n}\right| \leq M\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). Therefore, \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) is bounded. \(\square\)



Definition \(\PageIndex{3}\)
Let \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence of real numbers. The sequence \(\left\{b_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is called a subsequence of \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) if there exists a sequence of increasing positive integers
\[n_{1}<n_{2}<n_{3}<\cdots,\]
such that \(b_{k}=a_{n_{k}}\) for each \(k \in \mathbb{N}\).

Example \(\PageIndex{6}\)
Consider the sequence \(a_{n}=(-1)^{n}\) for \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
Solution
Then \(\left\{a_{2 k}\right\}\) is a subsequence of \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) and \(a_{2 k}=1\) for all \(k\) (here \(n_{k}=2 k\) for all \(k\)). Similarly, \(\left\{a_{2 k+1}\right\}\) is also a subsequence of \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) and \(a_{2 k+1}=-1\) for all \(k\) (here \(n_{k}=2 k +1\) for all \(k\)).

Lemma \(\PageIndex{8}\)
Let \(\left\{n_{k}\right\}_{k}\) be a sequence of positive integers with
\[n_{1}<n_{2}<n_{3}<\cdots\]
Then \(n_{k} \geq k\) for all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\).

Proof

We use mathematical induction. When \(k=1\), it is clear that \(n_{1} \geq 1\) since \(n_{1}\) is a positive integer. Assume \(n_{k} \geq k\) for some \(k\). Now \(n_{k+1}>n_{k}\) and, since \(n_{k}\) and \(n_{k+1}\) are integers, this implies, \(n_{k+1} \geq n_{k}+1\). Therefore, \(n_{k+1} \geq k+1\) by the inductive hyposthesis. The conclusion now follows by the principle of mathematical induction. \(\square\)



Theorem \(\PageIndex{9}\)
If a sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to \(a\), then any subsequence \(\left\{a_{n_{k}}\right\}\) of \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) also converges to \(a\).

Proof

Suppose \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to \(a\) and let \(\varepsilon>0\) be given. Then there exists \(N\) such that
\[\left|a_{n}-a\right|<\varepsilon \text { for all } n \geq N.\]
For any \(k \geq N\), since \(n_{k} \geq k\), we also have
\[\left|a_{n_{k}}-a\right|<\varepsilon.\]
Thus, \(\left\{a_{n_{k}}\right\}\) converges to \(a\) as \(k \rightarrow \infty\). \(\square\)



Example \(\PageIndex{1}\)
Let \(a_{n}=(-1)^{n}\) for \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
Solution
Then the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) is divergent. Indeed suppose by contradiction that
\(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=\ell\).
Then every subsequence of \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) converges to a number \(\ell \in \mathbb{R}\). From the previous theorem, it follows, in particular, that
\(\ell=\lim _{k \rightarrow \infty} a_{2 k}=1 \text { and } \ell=\lim _{k \rightarrow \infty} a_{2 k+1}=-1\).
This contradiction shows that the sequence is divergent.

Since the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) is bounded but not convergent, this example illustrates the fact that the converse of theorem 2.1.7 is not true.
Remark \(\PageIndex{10}\)
Given a positive integer \(k_{0}\), it will be convenient to also talk about the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}_{n \geq k_{0}}\), that is, a function defined only for the integers greater than or equal to \(k_{0}\). For simplicity of notation, we may also denote this sequence by \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) whenever the integer \(k_{0}\) is clear form the context. For instance, we talk of the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) given by
\[a_{n}=\frac{n+1}{(n-1)(n-2)}.\]
although \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) are not defined. In all cases, the sequence must be defined from some integer onwards.

\(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2 n^{2}+2}{3 n^{3}+1}=0\).

Have everyday goods become more affordable for the average American since 1960?,"Yes, everyday goods have become more affordable for the average American since 1960. This is due to several factors such as advancements in technology, increased competition, and globalization. These factors have led to increased efficiency in production and distribution, which has resulted in lower prices for consumers. Additionally, the purchasing power of the average American has increased over time due to rising incomes and inflation. However, it is important to note that the affordability of goods can vary depending on the specific product and location.",True,https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/collect.htm,"

by David Pilgrim, Curator, Jim Crow Museum
As for me, I raced around the dumpsters collecting discarded ""White"" and ""Colored""
                     signs, thinking they would be some interest to posterity in a Museum of Horrors. --Stetson
                     Kennedy1
I am a garbage collector, racist garbage. For three decades I have collected items
                  that defame and belittle Africans and their American descendants. I have a parlor
                  game, ""72 Pictured Party Stunts,"" from the 1930s. One of the game's cards instructs
                  players to, ""Go through the motions of a colored boy eating watermelon."" The card
                  shows a dark black boy, with bulging eyes and blood red lips, eating a watermelon
                  as large as he is. The card offends me, but I collected it and 4,000 similar items
                  that portray black people as Coons, Toms, Sambos, Mammies, Picaninnies, and other
                  dehumanizing racial caricatures. I collect this garbage because I believe, and know
                  to be true, that items of intolerance can be used to teach tolerance.

I bought my first racist object when I was 12 or 13. My memory of that event is not
                  perfect. It was the early 1970s in Mobile, Alabama, the home of my youth. The item
                  was small, probably a Mammy saltshaker. It must have been cheap because I never had
                  much money. And, it must have been ugly because after I paid the dealer I threw the
                  item to the ground, shattering it. It was not a political act; I, simply, hated it,
                  if you can hate an object. I do not know if he scolded me, he almost certainly did.
                  I was what folks in Mobile, black and white people, indelicately referred to as a
                  ""Red Nigger."" In those days, in that place, he could have thrown that name at me,
                  without incident. I do not remember what he called me, but I am certain he called
                  me something other than David Pilgrim.
I have a 1916 magazine advertisement that shows a little black boy, softly caricatured,
                  drinking from an ink bottle. The bottom caption reads, ""Nigger Milk."" I bought the
                  print in 1988 from an antique store in LaPorte, Indiana. It was framed and offered
                  for sale at $20. The salesclerk wrote, ""Black Print,"" on the receipt. I told her to
                  write, ""Nigger Milk Print.""

""If you are going to sell it, call it by its name,"" I told her. She refused. We argued.
                  I bought the print and left. That was my last argument with a dealer or sales clerk;
                  today, I purchase the items and leave with little conversation.
The Mammy saltshaker and the ""Nigger Milk"" print are not the most offensive items
                  that I have seen. In 1874, McLoughlin Brothers of New York manufactured a puzzle game
                  called ""Chopped Up Niggers."" Today, the game is a prized collectible. I have twice
                  seen the game for sale; neither time did I have the $3,000 necessary to purchase it.
                  There are postcards from the first half of the 20th century that show black people
                  being whipped, or worse, hanging dead from trees, or lying on the ground burned beyond
                  recognition. Postcards and photographs of lynched black people sell for around $400
                  each on eBay and other Internet auction houses. I can afford to buy one, but I am
                  not ready, not yet.
My friends claim that I am obsessed with racist objects. If they are right, the obsession
                  began while I was an undergraduate student at Jarvis Christian College, a small historically
                  black institution in Hawkins, Texas. The teachers taught more than scientific principles
                  and mathematical equations. I learned from them what it was like to live as a black
                  man under Jim Crow segregation. Imagine being a college professor but having to wear
                  a chauffeur's hat while driving your new car through small towns, lest some disgruntled white man beat you for being ""uppity.""
                  The stories I heard were not angry ones; no, worse, they were matter-of-fact accounts
                  of everyday life in a land where every black person was considered inferior to every
                  white one, a time when ""social equality"" was a profane expression, fighting words.
                  Black people knew their clothing sizes. Why? They were not allowed to try on clothes
                  in department stores. If black and white people wore the same clothes, even for a
                  short while, it implied social equality, and, perhaps, intimacy.
I was 10 years old when Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed; we watched the funeral
                  on a small black and white television in my fifth grade class at Bessie C. Fonville
                  Elementary. All my classmates were black; Mobile was proudly, defiantly segregated.
                  Two years later, in search for a cheaper house, my family moved to Prichard, Alabama,
                  a small adjoining city that was even more segregated. Less than a decade earlier,
                  black people had not been allowed to use the Prichard City Library -- unless they
                  had a note from a white person. White people owned most of the stores. White people
                  held all the elected offices. I was part of the class that integrated Prichard Middle
                  School. A local television commentator called it an ""invasion."" Invaders? We were
                  children. We fought white adults¬†on the way to school and white children at school.
                  By the time I graduated from Mattie T. Blount High School most of the white people
                  had left the city. When I arrived at Jarvis Christian College I was not naive about
                  southern race relations.
My college teachers taught the usual lessons about Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth,
                  Booker T. Washington, and W.E.B. Dubois. More importantly, they taught about the daily
                  heroism of the maids, butlers, and sharecroppers who risked their jobs, and sometimes
                  their lives, to protest Jim Crow segregation. I learned to read history critically,
                  from the ""bottom-up,"" not as a linear critique of so-called great men, but from the
                  viewpoint of oppressed people. I realized the great debt that I owed to black people
                  -- all but a few forgotten by history -- who suffered so that I could be educated.
                  It was at Jarvis Christian College that I learned that a scholar could be an activist,
                  indeed, must be. Here, I first had the idea of building a collection of racist objects.
                  I was not sure what I would do with it.

All racial groups have been caricatured in this country, but none have been caricatured
                  as often or in as many ways as have black Americans. Black people have been portrayed
                  in popular culture as pitiable exotics, cannibalistic savages, hypersexual deviants,
                  childlike buffoons, obedient servants, self-loathing victims, and menaces to society.
                  These anti-black depictions were routinely manifested in or on material objects: ashtrays,
                  drinking glasses, banks, games, fishing lures, detergent boxes, and other everyday
                  items. These objects, with racist representations, both reflected and shaped attitudes
                  towards African Americans. Robbin Henderson (Faulkner, Henderson, Fabry, & Miller,
                  1982), director of the Berkeley Art Center, said, ""derogatory imagery enables people
                  to absorb stereotypes; which in turn allows them to ignore and condone injustice,
                  discrimination, segregation, and racism"" (p. 11). She was right. Racist imagery is
                  propaganda and that propaganda was used to support Jim Crow laws and customs.
¬†
Jim Crow was more than a series of ""Whites Only"" signs. It was a way of life that
                  approximated a racial caste system (Woodward, 1974). Jim Crow laws and etiquette were
                  aided by millions of material objects that portrayed black people as laughable, detestable
                  inferiors. The Coon caricature, for example, depicted black men as lazy, easily frightened,
                  chronically idle, inarticulate, physically ugly idiots. This distorted representation
                  of black men found its way onto postcards, sheet music, children's games, and many
                  other material objects. The Coon and other stereotypical images of black people buttressed
                  the view that black people were unfit to attend racially integrated schools, live
                  in safe neighborhoods, work in responsible jobs, vote, and hold public office. With
                  little effort I can hear the voices of my black elders -- parents, neighbors, teachers
                  -- demanding, almost pleading, ""Don't be Coon, be a man."" Living under Jim Crow meant
                  battling shame.

I collected many racist objects during my four years as a graduate student at The
                  Ohio State University. Most of the items were small and inexpensive. I paid $2 for
                  a postcard that showed a terrified black man being eaten by an alligator. I paid $5
                  for a matchbox that showed a Sambo-like character with oversized genitalia. The collection
                  that I amassed was not a sample of what existed in Ohio -- or anywhere; it was, instead,
                  a sample of what I could afford. Brutally racist items were, and remain, the most
                  expensive ""black collectibles."" In Orrville, Ohio, I saw a framed print showing naked
                  black children climbing a fence to enter a swimming hole. The caption read, ""Last
                  One In's A Nigger."" I did not have the $125 to purchase it. That was the early 1980s,
                  a few years before the prices for racist collectibles escalated. Today, that print,
                  if authentic, sells for several thousand dollars. On vacation, I scoured flea markets
                  and antique stores from Ohio to Alabama, looking for items that denigrated black people.
My years at The Ohio State University were, I realize now, filled with much anger.
                  I suppose every sane black person must be angry, at least for a while. I was in the
                  Sociology Department, a politically liberal department, and talk about improving race
                  relations was common. There were five or six black students, and we clung together
                  like frightened outsiders. I will not speak for my black colleagues, but I was sincerely
                  doubtful of my white professors' understanding of everyday racism. Their lectures
                  were often brilliant, but never complete. Race relations were fodder for theoretical
                  debate; black people were a ""research category."" Real black people, with real ambitions
                  and problems, were problematic. I was suspicious of my white teachers and they reciprocated.

A friend suggested that I take some of my ""elective courses"" in the Black Studies
                  Program. I did. James Upton, a Political Scientist, introduced me to Paul Robeson's
                  book Here I Stand (1958). Robeson, an accomplished athlete and entertainer, was also an activist who
                  believed that American capitalism was pernicious and detrimental to poor people, especially
                  black Americans. Robeson maintained his political convictions despite ostracism and
                  outright persecution. I was not anti-capitalism, but I admired his willingness to
                  follow his political convictions -- and his unwavering fight for the rights of oppressed
                  people. I read many books about race and race relations but few had as much impact
                  on me as Here I Stand. I read James Baldwin's novels and essays. His anger found a willing ear, but I was
                  troubled by his homosexuality. That is hardly surprising. I was reared in a community
                  that was demonstratively homophobic. Homosexuality was seen as weakness, and ""sissies""
                  were ""bad luck."" White bigots do not have a monopoly on ignorance. Progressiveness
                  is a journey. I had a long way to go.
I have long felt that Americans, especially white people, would rather talk about
                  slavery than Jim Crow. All ex-enslaved people are dead. They do not walk among us,
                  their presence a reminder of that unspeakably cruel system. Their children are dead.
                  Distanced by a century and a half, the modern American sees slavery as a regrettable
                  period when black people worked without wages. Enslavement was, of course, much worse.
                  It was the complete domination of one people by another people -- with the expected
                  abuses that accompany unchecked power. Slavers whipped the enslaved who displeased
                  them. Clergy preached that slavery was the will of God. Scientists ""proved"" that black
                  people were less evolved, a subspecies of the human race and politicians agreed. Teachers
                  taught young children that black people were inherently less intelligent. Laws forbade
                  the enslaved, and sometimes free black people, from learning to read and write, possessing
                  money, and arguing with white people. The enslaved were property -- thinking, suffering
                  property. The passing of a century and a half affords the typical American enough
                  ""psychological space"" to deal with slavery; when that is not sufficient, a sanitized
                  version of slavery is embraced.
The horrors of Jim Crow are not so easily ignored. The children of Jim Crow walk among
                  us, and they have stories to tell. They remember Emmett Till, murdered in 1955, for
                  an interchange with a white woman. Long before the tragic bombings of September 11,
                  2001, black people who lived under Jim Crow were acquainted with terrorism. On Sunday,
                  September 15, 1963, the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, a black church in Birmingham,
                  Alabama was bombed. Twenty-three people were hurt, and four girls were killed. The
                  black people who grew up during the Jim Crow period can tell you about this bombing
                  -- and many others. Black people who dared protest the indignities of Jim Crow were
                  threatened, and when the threats did not work, subjected to violence, including bombings.
                  The children of Jim Crow can talk about the Scottsboro boys, the Tuskegee Experiment,
                  lynchings, and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and they have stories
                  about the daily indignities that befell black people who lived in towns where they
                  were not respected or wanted.
Yes, many of us would rather talk about slavery than Jim Crow because a discussion
                  of Jim Crow begs the question: ""What about today?""

In 1990 I joined the sociology faculty at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan.
                  It was my second teaching position and my third ""real"" job. At that time, my collection
                  of racist artifacts numbered more than 1,000. I kept the collection in my home, bringing
                  out pieces when I gave public addresses, mainly to high school students. I discovered
                  that many young people, black and white, were not only ignorant about historical expressions
                  of racism, but they believed that I was exaggerating when I described the awfulness
                  of Jim Crow. Their ignorance disappointed me. I showed them segregation signs, Ku
                  Klux Klan robes, and everyday objects that portrayed black people with ragged clothes,
                  unkempt hair, bulging eyes, and clown-like lips -- running toward fried chicken and
                  watermelons and running away from alligators. I talked to the students about the connection
                  between Jim Crow laws and racist material objects. I was too heavy-handed, too driven
                  to make them understand; I was, that is, learning to use the objects as teaching tools
                  -- while, simultaneously, dealing with my anger.
A seminal event occurred in 1991. A colleague told me about an elderly black woman
                  who had a large collection of black-related objects. I will call her Mrs. Haley. She
                  was an antique dealer in a small Indiana town. I visited her and told her about my
                  collection. She seemed unimpressed. I described how I used the racist objects to teach
                  students about racism. Again, she was not impressed. Her store displayed a few pieces
                  of racist memorabilia. I asked if she kept most of the ""black material"" at her home.
                  She said that she kept those pieces in the back, but I could only see them if I agreed
                  to a condition, namely, I could never ""pester"" her to sell me any of the objects.
                  I agreed. She locked the front door, put the ""closed"" sign in the window, and motioned
                  for me to follow her.
If I live to be 100 I will never forget the feeling that I had when I saw her collection;
                  it was sadness, a thick, cold sadness. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, of objects,
                  side-by-side, on shelves that reached to the ceiling. All four walls were covered
                  with some of the most racist objects imaginable. I owned some of the objects, others
                  I had seen in Black Memorabilia price guides, and others were so rare I have not seen
                  them since. I was stunned. Sadness. It was as if I could hear the pieces talking,
                  yowling. Every conceivable distortion of black people, our people, was on display.
                  It was a chamber of horrors. She did not talk. She stared at me; I stared at the objects.
                  One was a life-sized wooden figure of a black man, grotesquely caricatured. It was
                  a testament to the creative energy that often lurks behind racism. On her walls was
                  a material record of all the hurt and harm done to Africans and their American descendants.
                  I wanted to cry. It was at that moment that I decided to create a museum.

I visited her often. She liked me because I was ""from down home."" She told me that
                  in the 1960s and 1970s many white people gave her racist objects. They did not want
                  to be identified with racism. They were embarrassed. That sentiment changed in the
                  mid-1980s. Several price guides devoted solely to racist collectibles were published.
                  The price guides helped create the contemporary market for racist collectibles. Each
                  new price guide showed prices escalating, and a national pursuit of racist items ensued.
                  Mrs. Haley's collection was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but she had no
                  desire to sell the pieces. They were our past, America's past. ""We mustn't forget,
                  baby,"" she said, without even a hint of anger. I stopped visiting after a year or
                  so, she died, and I heard that her collection was sold to private dealers. That broke
                  my heart on several levels. It bothers me that she did not live to see the museum
                  she helped inspire.
I continued to collect racist objects: musical records with racist themes, fishing
                  lures with Sambo imagery, children's games that showed naked, dirty black children
                  -- any and every racist item that I could afford. In the cold months I bought from
                  antique stores; in the warmer months, I traveled to flea markets. I was impatient.
                  I sought to purchase entire collections from dealers and collectors. Again, limited
                  finances restricted me to purchasing only small collections.

In 1994 I was part of a three-person team from Ferris State University that attended
                  a two-week workshop at Colorado College, in Colorado Springs. The conference, sponsored
                  by the Lilly Foundation, was devoted to the liberal arts. The charge to our team was
                  to introduce ""diversity"" into the general education curriculum at Ferris State University.
                  I traveled with Mary Murnik, a colleague, to all the local antique stores. Colorado
                  Springs is a politically conservative city, not surprisingly, there were many racist
                  items for sale -- some vintage, many reproductions. I bought several segregation signs,
                  a Coon Chicken Inn glass, three racist ashtrays, and many other items. I also bought
                  several 1920s records, all with racist themes, from a dealer who tried to talk about
                  ""the problem with colored people."" I wanted the records; I did not want the conversation.
                  John Thorp, the other member of the team, and I spent hours planning a strategy to
                  convince the Ferris State University administration to give physical space and money
                  to a room that would house my racist collectibles. It took several years but he and
                  I were successful.
Today, I am the founder and curator of the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Imagery at Ferris State University. Most collectors are soothed by their collections; I hated mine and was relieved to
                  get it out of my home. I donated my entire collection to the university, with the
                  condition that the objects would be displayed and preserved. I never liked having
                  the objects in my home. I had small children. They would wander to the basement and
                  look at ""daddy's dolls"" -- two mannequins dressed in full Ku Klux Klan regalia. They
                  played with the racist target games. One of them, I do not know which, broke a ""Tom""
                  cookie jar. I was angry for two days. The irony is not lost to me.
The museum will function as a teaching laboratory. Ferris State University faculty
                  and students use the museum to understand historical expressions of racism. The museum
                  also includes items created after the Jim Crow period ended; this is a valuable addition
                  because too many students were dismissing racism as a ""thing of the past."" Scholars
                  conducting research, mainly social scientists, also visit the museum. Only rarely
                  are children allowed in the room, and adults -- preferably their parents -- are encouraged
                  to accompany them. We encourage all visitors to watch Marlon Rigg's documentary, Ethnic Notions (Riggs, 1987) or Jim Crow's Museum (Pilgrim & Rye, 2004), a documentary I produced and Clayton Rye directed before entering
                  the room. A trained museum facilitator is there for all tours. Clergy, civil rights
                  groups and human rights organizations also visit the museum.

The mission of the Jim Crow Museum is straightforward: use items of intolerance to
                  teach tolerance. We examine the historical patterns of race relations and the origins
                  and consequences of racist depictions. The aim is to engage visitors in open and honest
                  dialogues about this country's racial history. We are not afraid to talk about race
                  and racism; we are afraid not to. I continue to deliver public presentations at high
                  schools and colleges. Race relations suffer when discussions of race and racism are
                  verboten. High schools that ""sincerely"" include race, racism, and diversity in their
                  curriculums increase tolerance for others. It is relatively easy to identify those
                  high schools that are afraid or unwilling to honestly examine race and racism. There
                  you will find a 1950s-like pattern of everyday race relations. Racial stereotypes
                  will dominate, though they may go unspoken. Inevitably, there will be a ""racial incident,""
                  -- a racial slur hurled, a fight blamed on ""the other,"" -- and there will be no relevant
                  foundation laid for dealing with the problem, other than hiring me or a similar ""diversity
                  consultant"" to restore order. The Jim Crow Museum is founded on the belief that open,
                  honest, even painful discussions about race are necessary to avoid yesterday's mistakes.
Our goal is not to shock visitors. A thick naivet'e about America's past permeates
                  this country. Many Americans understand historical racism mainly as a general abstraction:
                  Racism existed; it was bad, though probably not as bad as black people and other minorities
                  claim. A confrontation with the visual evidence of racism -- especially thousands
                  of items in a small room -- is frequently shocking, even painful. In the late 1800s
                  traveling carnivals and amusement parks sometimes included a game called ""Hit the
                  Coon."" A black man would stick his head through a hole in a painted canvas; the background
                  was a plantation scene. White patrons would throw balls -- and in especially brutal
                  instances, rocks -- at the black man's head to win prizes. A person living in the
                  21st century who sees that banner or a reproduction gets a glimpse of what it was
                  like to be a black man in the early years of Jim Crow.
That carnival banner reinforced the idea that black people were not as human as white
                  people. It alleviated white guilt about black pain; it suggested that black people
                  did not experience pain the way normal people -- whites -- experienced pain. It helped
                  legitimize ""happy violence"" directed against black people. It functioned as an ego
                  boost for the white hurlers. How many poorly paid, socially marginalized white people
                  expressed their frustration at the expense of ""black heads?"" The ""Hit the Coon"" game
                  and its cousin, ""African Dodger,"" were eventually replaced with target games that
                  used wooden black heads. You do not have to be a psychologist to understand the symbolic
                  violence. Not coincidentally, games that used black people as targets were popular
                  when the lynching of real black people was increasing in frequency. The Jim Crow Museum
                  has many objects that show black people being thrown at, hit, or beaten. We do not
                  have the carnival banner -- but I could teach a lot with one.
Some truths are painful

Anger is a necessary leg on many journeys, but it cannot be the destination. My anger
                  reached its apex when I read The Turner Diaries (1978), written by William L. Pierce, penname Andrew MacDonald.2 The book chronicles the ""heroism"" of white supremacists who overthrow the federal
                  government, win a bloody race war, and establish a social order where white people
                  rule. Black people, other minorities, and the white people who support them are brutally,
                  graphically killed. This book, arguably the most racist book produced in the second
                  half of the 20th century, has influenced numerous racist organizations, including
                  The Order and The Aryan Republican Army. Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 bombing
                  of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, was a fan of the book -- and his bombing
                  was eerily similar to bombings described in The Turner Diaries. I made the mistake of reading it -- all 80,000 words -- in one day, while I was
                  tired. It consumed me.
Pierce, who holds a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Colorado, bonded with
                  Nazis in the 1960s. That explains why he wrote the book, but why did it anger me so
                  much? I had, after all, a basement full of racist memorabilia. I was raised in the
                  segregated South. I remember the race riots on Davis Avenue in Mobile, Alabama. I
                  was familiar with the many ways that you can call me a nigger and threaten to hurt
                  me. The ideas in Pierce's book, though venomous, were not new to me. Yet, that book
                  shook me.

Near that time, I took a colleague's students into the Jim Crow Museum. I showed them
                  the ugliness, the Mammy, the Sambo, the Brute, the caricatured sores foisted on black
                  Americans. I showed them. Showed it all. And we went deep, deeper than ever before,
                  deeper than I meant to go. My anger showed. After three hours they left, all but two
                  -- a young black woman and a middle-aged white man. The woman sat, paralyzed, transfixed,
                  and stunned before a picture of four naked black children. The children sat on a riverbank.
                  At the bottom of the picture were these words: ""Alligator Bait."" She sat there, watching
                  it, trying to understand the hand that had made it, the mind that conceived it. She
                  did not say a word, but her eyes, her frown, the hand at her forehead all said, ""Why,
                  sweet Jesus, why?"" The white man stopped staring at the items and stared at me. He
                  was crying. Not a sob, a single tear stream. His tears moved me. I walked toward him.
                  Before I could talk, he said, ""I am sorry, Mr. Pilgrim. Please forgive me.""
He had not created the racist objects in the room, but he had benefited from living
                  in a society where black people were oppressed. Racial healing follows sincere contrition.
                  I never realized how much I needed to hear some white person, any sincere white person,
                  say, ""I am sorry, forgive me."" I wanted and needed an apology -- a heartfelt one that
                  changes two lives. His words took the steam out of my anger. The Jim Crow Museum was
                  not created to shock, shame, or anger, but to lead to a deeper understanding of the
                  historical racial divide. Some visitors to the museum say that I seemed so detached;
                  I am not, I have struggled to harness my anger and channel it into productive work.
Most people who visit the Jim Crow Museum understand our mission, accept our methods,
                  and continue the journey toward understanding and improving race relations. But we
                  have critics. That is to be expected. The 21st century has brought a fear and unwillingness
                  to look at racism in a deep, systematic manner. The hedonistic desire to avoid pain
                  (or anything uncomfortable) is counter to our method of directly confronting the ugly
                  legacy of racism. Moreover, there is a growing desire among many Americans to forget
                  the past and move forward. ""If we just stop talking about historical racism, racism
                  will go away."" It is not that easy. We may not talk openly about race, but that is
                  not the same as forgetting it. America remains a nation residentially segregated by
                  race. Our churches, temples, and synagogues are, in the main, racially divided. Old
                  patterns of racial segregation have returned to many public schools. Race matters.
                  Racial stereotypes, sometimes yelled, sometimes whispered, are common. Overt racism
                  has morphed into institutional racism, symbolic racism, and everyday racialism. Attitudes
                  and beliefs about race inform many of our decisions, big and small. ""Let's stop talking
                  about it,"" is a plea for comfort -- a comfort denied to black people and other minorities.
                  The way to move forward is to confront the historical and the contemporary expressions
                  of racism, and to do so in a setting where attitudes, values, and behaviors are critiqued.
Several visitors to the museum have asked, ""Why don't you have any positive items
                  in here?"" My answer is simple: we are, in effect, a black holocaust museum. I mean
                  no disrespect to the millions of Jews and others who died at the hands of the maniacal
                  Adolf Hitler and his followers. I hesitate to use the word ""holocaust"" to describe
                  the experiences of Africans and their American descendants because I do not want to
                  trivialize the suffering of Jews -- nor do I want to compare victimizations. But what
                  word should I use? Thousands of Africans died during the Trans-Atlantic slave voyage.
                  Many more lived under the brutal system of slavery, and even after slavery was officially
                  ended thousands of black people were lynched -- many ritualistically, by white mobs.
                  We have today many small ""white towns"" that were created because the black people
                  were ""driven out,"" victims of wanton racial violence.

When the Jim Crow Museum moves into a larger facility three additional ""stories"" will
                  be told. Artifacts and signage will introduce visitors to the wonderful accomplishments
                  of black scholars, scientists, artists, and inventors who thrived despite living under Jim Crow. Also, a ""Civil Rights Movement"" section will be added. There,
                  visitors will find images of protestors, with signs saying, ""I, Too, Am A Man."" Visitors
                  will learn about civil rights workers, many of whom are not found in history books.
                  This section can be conceptualized as a ""Death of Jim Crow"" period, though vestiges
                  of Jim Crow era thinking remain. Finally, there will be a room of reflection. I envision
                  a mural of civil rights martyrs, from all races, surrounding visitors as they ask
                  the important question, ""What can I do today to address racism?"" These will be positive
                  sections. We also plan to enlarge photographs of black people being ""regular"" people:
                  eating, walking, studying or simply living. These poster-sized images will be placed
                  near the caricatured objects so that visitors remember that the thousands of objects
                  that denigrate black people are distortions, mean-spirited exaggerations -- they are
                  not realistic depictions. There will be several kiosks with stories from people who
                  lived under Jim Crow.
Jim Crow was wounded in the 1950s and 1960s. The Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) ruled segregated schools unconstitutional. This hastened the end of legal
                  segregation, but it did not end it, as evidenced by the need for the Civil Rights
                  Movement. White people, especially northerners, were confronted with images of black
                  protestors being beaten by police officers, attacked by police dogs, and arrested
                  for trying to vote, eat at segregated lunch counters, and attend ""white"" schools.
                  The 1964 Civil Rights Act, passed after (and maybe because of) President John F. Kennedy's
                  death, was certainly a blow to Jim Crow.

One by one segregation laws were removed in the 1960s and 1970s. The elimination of
                  legal barriers to voting led to the election of black politicians in many cities,
                  including former bastions of segregation such as Birmingham and Atlanta. From this
                  period forward, white colleges and universities in the South admitted black students,
                  and hired black professors, albeit often a token number. Affirmative action programs
                  forced employers in both the public and private sectors to hire black people and other
                  minorities. Some black people appeared on television shows in non-stereotypical ways.
                  Significant racial problems remained but it seemed that Jim Crow era attitudes and
                  behaviors were destined to die. Many white people destroyed their household items
                  that defamed black people, for example, ashtrays with smiling Sambos, ""Jolly Nigger""
                  banks, sheet music with titles like ""Coon, Coon, Coon,"" and children' s books like
                  Little Black Sambo.
Jim Crow attitudes did not die; and in many instances, have resurfaced. The end of
                  the 20th century found many white people resentful of the ""gains"" by black people.
                  Affirmative Action policies were attacked as reverse discrimination against white
                  people. The slavery-era Coon caricature of black people as lazy, ne'er-do-wells re-emerged
                  as a depiction of modern welfare recipients. White Americans support welfare for the
                  ""deserving poor,"" but strongly oppose it for persons perceived as lazy and unwilling
                  to work. Black welfare recipients are seen as indolent parasites. The centuries-old
                  fear of black people, especially young black males, as brutes found new life in contemporary
                  portrayals of black people as thugs, gangsters, and menaces to society.

Black entertainers who capitalize financially on white America's acceptance of anti-black
                  stereotypes perpetuate many of these images. In popular and material culture, the
                  Mammy portrayal of black women was replaced by the Jezebel image: black women as hypersexual
                  deviants. The racial sensitivity that had been promoted in the 1970s and 1980s was
                  by the end of the century derided as ""political correctness.""
The new racial climate is marked by ambivalence and contradiction. Most polls about
                  race show a decline in prejudice among white people. There remains a heightened sense
                  that racism is wrong and that tolerating ""racial others"" is good; however, there is
                  a growing acceptance of ideas critical of and belittling toward black people and other
                  minorities. Many white people are tired of talking about race, believing that America
                  has made enough ""concessions"" to its black citizens. Some are rebelling against government
                  intrusion, arguing that the government, especially the federal government, does not
                  have the right to force integration. Still others wage personal battles against political
                  correctness. And then there is that segment of the white population that still believes
                  that black people are less intelligent, less ambitious, less moral, and more given
                  to social pathological behaviors: drug abuse, sexual deviance, and crimes against
                  property and persons. Martin Luther King, Jr., vilified during his life, is hailed
                  as a hero; black people as a whole are viewed with suspicion, sometimes alarm.

In the early 1990s I attended an academic conference in New Orleans. I searched local
                  stores for racist objects. There were not many. Ten years later I returned to New
                  Orleans. I found anti-black objects in many stores. This is disappointing but not
                  surprising. Brutally racist items are readily available through Internet auction houses,
                  most notably eBay. Indeed, practically every item housed in the Jim Crow Museum is
                  being sold on some Internet site. Old racist items are being reproduced and new items
                  are being created. Each year, Halloween USA produces monster masks by exaggerating
                  the features of Africans and African Americans.

In 2003, David Chang created a national uproar with his game, Ghettopoly. Unlike Monopoly,
                  the popular family game, Ghettopoly debases and belittles racial minorities, especially
                  black people. Ghettopoly has seven game pieces: Pimp, Hoe, 40 oz, Machine Gun, Marijuana
                  Leaf, Basketball, and Crack. One of the game's cards reads, ""You got yo whole neighborhood
                  addicted to crack. Collect $50 from each playa."" Monopoly has houses and hotels; Ghettopoly
                  has crack houses and projects. The distributors advertise Ghettopoly this way: ""Buying
                  stolen properties, pimpin hoes, building crack houses and projects, paying protection
                  fees and getting car jacked are some of the elements of the game. Not dope enough?
                  If you don't have the money that you owe to the loan shark you might just land yourself
                  in da Emergency Room."" The game's cards depict black people in physically caricatured
                  ways. Hasbro, the owner of the copyright for Monopoly, has sued David Chang to make
                  him stop distributing Ghettopoly.

David Chang promotes his product as a satirical critique of American racism. He is
                  not alone. AdultDolls.net is the distributor of Trash Talker Dolls, a set of dolls
                  with stereotypical depictions of minorities. Their best seller is Pimp Daddy, a chain-wearing,
                  gaudily dressed, black pimp who says, among other things, ""You better make some money,
                  bitch."" Charles Knipp, a white man, has gained national notoriety for his minstrel-drag
                  ""Ignunce Tour."" Knipp, dressed in ragged women's clothes and blackface makeup, adopts
                  the stage persona Shirley Q. Liquor -- a Coon-like black woman with 19 children. This
                  self-proclaimed ""Queen of Dixie"" has many skits -- each portraying all black people
                  as buffoons, whores, idlers, and crooks. Knipp's performances are popular in the Deep
                  South; however, he has been protested in many northern cities (Boykin, 2002). Shirley
                  Q. Liquor collectibles -- including cassette tapes, drinking glasses, and posters
                  are popular. When satire does not work, it promotes the thing satirized. Ghettopoly,
                  Trash Talker Dolls, and Shirley Q. Liquor skits and products portray black people
                  as immoral, wretched, ill-bred, cultural parasites. These modern depictions of black
                  people are reminiscent of the negative caricatures found more than a century ago.
                  The satire does not work but the distributors get paid.
Understanding is the principal thing. The Jim Crow Museum's holdings force visitors
                  to take a stand for or against the equality of all people. It works. I have witnessed
                  deep and honest discussions about race and racism. No topics are forbidden. What role
                  have black people played in perpetuating anti-black caricatures and stereotypes? When,
                  if ever, is folk art racially offensive? Is segregation along racial lines always
                  indicative of racism? We analyze the origins and consequences of racist imagery, but
                  we do not stop there.
I am humbled that the Jim Crow Museum has become a national resource -- and the museum's
                  Web site, an international resource. The Web site was created by Ted Halm, the Ferris
                  State University webmaster. Two dozen Ferris State University faculty have been trained
                  to function as docents -- leading tours and facilitating discussions about the objects.
                  Traveling exhibits are being conceptualized and built to carry the museum's lessons
                  to other universities and colleges. Clayton Rye, a Ferris State University professor
                  and filmmaker, and I created a documentary about the museum. John Thorp served the
                  museum well as its director until his retirement, as does current director Joseph
                  ""Andy"" Karafa. The museum is a team effort. A vision without help is a cathartic dream.
I see my role as decreasing. I have other goals, other garbage to collect. I have
                  collected several hundred objects that defame and belittle women -- items that both
                  reflected and shaped negative attitudes toward women. One day I will build a room,
                  modeled after the Jim Crow Museum, that uses sexist objects to teach Americans to
                  better understand sexism. That room will be called ""The Sarah Baartman Room,"" named
                  after a 19th century African woman brutally mistreated by her European captors. Her
                  victimization was a ""perfect"" illustration of the links between racism, sexism and
                  imperialism. There is an African proverb that says that we do not die until we are
                  forgotten. It is my intention that Sarah Baartman never dies.
Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""
                  In 2004, Carrie Weis, the Director of the FSU Art Gallery, and I designed and built
                  a traveling exhibit called, ""Hateful Things."" This exhibit has traveled to many universities
                  and museums teaching about the horrors of Jim Crow segregation. In 2005 we began building,
                  ""Them,"" a traveling exhibit that focuses on material objects that defame non-black
                  people, including women, Asians, Jews, Mexicans, and poor white people. Again, our
                  goal is to use items of intolerance to teach tolerance.
I will end with a story. One of my daughters plays on an elite soccer team, meaning
                  her practices are never done on time. One day I sat in the van with my other daughter
                  waiting for practice to end. Nearby several white boys were clowning in front of two
                  girls. They were all teenagers. One of the boys wore a blackfaced mask and he mocked
                  the mannerisms of ""street blacks."" He turned toward us and I immediately looked at
                  my daughter. She had lowered her head and covered her face. If you have a child then
                  you know what I felt. If your skin is dark then you know why I do what I do.

Why was it illegal for black people to attend the university of Alabama in 1984?,"It is important to note that this information needs to be fact-checked as it is not entirely accurate. The University of Alabama had been desegregated since 1963 when two African American students were admitted under the protection of federal court order. In 1984, it was not illegal for black people to attend the University of Alabama. However, racial tensions and discrimination continued to persist on campus, as well as in the surrounding city of Tuscaloosa.

Lessons Learned











The United States is unparalleled historically and ranks among the highest worldwide in its dependence on incarceration.1 Over five million people in total are under supervision by the criminal legal system.2 Of these, nearly two million people, disproportionately Black, are living in prisons and jails instead of their communities. Compare this to the figures of the early 1970s when this count was 360,000.3










Mass Incarceration‚Äôs Reach
The social, moral, and fiscal costs associated with the large-scale, decades-long investment in mass imprisonment cannot be justified by any evidence of its effectiveness. Misguided changes in sentencing law and policy ‚Äìnot crime‚Äì account for the majority of the increase in correctional supervision.4
Mass incarceration instigates numerous poor physical, psychological, and economic outcomes for the people who experience imprisonment, for their families, as well as for the broader community.5 Imprisonment leads to declining prospects for employment and results in lower earnings in the longer term.6 Food insecurity, housing instability, and reliance on public assistance are also associated with prior imprisonment.7 Children of incarcerated parents suffer tremendously; imprisonment of a parent leads to significant declines in academic and health outcomes for children.8 High levels of incarceration also destabilizes entire communities, leading to dissolution of informal networks that are known to serve as barriers to neighborhood crime.9 Trust in law enforcement deteriorates as community members experience elevated levels of victimization and the loss of community members, friends, and family members to incarceration.10










The Surge in Prison Growth
In 1972, the imprisonment rate was 93 per 100,000 people.11 The prison expansion that commenced in 1973 reached its peak in 2009, achieving a seven-fold increase over the intervening years. Between 1985 and 1995 alone, the total prison population grew an average of eight percent annually. And between 1990 and 1995, all states, with the exception of Maine, substantially increased their prison populations, from 13% in South Carolina to as high as 130% in Texas. The federal system grew 53% larger during this five-year period alone.12
The number of people in prison began a marginal decline beginning in 201013 and continued along this course for more than a decade, including a remarkable 14% decline in 2020 alone, which was principally caused by accelerated releases and reduced admissions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year 2022, however, marked the first year in more than a decade where the prison population rose again, by two percent, led by increases in 36 states and the federal government. 14 Mississippi alone raised its population of imprisoned persons 15% between 2021 and 2022.

In a global comparison, the United States remains a leader in per capita rates of incarceration. Though a handful of countries incarcerate a higher proportion of their population, the U.S. rate of incarceration is significantly higher than the rest of the world, including its closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico.

Probation and Parole
Probation and parole have expanded both in the absolute number and length of supervision for the past several decades.15

Racial and Ethnic Disparities
One in five Black men born in 2001 is likely to be imprisoned at some point in their lifetime.16 People of color remain massively overrepresented in prisons, accounting for nearly 7 in 10 people in prison. Systemic causes range from a history of racial and ethnic subordination to ongoing police tactics that unfairly ensnare people of color into the system, and also include charging and sentencing practices that create stiffer punishments for people of color. Recent estimates find that one in 81 Black adults in the United States is serving time in state prison.17

Offense Types
In 2022, more than three in five people (63%) sentenced to state prison had been convicted of a violent crime,18 as compared with 1970 when 30% of people in prison had been convicted of violence.19
Offense types among those convicted in the federal and state prison systems are presented below (Figures 6 and 7). Despite common misconceptions that federal prison is reserved for the most violent crimes, it is the case that roughly half (46%) of those sentenced to federal prison have been convicted of drug offenses.

Federal Drug Laws
Sentencing policies enacted under the banner of the ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù which began in the early 1970s and accelerated with the utilization of broadly punitive mandatory minimum and three-strikes policies, resulted in dramatic growth in incarceration for drug offenses. This is particularly evident at the federal level.
The Sentencing Reform Act of 198420 established the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) with the primary task of creating sentencing guidelines for the purpose of limiting the discretion of sentencing judges at the federal level.21 The guidelines went into effect in late 1987, at the same time that federal parole was eliminated, and federal prison sentences began their steep upward climb, especially for drug offenses.22 This climb was exacerbated by the passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1986, which imposed stiff mandatory minimums for drug offenses, including a five-year¬† mandatory minimum for the simple possession or sale of five grams of crack cocaine. In contrast, the mandatory minimum trigger for powder cocaine, a chemically identical drug to crack, required the sale of 100 times that amount. In 1986, people released after federal imprisonment for a drug conviction spent under two years in prison, but by 2005 people convicted of federal drug charges served an average of seven years.23 That increase was borne disproportionately by Black individuals: prior to the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, the average federal drug sentence for Black individuals was 11% higher than for whites, four years after its passage, that figure increased to 49%.24
In 2010, the US Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act in an effort to ameliorate some of the damage done by the law, reducing the sentencing cocaine disparity from 100-1 to 18-1.25 In 2019, the First Step Act applied the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act retroactively, and reduced other sentences for drug offenses. Approximately 4,000 people benefited from retroactivity of the law.26

Women
At the start of the era of mass incarceration, fewer than 6,000 women were in state or federal prisons.27 As noted in Figure 9 below, this level reached a high of 105,000‚Äìmore than 17 times the 1970 level‚Äìby 2015, followed by marginal but steady declines since. Still, 2022‚Äôs population figures are above those of the pre-mass incarceration era ‚Äì more than 82,000 women were imprisoned in state and federal prison. The growth in women‚Äôs imprisonment from 2021 to 2022 was more than double (4%) that of men (1.5%).

Life and Long-Term Imprisonment
Mass incarceration‚Äôs toll on human dignity is no more apparent than with the staggering proliferation of life sentences; today one in seven imprisoned people is serving a life sentence. Life sentences have consistently been included as a sentencing option, but their use expanded dramatically during the era of mass incarceration.28 Historically, life sentences came with the expectation of release; they were used to encourage good behavior among people who were incarcerated. Individuals were typically released in 10-15 years through parole or executive clemency.29
Figure 10. The Growth of Life Sentences, 1992-2020

Sources: Figures for 1992 obtained from: Maguire, K., Pastore, A. L., & Flanagan, T. J. (Eds.) (1993). Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics 1992. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Figures for 2005 obtained from: Liptak, A. (2005, October 5). Serving life with no chance at redemption. The New York Times. Data for 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 were collected from each state‚Äôs department of corrections by The Sentencing Project.
As depicted in Figure 10 above, in 1992, just over 9,000 people were reportedly serving life without parole and another 58,000 people were serving parole-eligible life sentences. By 2003, the number of people serving LWOP had more than tripled and parole-eligible lifers had increased 62%. By 2020,¬†six times as many people¬†were serving LWOP, reaching an all-time high of 55,945; the total population of people serving LWP rose 82% over these years.
Evidence shows that criminal careers are relatively short, in the range of 10 years,30 meaning that continued incarceration beyond this point produces diminishing returns on public safety, wasting limited resources that could be put toward effective crime prevention strategies. Long sentences also do little to deter criminal behavior because criminal engagement is often not rational and not carried out with a sophisticated understanding of the criminal code that determines punishment.31 Among youth and emerging adults, research finds that brain development impacts behavior. Sanctions that accommodate this reality incorporate reduced culpability for those who were young at the time of their offense.32
The growth of life imprisonment is echoed by the growth of long prison terms more broadly. Sentences of all lengths have expanded during the era of mass incarceration. The infamous ‚ÄúRockefeller Drug Laws‚Äù (1973), which mandated 15 years for possession of small amounts of marijuana and other drugs, was the first in a broad range of state-level mandatory sentencing schemes. In 1984, Washington state adopted the nation‚Äôs first ‚Äútruth-in-sentencing‚Äù law that required people to serve 85% of their sentences, and 27 states quickly adopted similar laws over the next 15 years. Fourteen states had eliminated parole altogether.33
Nearly one in five people in U.S. prisons‚Äîover 260,000 people‚Äîhad already served at least 10 years as of 2019. This is an increase from 133,000 people in 2000‚Äîwhich represented 10% of the prison population in that year.34
While Black Americans are vastly over-represented in the prison population, this disparity widens for those serving lengthy sentences. As depicted in Figure 11, in 2019, Black Americans represented 14% of the total U.S. population, 33% of the total prison population, and 46% of the prison population who had already served at least 10 years.35
Racial disparities in the criminal legal system are at their most extreme among people serving life sentences; Black Americans comprise 55% of those serving life without the possibility of parole, the most extreme life sentence.36

Voting Rights
In 48 states, a felony conviction can result in an individual‚Äôs loss of voting rights. The period of disenfranchisement varies by state, with some states restoring the vote upon completion of a prison term, and others effectively disenfranchising for life. As a result of the dramatic expansion of the criminal legal system over the past 50 years, restrictions on voting rights for persons with a felony have¬† diminished the political voice of many communities. As of 2022, over 4.4 million Americans were unable to vote due to state laws restricting voting rights for those with felony convictions. Among African American adults, five percent are disenfranchised compared to two percent of the overall adult population. Three out of four people disenfranchised are living in their communities, having fully completed their sentences or remain supervised while on probation or parole.37

Children and youth, especially Black and Latinx children and youth, have also been swept up in mass incarceration‚Äôs harmful policies. Under the guise of concern over rising violent crime in the late 1980s and early 1990s, policymakers quickly adopted and spread the fabricated ‚Äúsuperpredator‚Äù theory that described young Black boys as especially dangerous.38 Proponents of the theory believed that despite a young person‚Äôs age at the time of their offense, certain offenses should be handled in adult criminal court, rather than juvenile court. Lawmakers advanced policies that transferred tens of thousands of young people as young as 13 years old into adult court, jail, and prison systems that, by design, do not account for age.39
With two decades of experience it is now abundantly clear that these policies were counterproductive. In particular, holding youth in facilities with adults is associated with heighted physical and sexual abuse as well as higher rates of recidivism upon release40
Unlike the trends in adult prison and jail, youth incarceration figures started to decline sooner and by the turn of the century the number of youth in prisons and jails was steadily declining, amounting to an 83% drop overall by 2021.41 As illustrated in Figure 13 below, the year 2022 marks the first point in more than a decade that youth incarceration in adult prisons rose: in fact, the number of youth held in adult prisons jumped 50% between 2021 and 2022, a remarkable departure from the steady decline since 2009. Though the number of youth in adult prisons rose sharply, the number of youth in adult jails continued its decline from 2021 to 2022.

Lessons Learned
There are important lessons to be learned from this experience. The first is that adopting major policy shifts in an emotionally-driven political climate is never a wise course of action. Policymakers who promoted increased transfer of children to adult courts in the early 1990s, for example, did so at a time when youth (and adult) violence had risen precipitously. In retrospect, we know that the spike in violence was largely due to the emergence of crack cocaine drug markets, and was relatively short-lived.
A second lesson is that revising how we think about people who commit crime changes how we respond to their actions. Taken with an understanding of structural disadvantages that permeate American society leading to disparate economic, education, housing and health outcomes should motivate policymakers to aggressively pursue reforms in these areas while also investing in evidence-based individual-level prevention and intervention programs.
The life history of individuals in prison shows that, more often than not, they committed their crimes after major setbacks ‚Äî addiction, loss of jobs or housing¬† ‚Äî for which they received little support. There are few individuals in the prison system so dangerous that they can never be released back into the community. If we truly want to end mass incarceration and preserve community safety, we need to reprioritize public investments and policies with an emphasis on crime prevention and restoration of communities over punishment.

What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation?,"Intrinsic motivation comes from within an individual, and is driven by internal factors such as enjoyment of a task or personal beliefs and values. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, comes from external factors such as rewards or punishments. Intrinsic motivation is more sustainable and leads to higher levels of engagement and performance, while extrinsic motivation can be helpful in initiating a behavior or task but is less effective in maintaining it over time.",True,https://quizlet.com/354993083/chapter-12-questions-flash-cards/,"

How would you use a paragraph of text to explain what a stock market index is?,"A stock market index is a statistical measure that records the performance of a group of stocks in a specific financial market. It is used as a benchmark to help investors and analysts gauge the overall health of the market or a particular industry. The index typically tracks a group of companies representing a specific sector or market, and its value is calculated based on the performance of those companies' stock prices. Each index has its own methodology for calculating the value, but usually, it is weighted based on market capitalization, which means that the largest companies have a more significant impact on the index's value. The most widely recognized indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite, which track the performance of the 30, 500, and 3,000 largest public companies in the United States, respectively.",True,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp,"

Definition
The stock market is made up of investors buying, selling, and trading shares of companies, reflecting these firms' collective value and performance.
 The stock market as a whole is an exchange mechanism that helps investors buy and sell shares in publicly traded companies. Though you can visit the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and offices of the NASDAQ, these are just components in a broader marketplace. Trades are conducted mostly through electronic means between participants who are remote from each other. The mechanism is an excellent means for businesses to raise capital from investors. Additionally, analysts closely examine its traded prices for signals of economic strength or weakness.


Key Takeaways

The stock market is defined as the collective trading network involving company shares and their derivatives.
The stock market, is a central part of modern economies since it's where companies raise vast sums of money to accelerate successful startups, expand existing businesses, or consolidate operations and pay off debt.
Companies listed on stock exchanges must be public, meaning their shares are open not just to a select few but traded on stock exchanges and elsewhere. Public companies are subject to many reporting and transparency regulations.
Stocks are sold to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, but also those with far more modest means looking for income from a share of the profits, to sell the stock later at a higher price, or simply to have a say in how a company is run.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and individual state regulators oversee the U.S. stock market.

 The price of a stock changes based on the demand for shares from new investors who want to buy, or the supply of shares from existing investors who want to sell. Investors decide to buy or sell based on the company‚Äôs performance, economic conditions, the current price of the shares, and other factors. Not every investor makes decisions based on the same criteria, and what might not seem rational to one investor, will seem perfectly acceptable to another. This dynamic keeps shares trading hands and makes future prices difficult to predict.


 People purchase stocks for a lot of reasons. Some hold onto shares, looking for income from dividends. Others might think a stock will rise, so they snap it up, trying to buy low and sell high. Still, others might be interested in having a say in how particular companies are run. That‚Äôs because you can vote at shareholder meetings based on the number of shares you own.


 Both ‚Äústock market‚Äù and ‚Äústock exchange‚Äù are often used interchangeably, but they‚Äôre not the same. Traders in the stock market buy or sell shares on one or more stock exchanges, which are only part of the overall stock market. The major U.S. stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq.

  How Does the Stock Market Work?  
  The Stock Market Defined  
 The stock market is a vast, complex network of trading activities where shares of companies are bought and sold, protected by laws against fraud and other unfair trading practices. It plays a crucial role in modern economies by enabling money to move between investors and companies.


 Sometimes the best way to see how something works is to look at its parts. In that light, let's review the major elements of the stock market, from the companies selling shares to stocks to exchanges to the indexes that give us a snapshot of the stock market's health:


  What Are Public Companies?  
 Not all companies can offer stock to the public. Only public companies that have offered their shares for the first time in an initial public offering (IPO) can have their stock bought and sold on exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq. From the time a company starts planning its IPO through all the time its shares are sold to the public, it must meet stringent regulations and financial disclosure laws.


 The primary market could involve raising money and giving parts of a business to friends, family, and others in direct trades, making it the oldest way of dividing shares in a company. Since the primary market is where a company sells its securities directly, today it includes IPOs, follow-on public offerings, private placements, debt offerings, and other times when a company sells part of itself to raise funds.


 From then on, stocks are traded in the secondary market on exchanges or ""over the counter."" More than 58,000 companies worldwide are publicly traded today.


  What Are Stocks: Buying and Selling Shares  
 When you buy a stock or a share, you're getting a piece of that company. How much of the company you own depends on the number of shares the company has issued and the number of shares you own. If it's a small, private company, a single share could represent a large part of the company. Major public companies often have millions, even billions, of shares. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) has billions of shares in circulation, so a single share is just a tiny fraction of the company.


 Owning shares gives you the right to part of the company's profits, often paid as dividends, and sometimes the right to vote on company matters.


  What Is a Stock Exchange?  
 Once a company goes public, its stocks can be traded freely on the stock market. This means that investors can buy and sell shares among themselves. This is the secondary market for stocks, and most trading is done through stock exchanges. This part of the larger stock market dates to at least 1602 in Amsterdam, evolving since into some of the world's most complex institutions.


 Stock exchanges are organized and regulated ""places"" (much trading today is virtual) where stocks and other types of securities are bought and sold. They play a crucial role in the financial system by providing a platform for companies to raise money by selling their stocks and bonds to the public.


 The NYSE and Nasdaq are prime examples, serving as central locations for the buying and selling of stocks. There are major exchanges worldwide, such as the London Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Each has its own internal rules, and investors follow different national and local laws. These are meant to ensure fair trading practices and to keep investors confident in dealing there. They also provide transparency in the trading process, giving real-time information on securities prices, which is why it's so easy to find up-to-date stock prices on just about any financial news site.


 Stock exchanges wouldn't live up to their name, though, if they didn't offer liquidity, the ability to buy or sell stocks relatively easily. This means that during trading hours, you can buy a stock quickly or just as rapidly sell it to raise cash.


 Many stock exchanges also cross-list company shares, offering securities primarily listed on other exchanges. This way, companies can reach more investors when raising capital, and those trading with certain exchanges have far more options.



Though it is called a stock market, other securities, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are also traded there.
  Over-the-Counter Market  
 Stocks and other securities are also traded ""over the counter"" (OTC). These OTC markets are where you buy or sell stocks directly with another investor, typically without the same level of regulation or public scrutiny. OTC trading involves a network of brokers and dealers who negotiate directly over computer networks and by phone.


 This type of trading is commonly used for smaller, less liquid companies that may not meet the stringent listing requirements of the stock exchanges. This can make it more challenging for investors to get reliable information about the companies they are investing in.


  Other Assets Sold on the Stock Market  
 As part of understanding stock market basics, it's important to know that, in addition to common stocks, many other assets are traded through stock exchanges and OTC. These count, too, as part of the ""stock market"":


 American depositary receipts: Represent shares in foreign companies and are traded on U.S. stock exchanges. They let U.S. investors invest in foreign companies without dealing with foreign stock exchanges or converting over their currency.Derivatives: This is a broad category that includes options and futures, whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indexes. So, in derivatives trading, you're not directly buying or selling the actual asset (like the stock). Instead, you're trading something whose value is influenced by the changes in the price of an underlying asset.Funds: These include mutual funds, which pool money from many investors for a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities, and exchange-traded funds, which trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks and ""track"" or try to mirror how a sector, index, or theme of stocks is doing.Preferred stocks: These stocks generally provide a set dividend and, as the name suggests, have priority over common stock in getting a share of the profits or what's left over if the company goes bankrupt.Real estate investment trusts (REITs): These are worth mentioning to get an idea of the breadth of what counts as the stock market. REITs are companies that own, manage, or finance real estate. Investors can buy shares in them, and they legally must provide 90% of their profits as dividends each year.


 More loosely, while independent markets, people often talk about these as part of the ""stock market"":


 Bonds: These represent debt, and governments and corporations issue them to raise capital. Investors who buy bonds effectively lend money to the issuer in exchange for interest payments and the return of the bond's face value at maturity.Commodities: There are 50 major commodities markets worldwide where you buy raw materials like oil, steel, wheat, and coal directly or buy futures contracts based on where their prices might go.


  Investors and Traders  
 Those in the stock market include institutional investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds, that manage large amounts of money and often have a significant influence over the market since they are trading in large volumes. Retail investors buy and sell securities for their personal accounts‚Äînot for an organization. They can range from beginners to experienced traders, and today, most use online platforms. Another key group is accredited investors, high-net-worth individuals with the money and investing experience, so the SEC allows them access to more complex investments, like venture capital and private equity.


 Generally speaking, investors approach the market from a long-term perspective. They put money in stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, expecting their value to grow over time; these are not the quick trades you see in movies to get in and out fast. These investors are often more concerned with the fundamental strength of the companies or assets they invest in, such as their financial performance, market position, and potential for growth. They decide on investments after research and analysis or after getting recommendations from financial advisors while trying to build wealth steadily through a portfolio that increases in value over time.


 Traders, for their part, take a more short-term approach to the stock market. They aim to capitalize on the market‚Äôs volatility, trading stocks, options, futures, and other financial instruments within shorter time frames‚Äîfrom seconds and minutes to days and months. Traders often rely on technical analysis, which involves studying market trends, charts, and other statistical measures to predict future price movements. While trading can offer the potential for quick profits, it also comes with higher risks than long-term investing. Quickly buying and selling securities requires a sharp understanding of the market and a more active, hands-on strategy for trading.


  Role of Brokers  
 Brokers in the stock market play the same role as in insurance and elsewhere, acting as a go-between for investors and the securities markets. They are licensed organizations that buy and sell stocks and other securities for individual and institutional clients. Brokerage firms can be small boutique shops or multinationals offering investment advice, research, and wealth management services while executing trades for customers. Full-service brokers provide detailed financial advice, portfolio management, and personalized services, making them better for investors who prefer a thorough approach to managing their investments. Further down in cost, discount brokers provide a more hands-off experience and are typically preferred by investors who make their own trading decisions.


 Online brokerage firms have become increasingly popular with user-friendly platforms that allow investors to trade securities electronically at lower costs and more convenience. These platforms often have educational resources, analytical tools, and real-time market data. There has also been a rise in robo-advisors, automated financial planning services offered at a very low price.


 Whatever type of broker, they are all regulated by the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the U.S.


  Regulators  
 A significant aspect of the stock market‚Äîdictating what‚Äôs traded and how‚Äîis the regulations and regulators involved. In the U.S., the latter is the SEC, an independent federal agency set up in 1934 on the heels of the 1929 market crash and the travails of the Great Depression. The mission of the¬†SEC is ‚Äúprotecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.‚Äù


 The SEC enforces laws against market manipulation, insider trading, and other forms of fraud while verifying that public companies reveal any significant financial information investors should know when trusting a firm with their money by buying its stock. The SEC also oversees stock exchanges, broker-dealers, investment advisors, mutual funds, and public utility holding companies.


 In addition, the exchanges have their own requirements, such as filing timely (usually quarterly) updates to company financial reports and instant reporting of relevant corporate developments to ensure that everyone looking to trade has the same information.


 FINRA oversees brokerage firms and their registered securities representatives and is more focused than the SEC on protecting retail investors. Similar agencies exist worldwide, which is crucial given how the stock market is global and a calamity in one corner of the world soon reaches the other‚Äîit‚Äôs not just something that happens from a few buildings on Wall Street.


 While many countries‚Äô regulations differ significantly‚Äîthey answer to diverse populations and cultural expectations‚Äîgeneral rules are enforced to ensure fair practices, protect investors, and promote confidence in the broader stock market.


  How Stock Prices Are Determined  
 Textbook descriptions of stock prices tend to start off talking about investors and dealers coming together, and for there to be a stock trade, the buyer and seller must agree on a figure. But most investors find prices as they are listed in online brokerage accounts or online graphs of stock prices over time, not as coming from tough negotiations. That said, you do have to agree to buy stocks, and each investor or trader making this decision collectively shapes the demand for stocks, which, taken against the supply on hand in the market, produces the prices on our screens.


 The factors that influence these prices fall into two main types: fundamental and technical. Fundamental factors are rooted in a company's earnings, profitability from its operations, and the goods or services it offers. Meanwhile, technical factors relate to market sentiment and statistical analyses of historical market activity and stock price trends.


 High stock prices can indicate a company's success‚Äîor at least the feeling of buyers that they are doing well‚Äîbut they can also result from stock splits, dividends, and share repurchases. When a stock price drops, this doesn't mean that money is lost from the market as a whole. Instead, it signifies a decrease in the market value of the specific stock. For instance, if a company reports higher profits than expected, its stock price might increase as more investors want to buy shares, hoping for future growth. Similarly, economic events like interest rate changes or geopolitical issues can affect investor confidence and stock prices.


  Market Indexes  
 Most Americans first learn about the stock market through indexes since reporting on the ups and downs of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or S&P 500 has long been a staple for news programs to quickly get across the news about Wall Street. Indexes like the DJIA, which includes 30 large publicly owned companies, give a picture of the wider stock market. Indexes can be used to take a very wide shot of the market, such as with the S&P 500, representing the 500 largest U.S. public companies. There are currently 11 sectors for specific groups like technology, healthcare, or consumer discretionary companies etc.


 Indexes are important since they are used as benchmarks for stocks and portfolios. For example, if you're invested in technology stocks, you'll want to see how your stocks are doing against a tech index. You'll then have a better way to rate your returns.


  What Does the Stock Market Do?  
 The stock market fills several different roles worth highlighting:


 Corporate governance: Publicly traded companies follow stringent reporting regulations, which makes them far more transparent and accountable. This information allows investors to make informed decisions and helps maintain investor confidence in the market. It's also a boon for everyday Americans to gain a view inside major U.S. corporations since, without these transparency requirements, they could close down much of what we know about them.


 Economic indicator: The stock market's performance is often considered a gauge of an economy's health. Rising stock prices are associated with corporate profitability and economic growth while declining prices signal problems ahead.


 Investment opportunities: The stock market offers the chance to invest in companies and potentially grow a portfolio over time. The stock market has historically delivered returns outpacing inflation, making it a vital tool for retirement planning, wealth building, and financial security.


 Liquidity: The stock market enables investors to buy and sell shares of companies and other securities quickly when needed.


 Raising capital: Most importantly, the stock market offers a platform where companies raise funds by issuing stocks. This capital is essential for business expansion, research and development, and other corporate initiatives. By selling shares to the public, companies gain access to these funds without incurring debt.


 Resource allocation: By reflecting the collective judgment of traders and investors through the price of different companies, the stock market is said to help efficiently distribute capital to companies more likely to succeed and away from those that are not.


  Why Is the Stock Market So Important?  
 Now that we know the different parts of the stock market‚Äîwho, what, where, and how it works‚Äîwe can better understand why it's such a large part of our economy today. The meaning of the stock market can't be understated for how our world functions.


 When the earliest stock markets formed, the global economy was vastly different. These were eras when trade and commerce were primarily driven by physical goods, with industries like agriculture, textiles, and early manufacturing dominating the economic landscape. Stock markets at the time were fledgling institutions, primarily helping to finance expeditions and trade ventures, which is to say, the colonial enterprises taking goods and peoples from South Asia, the Americas, and Africa. These stock exchanges were already global investment operations. Yet, they played a relatively minor role in everyday economic life.


 Fast forward to today, and the stock market is considered central to the global economy, a change underscored by financialization and the increasing dominance of financial markets and institutions. This isn't just because over a million Americans work in finance. Modern economies are characterized by a complex web of financial transactions and instruments, with the stock market not just a barometer for economic health but also seen as critical for distributing and creating wealth.


  The Meaning of the Stock Market for Most Americans  
 Financialization has also mirrored broader socioeconomic changes. Today's stock markets are not just platforms for raising capital but have been tied into millions of Americans' retirement and investment strategies. This is why, at perilous times‚Äî2007 to 2008 and the pandemic being two major examples‚Äîthe U.S. government and Federal Reserve felt far more obligated than in previous eras to step in. This was not just to protect the wealth of a select few but because the savings of a vast swath of Americans were at risk. Not long ago, Americans hearing stock market news might be listening for indirect effects on their jobs‚Äîsay, to see how their firm is doing‚Äîbut now they are doing so more often for the direct impact on their own portfolios, including 401(K)s.


 Of course, many are paying off college, mortgages, and other debts or are otherwise too fragile financially to have a portfolio of stocks or other assets. Still, they, too, feel the reach of the stock market and its effects. First, the market drives funding for technological advances like the smartphones in our pockets or the medications we take, which require many billions of dollars for research and development. This access to capital has been crucial for companies pushing into areas like artificial intelligence or new medical devices, costing many times what a company could otherwise borrow.


 Moves in the stock market also affect the broader economy and, by extension, employment. Its performance can influence corporate decisions, influencing job creation (and the opposite as layoffs can boost a stock price), expansion, and overall economic growth. A healthy stock market generally correlates with a more robust economy. But it could also mean more capital in the hands of a wealthy few, increasing the property values of once middle-class areas in almost every major American city.


 The stock market also indirectly influences public services and infrastructure. Pension funds, a major part of government spending for employees at the local, state, and federal levels, are significantly invested in the stock market. The returns generated from these investments can influence the financial health of pension funds, affecting the retirement security of millions of people‚Äîbeyond the many more individuals who don't have pensions and are invested in the market directly through 401(k)s, mutual funds, and individual retirement accounts.


 What's the Difference Between the Bond Market and the Stock Market?
Worldwide, the bond market is larger than the stock market, with about $130 trillion in bonds outstanding and about $101 trillion in stock market capitalization, according to the last data available. The bond and stock markets serve different purposes and offer different risk-reward profiles for investors. In the bond market, investors buy and sell debt securities, typically issued by governments (local, state, and federal) or corporations. When you invest in bonds, you're essentially lending money for regular interest payments and the return on the bond's face value at maturity.The stock market involves buying and selling shares and derivatives (instruments whose value correlates in some way to particular stocks) of publicly traded companies. Investing in stocks means buying a piece of ownership in a company. Stocks offer the potential for higher returns than bonds since investors can get both dividends when the company is profitable and returns when the stock price goes up. They also have a higher risk, as stock prices can be more volatile.


 What Is an Alternate Trading System?
Alternative trading systems are platforms for matching large buy and sell transactions and are not regulated like exchanges. Dark pools and many cryptocurrency exchanges are private exchanges or forums for securities and currency trading and run within private groups.


 Who Helps an Investor Trade on the Stock Market?
Stockbrokers act as intermediaries between the stock exchanges and the investors by buying and selling stocks. Portfolio managers are professionals who invest portfolios, or collections of securities, for clients. Investment bankers¬†represent companies in many different ways, such as helping private companies that want to go public via an IPO or planning for mergers and acquisitions.


  The Bottom Line  
 The stock market is where shares of companies and other financial instruments are bought and sold. It's a network of all-stock trading where investors and traders buy and sell stocks. These trades determine stock prices, reflecting the company's perceived value and market conditions. The stock market is also where companies raise capital and from which investors can grow their wealth. It thus plays a vital role in the global economy. Even if you don't trade on the stock market directly, it influences the products you buy, the type of jobs available, and the retirement you might plan.

The survey found that the groups most likely to hold a current U.S. passport include Hispanic Americans, adults under 30, and people who have attained college degrees. It also found that Americans view a U.S. passport as more beneficial than passports issued by many other countries.  But first, who are the country‚Äôs passport holders? Among Americans, 43% have a passport, while 52% do not. (The rest are unsure or prefer not to say.) Adults under 30 are more likely than older Americans to have a current U.S. passport (53%); fewer do among 30-to 44-year-olds (46%), 45- to 64-year-olds (33%), and people 65 and older (46%). The more education a person has completed, the more likely they are to have a passport. Among people whose highest level of education is a high school degree or less, 24% have a current U.S. passport. The share is 39% among people who have completed some college, 64% among people whose highest level of education is a college degree, and 71% among people who have a postgraduate degree. There also are noticeable differences in U.S. passport ownership between people of different races. Hispanic Americans (55%) are more likely than white Americans (42%) or Black Americans (34%) to hold a current U.S. passport. Hispanic Americans are also more likely than Black and white Americans to have ever held a passport from a country other than the U.S.. While 20% of Hispanic Americans have, fewer Black Americans (13%) and white Americans (4%) have. The share of Americans who have applied for a U.S. passport or passport renewal in the past two years is 16%, including 21% of adults under 45. Among the Americans who have applied for a U.S. passport or renewal in the past two years, one-third (33%) say that it took longer to process their application than they were originally told to expect. A March 2023 update from the U.S. State Department said that there has been an ‚Äúunprecedented demand‚Äù for passport processing in 2023 as many Americans are returning to international travel. This has led to increases in processing time for passport renewals: Where it used to take six to nine weeks, the State Department now says it will take 10 to 13 weeks. Most (56%) Americans think this is an unreasonable amount of time for processing U.S. passports, though 21% say it is reasonable. Republicans (63%) are more likely than Democrats (56%) and Independents (50%) to find this timeline unreasonable. People who are 65 or older (68%) are more likely than younger adults (56%) to find the timeline unreasonable.   Luckily, very few (4%) Americans say they have ever had to cancel travel plans because of passport delays. And only 7% have ever lost their passport, though 11% of 18- to 44-year-olds who have ever had a passport have done so. The survey also asked Americans about the relative power of U.S. passports compared to passports issued from other countries. Canadian passports are perceived positively: 20% of Americans say it would be more beneficial to travel with a Canadian passport than a U.S. one and 36% say it would be equally beneficial. German passports also are well-regarded by many Americans: 18% think these are more beneficial than U.S. passports and 31% think the two are equal. The UK is the third country asked about whose passports are more likely to be seen by Americans as more beneficial than a U.S. passport than less beneficial.On the other end of the spectrum, passports from Iraq (52%), North Korea (52%), and Afghanistan (49%) are seen as less beneficial than U.S. passports by roughly half of Americans ‚Äî and more beneficial by 5% or less.‚Äî Linley Sanders, Taylor Orth, and Carl Bialik contributed to this articleRelated:Has COVID-19 affected Brits‚Äô and Americans‚Äô love of travel?The best places to visit in the United States, according to Americans who have visited themAmericans tend to support vaccine passports for international travelSee the results for this YouGov pollMethodology: The YouGov poll was conducted online on August 2 - 4, 2023 among 1,000 U.S. adult citizens. Respondents were selected from YouGov‚Äôs opt-in panel using sample matching. A random sample (stratified by gender, age, race, education, geographic region, and voter registration) was selected from the 2019 American Community Survey. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2020 election turnout and presidential vote, and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. The sample also was weighted by baseline party identification, which is the respondent‚Äôs most recent answer given prior to March 15, 2022, and is weighted to the estimated distribution at that time (33% Democratic, 28% Republican). The margin of error for the overall sample is approximately 4%.Image: Unsplash (Spencer Davis) Explore more data & articles Travel If cost and responsibilities were not a concern, would you rather go on a vacation‚Ä¶?  society  If cost and responsibilities were not a concern, would you rather go on a vacation to a place where‚Ä¶?  society  If cost and responsibilities were not a concern, would you rather go on a vacation to a place where‚Ä¶?  society  In-flight drama: Where Americans sit on airline etiquette  Travel  How do Americans feel about walking, driving, and other ways they get around?

Why do humans and animals have to breathe? ‚Äì Tennessee, age 7, Hartford, Kentucky


You need to breathe for the same reason you need to eat: It helps you make the energy your body requires. 
You probably already know that food is fuel for your body. When you eat, food gets broken down in your stomach and enters your bloodstream.



A plastic model of a mitochondrion.

From there, it gets delivered to your cells. Inside your cells are even tinier structures called mitochondria, which are the engines that power your entire body. Your mitochondria use the nutrients from food as fuel. But to turn it into energy, they need one more ingredient ‚Äì oxygen.
I am a biologist who studies animals and plants. All living things need oxygen, except for some bacteria and a few tiny animals that don‚Äôt. You might be surprised to learn how many ways there are to get oxygen ‚Äì breathing is only one of them.
Lungs and their linings
When you breathe in, your lungs temporarily trap oxygen, allowing it to pass through very thin surfaces in your lungs into your bloodstream. 



A CT scan of healthy lungs.

Because you need a lot of oxygen, your lungs need a lot of surface area to do their job. They achieve this by having millions of little air sacs lined with tiny blood vessels called capillaries.
If you could somehow flatten out all the capillary surface area in your lungs, it would more than cover the floor of an average classroom ‚Äì around 1,350 square feet (125 square meters). 
Getting enough oxygen
If breathing is kind of like eating, why can‚Äôt you just take three breaths a day?
One reason is that air on Earth is only 21% oxygen ‚Äì the rest is mostly nitrogen. That means you need to take five breaths just to get the equivalent of one complete lungful of oxygen. 



Your blood can carry only so much oxygen.

Also, when you take a breath, only some of the oxygen makes it into your bloodstream. Even though people and many animals make specialized proteins to grab and carry oxygen, there‚Äôs a limit to how much they can hold at once. To keep your body‚Äôs oxygen levels high enough to power all your cells, you need to keep breathing.
Of course, once you breathe in, you also have to breathe out. The gas you breathe out is called carbon dioxide. You can think of it as the exhaust from your mitochondria engines, the leftovers once the mitochondria burn oxygen and nutrients to release energy.
Other animals and plants
Most living things get oxygen without lungs. 
Many aquatic animals use gills, which are sort of like lungs turned inside out. Instead of a bunch of capillaries wrapped around air sacs, gills are a bunch of capillaries sticking out into the water. Just like in your lungs, the blood vessels take in oxygen from the water and release carbon dioxide.
Insects take in oxygen through a network of little air tubes just under their skin, sort of like the chimneys of a building. This system works because insects are small, so the tubes are already close enough to their cells to give them oxygen. When large insects need extra energy, they pump air through the tubes with their muscles.

Plants have little holes in their leaves called stomata. They open and close to let in air when plants need it. Plant roots need oxygen, too, which they usually get from the soil.
You may have heard that plants are the opposite of people: They breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen. That‚Äôs true because carbon dioxide is a crucial ingredient in photosynthesis ‚Äì the process plants use to make their own sugar fuel ‚Äì and oxygen is a byproduct. But plants‚Äô mitochondria also need oxygen to make energy, just like yours do.
Even though most animals and plants don‚Äôt breathe in and out the way people do, they all have ways of getting enough oxygen. Learning how organisms solve the same problem in different ways is one of my favorite things about biology.

How did Napoleon III become the stereotype for popular depictions of Napoleon Bonaparte?,"Napoleon III was the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and he was also the first president of the French Second Republic. He later became the Emperor of France and ruled from 1852 to 1870. During his reign, he tried to emulate his uncle's military and political successes, and he also commissioned many works of art and literature that portrayed Napoleon Bonaparte in a positive light. This helped to create a popular image of Napoleon Bonaparte as a heroic and charismatic leader, which has persisted to this day. Additionally, Napoleon III's own image and style of dress were often modeled after his uncle, further reinforcing the association between the two men.",True,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_Napoleon,"

Cosplay of Napoleon
Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, has become a worldwide cultural icon generally associated with tactical brilliance, ambition, and political power. His distinctive features and costume have made him a very recognisable figure in popular culture.
He has been portrayed in many works of fiction, his depiction varying greatly with the author's perception of the historical character. On the one hand, Napoleon has become a worldwide cultural icon who symbolises military genius and political power. For example, in the 1927 film Napol√©on, young general Bonaparte is portrayed as a heroic visionary. On the other hand, he has often been reduced to a stock character and has frequently been depicted as a short and ""petty tyrant"", sometimes comically so.


Literature, theatre, and film[edit]
Napoleon plays an indirect yet utterly important part in Alexandre Dumas' novel The Count of Monte Cristo. The novel starts in 1815 with Napoleon exiled on the island of Elba. Here we learn that he hands a letter to the protagonist Edmond Dant√®s to give to one of his chief (fictional) supporters in Paris - Noirtier De Villefort, the president of a Bonapartist club. Dant√®s is unaware that Villefort is an agent of the exiled Emperor and that the letter Napoleon handed him contained instructions and plans about Napoleon's planned return to Paris. Dant√®s' rivals include Mr. Danglars, his long-time unspoken rival and shipmate, who first reports Dant√®s to the authorities as a Bonapartist, and G√©rard De Villefort, the opportunistic son of Noirtier and staunch royalist, who, in order to protect his father from being outed as a Bonapartist, burns the letter and uses its former existence to frame Dant√®s and have him imprisoned in the Ch√¢teau d'If until his escape after 14 years and seeks vengeance upon those who wronged him.
Napoleon features prominently in the BBC Doctor Who Past Doctor Adventure World Game, in which the Second Doctor must avert a plot to change history so that Napoleon is victorious. In an alternate timeline created by the assassination of the Duke of Wellington prior to Waterloo, Napoleon is persuaded to march on to Russia after the victory at Waterloo, but he dies shortly afterwards, his empire having become so overextended that the various countries collapse back into the separate nations they were before, thus degenerating into a state of perpetual warfare. (This situation is made worse due to the intervention of the Doctor's old enemies the Players).
In 2013, Applied Mechanics produced Vainglorious, an epic, 26-actor immersive performance with Mary Tuomanen portraying Napoleon.[1]

When a nurse asks for his name, he replies ""Napoleon Bonaparte.""[3] A later update changed this to him saying ""You know who I am, Sonic! I am the genius, Dr. Robotnik!""[4]
H. Beam Piper's short story He Walked Around the Horses features a parallel universe in which both the American Revolution and the French Revolution were suppressed. Consequently, Napoleon does not rise to power and the Napoleonic Wars never take place. In 1809, he is described by a British general named Sir Arthur Wellesley as being a Colonel of Artillery in the French Army and a brilliant tactician whose loyalty to the French monarchy has never been questioned.

Napoleon was the topic of many sea shanties following his death, most notably the song ""Boney was a Warrior.""
Ludwig van Beethoven had originally conceived of dedicating his Third Symphony to Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. Beethoven admired the ideals of the French Revolution, and Napoleon as their embodiment. According to Beethoven's pupil, F. Ries, when Napoleon proclaimed himself Emperor in May 1804, Beethoven became disgusted and went to the table where the completed score lay. He took hold of the title-page and tore it up in rage.
The Ani DiFranco song ""Napoleon"" satirises the desire to continuously ""conquer""; more specifically musicians who sign with big labels, thus employing ""an army of suits"" in order to ""make a killing"" rather than just ""make a living"".
The Bob Dylan song ""On the Road Again"" from his 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home references Napoleon: ""Your mama she's hidin' inside the icebox/Your daddy walks in wearin' a Napoleon Bonaparte mask"".
Another Bob Dylan song, ""Like a Rolling Stone"", from his seminal album Highway 61 Revisited references Napoleon: ""You used to be so amused/At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used"".
The Kinks song ""Powerman"" from their 1970 album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One references Napoleon: ""People tried to conquer the world; Napoleon and Genghis Khan, Hitler tried and Mussolini too"".
The Bee Gees song ""Walking Back to Waterloo"" from their 1971 album Trafalgar references Napoleon: ""I wish there was another year, another time/When people sang and poems rhymed/My name could be Napoleon"".
Swedish Pop group ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 with the song ""Waterloo"", which uses the battle as a metaphor for a person surrendering to love similar to how Napoleon ""surrendered"" [sic] at Waterloo.
The Al Stewart song ""The Palace of Versailles"", from his 1978 album Time Passages, is filled with references and allusions to the French Revolution. One line specifically references Napoleon: ""Bonaparte is coming/With his army from the south"".
The Charlie Sexton song ""Impressed"" references Napoleon and Jos√©phine (from Pictures for Pleasure).
The Mark Knopfler song ""Done with Bonaparte"" from his 1996 album Golden Heart is sung from the viewpoint of a soldier in Napoleon's army. The song recalls the soldier's many battles serving in Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e.
The Tori Amos song ""Josephine"" from her 1999 album To Venus and Back is sung from the viewpoint of Napoleon during his unsuccessful invasion of Russia.
Iced Earth released the song ""Waterloo"" on their album The Glorious Burden, which details Napoleon's defeat at the Battle Of Waterloo.
Bright Eyes recorded a song called ""Napoleon's Hat"" for Lagniappe, an album released by Saddle Creek Records to raise funds for the Red Cross' Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.
The song ""Viva la Vida"" by Coldplay is loosely based on Napoleon's reign.

Recurring themes and stereotypes in popular culture[edit]
Napoleon's hat is a cultural icon.
Napoleon's height[edit]
A British political cartoon depicting Napoleon as short
British political cartoons of the period depicted Napoleon as a short man and the image of him as being short continues to be widespread today.[17] Confusion has sometimes arisen because of different values for the French inch (pouce) of the time (2.7¬†cm) and for the Imperial inch (2.54¬†cm).;[18] he has been cited as being from 1.57 metres (5¬†ft 2¬†in), which made him the height of the average French male at that time,[19] and up to 1.7 metres (5¬†ft 7¬†in) tall, which is above average for the period.[note 1][21] British Rear-Admiral Frederick Lewis Maitland, who had daily contact with Napoleon on Maitland's ship for twenty-three days in 1815, states in his memoirs that he was about 1.7 metres (5¬†ft 7¬†in).[22] Some historians believe that the reason for the mistake about his size at death came from use of an obsolete French yardstick.[19] Napoleon was a champion of the metric system (introduced in France in 1799) and had no use for the old yardsticks. It is more likely that he was 1.57 metres (5¬†ft 2¬†in), the height he was measured at on St. Helena, since he would have most likely been measured with an English yardstick rather than a yardstick of the Old French Regime.[19]
Napoleon's nickname of le petit caporal has added to the confusion, as some non-Francophones have mistakenly interpreted petit by its literal meaning of ""small"". In fact, it is an affectionate term reflecting on his camaraderie with ordinary soldiers. Napoleon also surrounded himself with the soldiers of his elite guard, required to be 1.83¬†m (6¬†ft) or taller,[citation needed] making him look smaller in comparison.
Napoleon's name has been lent to the Napoleon complex, a colloquial term describing an alleged type of inferiority complex which is said to affect some people who are physically short. The term is used more generally to describe people who are driven by a perceived handicap to overcompensate in other aspects of their lives.[23]

The Napoleon Delusion[edit]
Napoleon Bonaparte is one of the most famous individuals in the Western world. As delusional patients sometimes believe themselves to be an important or grandiose figure (see delusion), a patient claiming to be Napoleon has been a common stereotype in popular culture for delusions of this nature.

In the 1922 film Mixed Nuts, Stan Laurel plays a book salesman whose only volume for sale is a biography of Napoleon. When the character receives a blow to the head, he comes to believe that he is Napoleon and is subsequently admitted to a mental institution.[24]
In the 1925 Fleischer movie ""Ko-ko Nuts"", Koko the Clown goes to an asylum, where there is a whole Napoleon department for people who think they're Napoleon.
This clich√© has itself been parodied:

In the Bugs Bunny film Napoleon Bunny-Part, the actual Napoleon is dragged away by psychiatric attendants, who believe he is delusional.[25]
The song ""They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!"" was recorded by Jerry Samuels billed as Napoleon XIV. Some other versions of the song were made with lyrics referencing the Napoleon delusion (such as a Spanish version entitled ""Soy Napoleon"") or with the artist's name referencing a fictitious emperor.
In The Emperor's New Clothes, Ian Holm plays Napoleon who stumbles into the grounds of an asylum and finds himself surrounded by other ""Napoleons"" - he cannot reveal his identity for fear of being grouped with the deluded.[26] Holm also played a less-than-serious Napoleon in the 1981 film Time Bandits.
The Discworld novel Making Money features a character who believes himself to be Lord Vetinari, imitating Vetinari's mannerisms and entertaining delusions of grandeur. It is later revealed that the local hospital has an entire ward for people with the same delusion, where they engage in competitions to determine who is the ""real"" Vetinari.
In an episode of cult 1960s British TV sci-fi show The Prisoner called ""The Girl Who Was Death"", which unusually for the series was a light-hearted comedy tale parodying the spy thriller genre, the villain Dr. Schnipps (Kenneth Griffith) believed that he was Napoleon and acted accordingly, at one point asking the protagonist Number Six (Patrick McGoohan), ""You're not the Duke of Wellington, are you?""
In the first episode of season 2 of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles titled ""Return of the Shredder"" (1988), Scientist and Inventor, Baxter Stockman is seen in a jail cell with a man in Napoleonic garb spouting off dialogue in a French accent.
In an episode of Night Court, Judge Harry Stone (Harry Anderson) is placed in a jail cell along with a number of 'mentally disturbed' inmates all dressed as Napoleon. His court defence attorney (played by Markie Post) sees him and exclaims ""Oh sir. They put you in with the little generals"".
The award-winning video game Psychonauts features a mental patient, Fred Bonaparte, locked in an obsessive mind-game with his distant ancestor Napoleon, who is fighting for his mind.
In the Futurama episode ""Insane in the Mainframe"", Bender pretends to be a banjo-playing Napoleon in order to stay in a robot asylum.

Notes[edit]


^ Napoleon's height was 5¬†ft 2 French inches according to Antommarchi at Napoleon's autopsy and British sources put his height at 5¬†foot and 4 British inches: both equivalent to 1.4¬†m.[20] Napoleon surrounded himself with tall bodyguards and had a nickname of le petit caporal which was an affectionate term that reflected his reported camaraderie with his soldiers rather than his height.

^ Napoleon's height was put at just over 5 pieds 2 pouces by three French sources (his valet Constant, General Gourgaud, and Francesco Antommarchi at Napoleon's autopsy) which, using the French measurements of the time, equals around 1.69m. (""La taille de Napol√©on Bonaparte (Napoleon Bonaparte's height)"". www.1789-1815.com. 2002-11-25. Retrieved 2008-05-28.) Two English sources (Andrew Darling and John Foster) put his height at around 5¬†ft 7¬†ins, equivalent, on the Imperial scale, to 1.70m. This would have made him around average height for a Frenchman of the time. (""La taille de Napol√©on (Napoleon's height)"". La Fondation Napol√©on. Retrieved 2008-05-30. ""How tall was Napoleon?"". La Fondation Napol√©on. Retrieved 2005-12-18.) Nonetheless, some historians have claimed Napoleon would have been measured with a British measure at his autopsy, since it took place in St Helena, implying the 5¬†ft 2¬†ins is an Imperial measure, equal to about 1.58 meters. On the other hand, Francesco Antommarchi, Napoleon's personal physician, due to his hostility to the British, may never have used their yardstick to measure his emperor. (Antommarchi, F. G (1826).

        Health Care Home   HealthFeed   2012   12     The First Artificial Heart, 30 Years Later       



















 





Dec 02, 2012










                      
  Outside the University of Utah Hospital windows a blizzard swirled, inside another kind of power, not the least bit natural, was about to be set in motion. Thirty years ago on Dec. 2, 1982, in the darkest hours of the morning, cardiothoracic surgeon William DeVries, MD, carefully removed the ravaged heart of Dr. Barney Clark‚Äîa heart that tore like tissue paper due to years of treatment with steroids‚Äîand replaced it with the world's first permanent artificial heart. Known as the Jarvik-7 (named after former U of U physician and inventor Robert Jarvik, MD), this aluminum and polyurethane device was connected to a 400-pound air compressor that would accompany Clark for the rest of his life - all 112 days of it.
At the time, such a move was associated with the significance of putting a man on the moon or seeing Saturn's rings for the first time. It captivated the world. Others equated it with Frankenstein-like aspects, raising bioethical questions and concerns.
During the seven-hour operation, reporters from around the world set up their press headquarters in the hospital cafeteria, draining the coffee supply. The entire world held their breath, as Clark began his final journey, pioneering a new frontier of medicine involving the most symbolic of all our organs, the heart.
A dentist and ""tough old guy"" from Seattle, Clark was hailed as a hero as the world witnessed him weathering hard days and enjoying some good ones too. Celebrating his 39th anniversary with his wife, Una Loy, and their children was one of the good days.
Quite suddenly, on March 23, 1983, Clark passed away at the age of 62. At the time, the cause of death was stated as ""circulatory collapse and secondary multi-organ system failure."" He left behind a legacy. Clark's willingness to pioneer this new device infused life into mechanical heart device research and challenged all of us to open our minds and question, ""what is possible?""
Today, researchers at the University of Utah continue to push the boundaries of what's possible for patients like Barney Clark. ""Our Advanced Heart Failure program remains the only institution in the region actively studying novel, investigational devices to support the failing heart,"" says Craig H. Selzman, MD, surgical director of the University of Utah's Cardiac Mechanical Support and Heart Transplant program and the Lung and Heart/Lung Transplant program. During the Barney Clark era, the field was so young (the U barely had a heart surgery program), that transformative leaps such as implanting the first artificial heart could be made. Today, research in this field is more about incremental advances, smaller steps forward.
""What we are trying to do now, just like all of medicine, is to become more biologically based,"" explains Selzman. ""Engineering is important, but the devices we use are now very refined."" Today, patients suffering from heart failure can extend their lives with the implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) that weighs only ten ounces and has a diameter of 2.5 inches.
The next transformative advance is going to be in manipulating the biology of the patient and using heart pumps to assist patients in getting their heart to recover it's function‚Äîwith the possibility of removing the heart pump and avoiding transplantation altogether. Patients supported with LVADs provide a unique opportunity for us to learn more about not just the failing heart, but rather the factors that are involved with making the heart better. When applied to the vast number of heart failure patients, this information has the potential to be as transformative as the first implant of a total artificial heart in 1982.""
Q & A with William DeVries, MD, Cardiothoracic Surgeon Who Transplanted the First Total Artificial Heart
Did you believe the Jarvik-7 heart would work? I absolutely believed that the implantation was going to work; otherwise I would not have done it. I was confident in the device, and I knew that if I were in Barney's shoes, I'd have done it. As a matter of fact, the original Utah Artificial Heart [Jarvik-7] is almost exactly the same as the Total Artificial Heart being used today. I had personally already implanted about 200 artificial hearts in calves and they did really well. Plus, we had a strong team at the University of Utah.
How was success defined? According to the Utah IRB [Institutional Review Board], success was defined as Clark coming out of surgery alive. That shocked me. My idea of success was to give Barney some quality of life, get him up and moving around, and living a bit longer.
Why Barney Clark? We had spent quite a while looking for the right patient and Barney fit the criteria for the kind of patient we were looking for. He was over 50, had chronic heart disease, and had no other options available for him. The other systems in his body were working moderately well, and he had a strong support system, primarily his family. By the time I saw him, he was facing the last few weeks of his life and death was imminent.
When you first approached Clark, he declined. Why was that? Barney was a tough old guy, and as a successful dentist knew something about medicine. I had him watch me put an artificial heart into a cow. He saw the cow wake up and walk around. I really wanted him to understand what he might be signing up for. Barney said 'I have some problems that this cow doesn't have‚Äîit's healthy going into this, I'm not."" He decided not to go through with it. I admit, I was a bit disappointed but accepted his decision.
What changed his mind? He changed his mind on Thanksgiving. He was so sick that day that his son had to carry him to the head of the dinner table. Going to bed that night, he told his wife, he was going to go through with it. He explained to her, ""I've been kept alive for the last four years through all kinds of medicine and therapies that other people have given their lives to inform me; now, it is my time to pay them back."" That comment has really stayed with me, especially as I went on to help other patients whose reasons for the operation were different. Barney's reason was to contribute, to move science forward and to help others in the future. Once he made up his mind, he was quite determined to go through with it.
What was Barney's reaction when he awoke from the surgery? When he woke up and started looking around, I asked Barney, 'how do you feel, do you have any pain?' He said 'no pain' but that he was aware of a strong heart beat in his body for the first time in a long time. Then he looked at his wife, Una Loy, and said, ""I want to tell you even though I have no heart, I still love you."" He really became a hero for everyone, including the 350 reporters who were camped out in the hospital cafeteria that night and there every day that Barney was alive.
What was the last day like? On that 112th day‚Äî the entire period in which I had only left the hospital once‚ÄîI had just checked on Barney and he was up reading the newspaper. An hour later, he was unconscious and his blood pressure had plummeted down to zero. At that time, declaring death was based on one's heart stopping not on whether one was brain dead. His wife was with him, when we agreed to turn off the heart-pump machine. It was over. The easiest thing for Barney to do would have been to go home and die, but he chose not to; he was a pioneer who truly did give his life for something important.
What did you learn from the experience? We did a lot of trouble shooting over those 112 days. We'd never had a person on this device before, so we faced a lot of new issues ranging from dealing with anti-coagulation measures to how best to deter infection. We worried about whether he should be on antibiotics the whole time. The hospital really rallied around us and we had these huge, collaborative meetings with people representing specialties from throughout the U, all helping us decide how best to care for Barney. In the end, we probably treated him with too many antibiotics and he got an infection‚ÄîPseudomembranous Colitis.
What was the most valuable result? The favorableness for this type of new technology jumped. If it had not worked, it may very well have slowed down the progression in this area. Instead, within the next ten years, 236 Utah Artificial Heart implants had been implanted around the world. Today, artificial implants [LVADs] are being used primarily as a bridge to transplants‚Äîsecuring people time until a heart is available.
What did this mean for you personally? That whole experience really defined my life and career. I've learned, above all, that the patient is the most important person and that relationship needs to be the focus. That was a key lesson for me as a doctor; developing a strong communication bond with the patient was a source to key information and more likely meant success. This meant that spending time with my patients, really listening, and reciprocating with openness and honestly was key.
With all the eyes of the world looking at me in 1982, I was very glad to have someone like Barney Clark and his wife in my corner. He really did give his life to thousands of people. All medicine is like that‚Äîit came from someone who dared to do something like this.

 Who is Tchaikovsky?










Meet the Russian Composer Behind Ballet‚Äôs Most Beloved Scores

Even at the age of six, Tchaikovsky loved music so much that he was prepared to bleed for it‚Äîliterally. He practiced piano every chance he got, and when he couldn‚Äôt, he would tap out the music he had made up in his head on the house‚Äôs windowpanes. One time, he tapped so hard that he broke the window glass, cutting himself badly. But Tchaikovsky could not be lured away from the music.
Composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky
Born in Kamsko-Votinsk, Russia on May 7, 1840, Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a bright child; he could read Russian, French, and German by the time he was six. After attending boarding school, he studied law and mathematics and got a job as a clerk working in the Ministry of Justice. But after four years, he quit to follow his original love: music. Soon after he began going to music school full-time and studying composition, he was invited to teach classes.
The beautiful music that Tchaikovsky would create over the next 25 years made him one of the most popular of all the Russian composers. His works include nine operas, six symphonies, four concertos, three string quartets, and numerous songs, suites, and overtures. Yet, it is for his ballet scores that he is most remembered. Tchaikovsky may have only written three ballets, but they are the three most famous ballets of all time: Nutcracker, Swan Lake, and¬†The Sleeping Beauty.

Swan Lake
In 1875, Moscow Imperial Theatre director Vladimir Patrovich Begichev commissioned Tchaikovsky to compose the score for Swan Lake. Drawing from established ballet composers Ludwig Minkus, L√©o Delibes, and Adolphe Adam, among others, as well as some of his own previous compositions, Tchaikovsky finished the score in just under a year. However, rehearsals did not go smoothly. Choreographer Julius Reisinger dubbed some of Tchaikovsky‚Äôs music ‚Äúundanceable,‚Äù and Tchaikovsky had to fight to have the sections put back into the ballet. When the ballet premiered on March 4, 1877, critics wrote that the music was too complicated, noisy and ‚ÄúWagnerian.‚Äù

Nutcracker
The iconic score for Nutcracker was composed in bits and pieces as Tchaikovsky traveled across France and the United States in 1891, and orchestrated from January to March of the following year. Tchaikovsky was a fan of the Nutcracker story originally penned by E.T.A. Hoffmann, but not as enthusiastic about the Candyland setting of the ballet that Marius Petipa had choreographed. It was hard for him to compose around it. Still, Tchaikovsky worked through this setback and the final Nutcracker score is a masterpiece that continues to be appreciated by audiences today just as enthusiastically as when it was first introduced.



Ôªø



Less than a year after the premiere of this ballet, Tchaikovsky died unexpectedly. He was only 53, and had just completed his sixth symphony, which he felt was the best piece of music he ever created. It was in the years after his death that Tchaikovsky‚Äôs music became the cultural touchstone that it is today.

Following this advice can help reduce your risk of getting sick. Not all risks are listed here.It's best to talk to a healthcare provider or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before your trip to get personalized health advice. Even if your travel date is coming up soon, it's still worthwhile to make an appointment.Routine vaccines
Make sure your routine vaccinations are up-to-date before you travel, no matter where you‚Äôre going.
These may include vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, varicella (chickenpox), meningococcal disease, seasonal flu, and others.
Provincial and Territorial Immunization Information
Pre-travel vaccines and medications
When travelling in this destination, you might be at risk for diseases that can be prevented with vaccines or medications. Talk to a travel health care provider about which ones are right for you based on your travel plans.
The highlights below will also tell you if your destination may require that vaccine for entering or exiting.Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements Yellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.
Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.
Risk

There is no risk of yellow fever in this country.

Country Entry Requirement*

Proof of vaccination is not required to enter this country.

Recommendation

Vaccination is not recommended.

* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.
About Yellow Fever
Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres in CanadaHepatitis AThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.
¬†
Practise¬†safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present. Measles Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.
Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.
Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.Hepatitis B¬†Hepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus.¬† Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.COVID-19Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.
It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally. 
Before travelling, verify your destination‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19. Influenza¬†The best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling. ¬†
¬†The flu occurs worldwide.¬†

¬†In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to¬† ¬†April.
¬†In the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and¬† ¬†October.
¬†In the tropics, there is flu activity year round.¬†

The flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.
The flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.Malaria  Malaria¬†is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.¬†There is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.¬†
Antimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.¬†¬†Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:¬†‚Ä¢ Cover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.¬†‚Ä¢ Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.‚Ä¢ Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.¬†‚Ä¢ Wear permethrin-treated clothing.¬†¬†If you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.¬†Rabies In this destination, rabies is carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.
If you are bitten or scratched by an animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. Rabies treatment is often available in this destination.¬†
Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).¬†Safe food and water precautions
Eating or drinking unsafe food or water, or swimming in contaminated water can make you sick while travelling. Take precautions by following these tips:

Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it (only eat food that is prepared safely)
Avoid, if possible, getting water in your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming in freshwater (like streams, lakes, or canals), especially after heavy rain or flooding - the water might look clean but can still be contaminated¬†
Don‚Äôt swallow water when bathing, showering, swimming in pools, or using hot tubs¬†

Eat and drink safely abroadTravellers' diarrheaTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.
Risk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.
The most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.Typhoid Typhoid¬†is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children,¬†travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.
Travellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.¬†¬†Salmonellosis Salmonellosis is a common illness among travellers to this country. It can be spread through contaminated food or beverages, such as raw or undercooked poultry and eggs, as well as fruits or vegetables.
Practice safe food and water precautions. This includes only eating food that is properly cooked and still hot when served.
Pregnant women, children under 5 years of age, those over 60 years of age, and those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill.
Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella have been reported among Canadian travellers returning from Mexico. These strains of Salmonella do not respond to some of the recommended antibiotics if treatment is needed.
Most people recover on their own without medical treatment and from proper rehydration (drinking lots of fluids).

Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.

Travellers with severe symptoms should consult a health care professional as soon as possible.Tick and insect bite prevention
Many diseases are spread by bites from infected ticks and insects like mosquitoes, fleas, or flies. Before you travel, find out what types of ticks or insects are in the area, when they‚Äôre most active, and what diseases they can spread.
To protect yourself from bites:

use an approved bug spray (insect repellent) on exposed skin
wear light-coloured, loose clothing made of tightly woven materials like nylon or polyester
wear socks and closed-toe shoes

Insect bite and pest preventionChikungunyaDengue  
In this country,¬†dengue¬†is a risk to travellers. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.
Dengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.
The level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.
Mosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.
Protect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication available in Canada to prevent dengue.¬†

Learn more:DengueInsect bite and pest preventionZika virus Zika virus is a risk in this country.¬†
Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.
During your trip:

Prevent mosquito bites at all times.
Use condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.

If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.¬†
For more information, see Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.American trypanosomiasisAmerican trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease)¬†is a risk in this country. It is caused by a parasite spread by infected triatomine bugs. The infection can be inactive for decades, but humans can eventually develop complications causing disability and even death.
Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from triatomine bugs, which are active at night, by using mosquito nets if staying in poorly-constructed housing. There is no vaccine available for Chagas disease.Animal precautions
Some infections, like rabies and bird flu (avian influenza), can be spread from animals to humans. Certain activities can increase your chances of coming into contact with animals, like:

travelling in rural or forested areas
camping, hiking, or visiting caves
visiting places where live animals are sold or killed for food, like wet markets

To reduce your risk of getting sick, avoid contact with animals like stray dogs, livestock (such as pigs and cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats. Avoid eating undercooked meat.
Make sure to closely watch children; they are more likely to try to touch animals.Avian InfluenzaHuman cases of avian influenza have been reported in this destination. Avian influenza¬†is a viral infection that can spread quickly and easily among birds and in rare cases it can infect mammals, including people. The risk is low for most travellers.
Avoid contact with birds, including wild, farm, and backyard birds (alive or dead) and surfaces that may have bird droppings on them. Ensure all poultry dishes, including eggs and wild game, are properly cooked.
Travellers with a higher risk of exposure include those:¬†

visiting live bird/animal markets or poultry farms
working with poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks)
hunting, de-feathering, field dressing and butchering wild birds and wild mammals
working with wild birds for activities such as research, conservation, or rehabilitation
working with wild mammals, especially those that eat wild birds (e.g., foxes)

All eligible people are encouraged to get the seasonal influenza shot, which will protect them against human influenza viruses. While the seasonal influenza shot does not prevent infection with avian influenza, it can reduce the chance of getting sick with human and avian influenza viruses at the same time.Person-to-person infections
When travelling, you can reduce your risk of getting or spreading respiratory infections, like the flu or COVID-19, by:

staying at your accommodation and limiting contact with others if you‚Äôre sick
wearing a well-fitting mask, especially:¬†

if you‚Äôre sick and need to be around others¬†
when you‚Äôre at large indoor events or in crowded settings, like sporting events, concerts, and airports


cleaning your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, not your hands

Mass gatherings (large-scale events)Clean your hands to help reduce the spread of infectious diseasesRespiratory infectious diseases: How to reduce the spread with personal protective measures
To lower your risk of getting sexually transmissible infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox, you can:

get vaccinated against mpox if you‚Äôre eligible
have fewer sexual partners
use protection during sexual activity, like condoms and dental dams.

Mpox vaccinesSexual health and travelHIV and AIDS: Travel health adviceMedical services and facilitiesThe quality of care varies greatly throughout the country. Good health care is available in private hospitals and clinics in major cities, but health care services are limited in rural areas.Health care from private hospitals and clinics is generally expensive. Most private facilities don‚Äôt deal directly with medical insurance companies and will require payment with a credit card in advance or a bank transfer/direct deposit.Mental health services are extremely limited in Mexico, particularly outside of Mexico City. Services and treatment standards may differ substantially from those in Canada.Most healthcare providers speak Spanish.Emergency and ambulance services are widely available. Response times vary widely depending on traffic and availability of services and may be slow in rural areas.Medical evacuation can be very expensive, and you may need it in case of serious illness or injury.Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.Health and safety outside CanadaContaminated beachesStorm run-off, sewage or oil may affect the water quality at some beaches.

                                                                                                By Nicole San Roman and Allan Stone

The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù Matters: Setting Successful Goals

New year, new you? January is a great time to set goals for the year ahead, things like exercising more, eating healthier, or maybe taking more time for yourself. They‚Äôre all good resolutions but to set yourself up for success, the focus shouldn‚Äôt be on what your goals are, but instead why you are setting them in the first place.
Jennifer Crawford, PhD, is a clinical psychologist and assistant professor in The University of New Mexico‚Äôs Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department.








                    If we don't care about why we're doing it, then it makes it really difficult to stick with that new behavior or a new habit. And it's way easier to change things up when you know your why. What is the why?
                    

‚Äî Jennifer Crawford, PhD, UNM Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences 








‚ÄúSometimes we set goals because we think it‚Äôs something that someone else expects or what we should expect of ourselves,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut really, if we don't care about why we're doing it, then it makes it really difficult to stick with that new behavior or a new habit. And it's way easier to change things up when you know your why. What is the why?‚Äù
If you're hoping to make a change in 2024 for some part of your wellness, physical, emotional health, or mental well-being, Crawford says there are some specific steps you can take to make sure that your goals are a good fit for you and therefore more achievable.







                The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù Matters: Setting Successful Goals
            









                    What's key to goal setting is to think about what's most important to you. How does the goal connect with something you really care about deep down, or the kind of person you want to be, or the kind of life you want to have?
                    

‚Äî Jennifer Crawford, PhD, UNM Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences 








How do you set reasonable goals?
When it comes to setting reasonable goals, Crawford says it‚Äôs all about being SMART.
‚ÄúThat stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time bound,‚Äù Crawford says.
‚ÄúWhat's key to goal setting is to think about what's most important to you. So how does the goal connect with something you really care about deep down, or the kind of person you want to be, or the kind of life you want to have? In that way, reasonable goals become easier to commit to.‚Äù
Crawford says setting SMART goals is a way of making sure that a goal isn't too big and therefore maybe more difficult to achieve. It helps you to define a goal in a way that makes it more reasonable.







SMART Goal Example 



Maybe your goal is to move your body more this year to better manage work stress. A relevant SMART goal may be to: walk in my neighborhood for 30 mins after I get home from work, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, starting tomorrow for the next 4 weeks.
That goal Specific and Measurable: walking for 30 minutes a day.
Attainable: Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Relevant: walking will help to reduce stress.
Time Bound: starting tomorrow for 4 weeks.









How do you maintain those goals?
This is where the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of your goal really comes into play. Crawford says if you know your ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù then it‚Äôs easier to keep the big picture in mind.
‚ÄúFor example, your goal may be to walk more often. Why is walking your goal? Is that because you really value your vitality and your mobility, and you want to keep up with your children? Is it because you really value connection; so, the morning walk you have with your partner is really important to you? Is it because you want to improve your overall health so that you can go on a big hike or a trip that you have planned?‚Äù
Crawford says thinking about why you really value something and what the long-term picture is can really help you maintain progress on your goals.
¬†









Getting started can be half the battle. What‚Äôs your advice on finding motivation?









                    When we think about change, we might be waiting a long time If we're waiting to feel motivated to do something differently. It can be helpful to flip that around on its head and instead think about doing differently, to feel differently.

‚ÄúWhen we think about change, we might be waiting a long time If we're waiting to feel motivated to do something differently,‚Äù Crawford says. ‚ÄúIt can be helpful to flip that around on its head and instead think about doing differently, to feel differently.‚Äù
She says if you‚Äôre not feeling motivated to do something, it‚Äôs helpful to think about the tiniest step you can take towards that goal today.
‚ÄúJust something to give you a win,‚Äù Crawford says, ‚Äúand help you build on that to the next piece of the habit you're creating, or the goal or the change you're making. So, thinking about it less like you have to achieve all of it all at once and going a little bit at a time.‚Äù
Finally, she adds, it‚Äôs important to remember that everyone struggles with new goals; it‚Äôs never too late to re-set and try again.
‚ÄúInstead of feeling like a failure because you've set a New Year's resolution, go back to the basics,‚Äù Crawford says. ‚ÄúIs the goal reasonable? Do you need to break it down into smaller goals? Do you need to build some excitement and momentum by achieving some smaller goals in succession on the way to the larger goal?‚Äù

Introduction
Income and wealth inequality in the United States is substantially higher than in almost any other developed nation, and it is on the rise, sparking an intensifying national debate. The 2008 global financial crisis, the slow and uneven recovery, and the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have deepened these trends and challenged policymakers to respond.

Economists say the causes of worsening inequality are complex and include a failure to adapt to globalization and technological change, shifting tax policy, reduced bargaining power among workers, and long-standing racial and gender discrimination. The effects of inequality are similarly varied, and they have exacerbated crises such as the pandemic and deepened societal divisions. Inequality can also weaken democracy and give rise to authoritarian movements. President Joe Biden has pledged to reduce economic inequality with new social spending financed by higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, but he faces opposition from those who say his plans go too far.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office [PDF], income inequality in the United States has been rising for decades, with the incomes of the highest echelon of earners rapidly outpacing the rest of the population. Even among high earners, income gains have been heavily skewed toward the top of that bracket.¬†


The growth of CEO pay is illustrative of this trend. In 1965, a typical corporate CEO earned about twenty times that earned by a typical worker; by 2018, the ratio was 278:1, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. Between 1978 and 2018, CEO compensation increased by more than 900 percent while worker compensation increased by just 11.9 percent.¬†


The picture is much the same when looking at wealth‚Äîthat is, total net worth rather than yearly income. In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021.¬†

Moreover, inequality in the United States outpaces that of other rich nations. This is captured by the steady rise in the U.S. Gini coefficient, a measure of a country‚Äôs economic inequality that ranges from zero (completely equal) to one hundred (completely unequal). The United States‚Äô Gini coefficient was forty in 2019‚Äîthe same as Bulgaria‚Äôs and Turkey‚Äôs, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany‚Äîaccording to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies.¬†


Recent economic shocks have deepened these trends. The so-called Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 caused incomes to fall, and even when they recovered to pre-recession levels in 2015, the median income was the same as it was in 2000: $70,200. The recovery was also unequal: by 2016, the top 10 percent had more wealth than they did in 2007 while the bottom 90 percent had less.¬†

Experts say the economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the largest spike in unemployment in modern history, will similarly exacerbate inequality. Low-wage workers were far more likely to be laid off and less likely to be rehired, though massive government stimulus helped blunt the impact. Meanwhile, a boom in stock and home prices primarily benefited wealthy Americans, who own more of these assets. Though wages rose at the fastest pace in decades, so did prices, and this inflation effectively canceled out wage gains.¬†¬†
Why does inequality matter?
Inequality is a drag on economic growth and fosters political dysfunction, experts say. Concentrated income and wealth reduces the level of demand in the economy because rich households tend to spend less of their income than poorer ones. Reduced opportunities for low-income households can also hurt the economy. ‚ÄúWhen those at the bottom of the income distribution are at great risk of not living up to their potential, the economy pays a price not only with weaker demand today, but also with lower growth in the future,‚Äù economist Joseph Stiglitz writes [PDF].
Recent years have seen the election of populist leaders around the world, which some researchers have linked to insecurity caused by economic inequality. Wealthy people can exert outsize influence on the government by financing political campaigns, further entrenching their power. A 2020 United Nations report warned that rising inequality is eroding trust in democratic societies and fostering the spread of authoritarian and nativist movements.

However, some experts say that the harms from inequality are overstated. Analysts at the libertarian Cato Institute, for instance, argue that it makes more sense to focus on poverty because inequality does not matter so long as everyone is doing better. Also, entrepreneurship benefits society as a whole, even as it makes some individuals wealthy, they argue. The overall poverty rate in the United States fell sharply, by more than 10 percentage points, between 1959 and 1969, but it has since fluctuated around 12.5 percent.¬†
‚ÄúWe should want to live in a society with a reasonable degree of mobility rather than one where people are born into relative economic positions they can never leave,‚Äù conservative analyst Ramesh Ponnuru wrote in 2015. ‚ÄúBut so long as those conditions are met, the ratio of the incomes of the top 1 percent to the median worker should be fairly low on our list of concerns.‚Äù
What is the state of U.S. economic mobility?
Americans have long prided themselves on the ability to move up the income ladder, but there are signs that U.S. economic mobility is disappearing. The fraction of Americans who earn more than their parents has shrunk from more than 90 percent of those born in the 1940s to 50 percent of those born in the 1980s.
Harvard University economist Raj Chetty, who has studied social mobility extensively, found that mobility in the United States varies widely across the country [PDF]. Some wealthy cities have high mobility, on par with countries such as Denmark and Canada, while children in some lower-income areas have less than a 5 percent chance of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution when starting from the bottom fifth.
Overall economic mobility is lower in the United States than in many other developed countries, which some experts argue hampers U.S. economic growth. In a 2016 Stanford University study [PDF], the United States ranked behind several other wealthy countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and Japan.¬†
How do race, ethnicity, and gender factor in?
The relationship between race, ethnicity, and inequality has been well-documented. Since 1960, the median wealth of white households has tripled while the wealth of Black households has barely increased. For decades, the unemployment rate among Black Americans has been roughly twice that of white Americans. Black Americans are also underrepresented in high-paying professions, including corporate leadership. As of 2020, only four of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are Black. Black and American Indian children have far lower economic mobility compared to white, Asian, and children of Hispanic ethnicity, according to Chetty‚Äôs research.


U.S. inequality today is rooted in systemic racism and the legacy of slavery. Through a policy known as redlining that resulted from a New Deal program in the 1930s, Black Americans were systematically denied mortgages, leading to housing segregation and a disparity in home ownership, which is a major source of wealth. Though racial discrimination in housing was banned by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the effects persist. Black Americans were similarly excluded from the benefits of the G.I. Bill after World War II, which is widely credited with helping to grow the middle class.
Black Americans also face discrimination in the labor market, because hiring is often done internally via networks that exclude them, says William E. Spriggs, an economics professor at Howard University and the chief economist at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).
The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare many of these disparities. American Indian, Black, and Latinx Americans were more likely to be hospitalized with and die from COVID-19 than white Americans‚Äîan inequity that CFR‚Äôs Catherine Powell calls the ‚Äúcolor of COVID.‚Äù People of color were more likely to be laid off; and they were more likely to be considered essential workers, performing jobs that typically came with greater exposure to the virus, such as cashiering and package delivery.
The existence of a gender pay gap is also well-founded, though there is a debate over its causes. The pay gap has narrowed over the past forty years as women have obtained more education, but it has not shrunk as much since 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute‚Äôs Elise Gould. Gould attributes this in part to discrimination and the underrepresentation of women in high-paying jobs.
What role does education play?
Most high wages come from jobs that require a high level of education. In 2016, U.S. families headed by someone with a bachelor's degree earned double that of those headed by someone without, and families with a postgraduate degree holder earned nearly three times as much, according to a 2019 study [PDF] by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The share of the nation‚Äôs income earned by families with at least one bachelor‚Äôs degree increased from 45 percent to 63 percent between 1989 and 2016.
The difference is even starker for net worth. In 2016, families headed by a postgraduate degree holder had nearly eight times more wealth than families without a college degree. In 2015, nearly 25 percent of people without a high school diploma were living in poverty, compared to just 5 percent of those with a college degree, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The percentage of Americans with a bachelor‚Äôs degree has steadily increased since the end of World War II, reaching around 38 percent in 2021. The United States is above the OECD average in attainment of higher education but is behind several other wealthy countries, including Canada, Japan, and South Korea.¬†

However, college degrees do not guarantee good jobs. Though the college wage premium (the percentage by which the wages of college graduates exceed those of high school graduates) grew rapidly from 1979 to 2000, it has since fallen off, and there is significant income inequality even among college graduates. The Federal Reserve study found that the college wealth premium (the increase in net worth from having a degree) has declined significantly for white Americans born in the 1980s and has disappeared entirely for Black Americans born that decade. According to the study, these diminishing returns could be due to the surging cost of college‚Äîwhich has risen by almost triple the rate of consumer price increases since 1978.
What about tax rates?
The top U.S. income tax rates have been repeatedly cut over the past half century, which some experts say has contributed to growing inequality. When President John F. Kennedy entered the White House in 1961, the top tax rate was more than 90 percent. Today, the top rate stands at 37 percent. The top 1 percent‚Äôs share of income dramatically increased after President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes in the early 1980s.

Likewise, the corporate income tax has declined steadily as a share of corporate profits and as a percentage of gross domestic product over the past half century. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 dramatically lowered the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.
The capital gains tax, a tax on the sale of assets including stocks, land, and art, has also declined over time, though the rate was increased in 2013 to 20 percent. The wealthy generally benefit more from capital gains than from regular employment income, leading some experts to argue that the gap between the capital gains tax and the income tax contributes to inequality.
What are some other drivers of growing inequality?¬†
Long-term economic forces play a role, both by boosting rewards to high earners and undermining wages for low- and medium-skill jobs. Those forces, experts say, include waning worker power, increased monopolization of the economy, and globalization. Some Americans have greatly benefited from a globalized world, whereby they can reach more consumers and manufacture products at lower costs. But globalization has also introduced tough competition for American workers, as some jobs were moved overseas and wages stagnated.¬†
The decline of unions is another contributing factor: the average union member earns roughly 25 percent more than their non-union counterpart. In 1983, about 20 percent of all workers were represented by unions. By 2019, that number had dropped to just 6.2 percent. This has disproportionately affected Black workers, who historically have been more likely to unionize. However, union power is on the rise, as the rapid economic recovery from the pandemic has created a tight labor market in which workers have greater leverage.
Then there is trade policy, a perennial controversy that was supercharged by President Donald Trump‚Äôs election in 2016. Trump has long been critical of U.S. trade deals, claiming that other countries, particularly China, have taken advantage of the United States to the detriment of U.S. workers. Many economists have disputed the role of trade in manufacturing job losses, arguing that such losses were offset by gains in other sectors [PDF] and that wages have increased as a result of trade.
Still others say that technological change, including automation, is primarily responsible for job losses, not trade. In Foreign Affairs, former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer writes that even though trade is not the sole reason jobs have disappeared, ‚Äúit cannot be denied that the outsourcing of jobs from high- to low-wage places has devastated communities in the American Rust Belt and elsewhere.‚Äù
What are some policy proposals to address inequality?
Proposals put forward in recent years to address income and wealth inequality have included supporting unionization and raising the minimum wage; making the tax code more progressive, as well as taxing wealth alongside income; and increasing access to education, including early education and college.
One tool for addressing income inequality that has received significant attention is a more progressive tax code, meaning that higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate than lower ones. Some experts and politicians argue that shifting more money from the rich to the poor would reduce inequality and benefit society overall. But others say that higher taxes would stifle economic growth and innovation. Democrats generally subscribe to the former view and Republicans to the latter, though some Democratic presidents have cut taxes and some Republican presidents have raised them. The parties‚Äô positions on taxes have calcified in recent years.
Proposed taxes on wealth, rather than income, have become increasingly popular among Democrats and were championed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 presidential primary. In March 2022, for the first time as president, Biden called for a wealth tax, proposing a ‚Äúbillionaire minimum income tax‚Äù in his annual budget request. Households worth more than $100 million would have to pay a tax of at least 20 percent of their income, including on so-called unrealized gains from assets such as stocks that have increased in value but have not been sold. Critics challenge the merits of such redistribution, arguing that such a tax would be bad for the economy, difficult to implement, and even unconstitutional.¬†
Biden has also proposed increasing the tax on inherited wealth, which is known as the estate tax or, to critics, as the death tax. While proponents say such a tax would dramatically reduce inequality, others argue that it could lead to more tax evasion and discourage investment and entrepreneurship. Biden has also called for raising the corporate tax rate, the top income tax rate, and the capital gains tax.
To address the rising cost of college and increase access to higher education, some policymakers, including Sanders and Warren, have proposed tuition-free public college and the elimination of student loan debt. Some Republicans, including Trump, meanwhile, have pushed to allocate more federal money toward teaching skills and trades as an alternative.
To help close the Black employment gap, Howard University‚Äôs Spriggs suggests making all job postings publicly available, using computer algorithms to better match job seekers with job openings, and encouraging companies‚Äîparticularly Silicon Valley firms‚Äîto recruit more Black students. Spriggs also argues for stronger monitoring and enforcement of antidiscrimination laws.
Some experts, including CFR‚Äôs Edward Alden, say the pandemic should compel Washington to retool the U.S. economy. A stronger social safety net, including better unemployment benefits, robust sick leave policies, and more job retraining programs, could help workers manage shocks and make the economy more resilient. ‚ÄúWhat the country needs is not a series of short-term bailouts, but long-term plans to ensure that most Americans are protected against such crises in the future,‚Äù writes Alden.

Higher Education Webinar: Navigating Digital Equity

 
Play













Mordecai Ian Brownlee, president of the Community College of Aurora, will lead the conversation on navigating the digital equity gap in higher education. 

¬†

FASKIANOS: Welcome to CFR‚Äôs Higher Education Webinar. I‚Äôm Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach at CFR. 

Today‚Äôs discussion is on the record, and the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/academic. CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.

We are delighted to have Mordecai Ian Brownlee with us today to talk about the digital equity gap in higher education. Dr. Brownlee is president of the Community College of Aurora in Colorado. He also teaches for Lamar University in the College of Education and Human Development. Dr. Brownlee publishes frequently and serves as a columnist for EdSurge. He has been featured on a number of national platforms including by Diverse Issues in Higher Education magazine as a new school leader representing the next generation of college presidents, and he was most recently appointed to serve on the board of directors of the American Association of Community Colleges. 

So, Dr. Brownlee, thank you very much for taking the time to be with us. I thought we could begin by having you define digital equity and give us an overview of the digital equity gap in higher education, and I know you are going to share a presentation with us so we look forward to seeing that on screen. 

BROWNLEE: Absolutely. Thank you so much for the opportunity to the Council on Foreign Relations. Just thank you all so much. 

And to answer that question as we talk about digital equity, it‚Äôs the assurance of ensuring that all have access to the information technology available and to have the capacity to engage in society and productive citizenship. And so we‚Äôll talk about that and let me just start sharing the screen and we‚Äôll jump right into it. 

All right. Here we go. 

So, once again, thank you all for the opportunity, again, to the Council of Foreign Relations for this opportunity to talk about navigating digital equity. Bringing greetings on behalf of the Community College of Aurora here in Aurora, Colorado. And let‚Äôs just jump right into it. 

You know, as we talk about defining this work, how to navigate this work, we have to first understand the work, and to understand digital equity we must first understand the digital divide. 

And so, you know, as we talked about the digital divide at the beginning of the pandemic it, certainly, was dealing with the voice and mindset, the texture and tone, of accessibility and being able to engage in learning throughout the pandemic and, first of all, I would say as educators it‚Äôs so critical that even as we are, quote/unquote, ‚Äúcoming out of the pandemic‚Äù that we still acknowledge part of the challenges that are happening across the country and across the world in regards to accessibility‚Äîequitable accessibility to information technology, to the tools, and to have the capacity to not only learn but, certainly, engage in the economy and society. 

So as we talk about digital equity, we must understand the digital divide and so let‚Äôs kind of define that. One of my favorite definitions for the digital divide defined comes from the National League of Cities and they say the digital divide is the gap between individuals who have access to computers, high-speed internet, and the skills to use them, and those who do not. 

There‚Äôs two critical components as we talk about digital equity that I want to call out with the digital divide definition here. One is access. The other is skill. Access and skill. So as we think about equity and just think about how do we level the playing field, how do we close the gap on accessibility and skill attainment to engage. 

And it‚Äôs not just being able to access and that‚Äôs the other‚ÄîI think the complexity here as we think about the term equity because just because I provide you the computer, right‚Äîand we found this during the pandemic‚Äîjust because I provide you the computer do you even have broadband access? And if you have broadband access do you have dependable sustainable broadband access? 

And then if you have sustainable broadband access, are you skilled to not only learn but and engage through this instrument and tool, and that in itself is where we have found there to be challenges as we think throughout the pandemic and, certainly, beyond the pandemic on what we must do to close the gap for equity and the digital divide. So digital divide provides that access, skill. Equity will then take us deeper into this work.

Here are key factors I want to call out in regards to how we must eradicate or address these challenges, these factors, in order to close the gap on the digital divide. 

Number one, what we have seen through research‚Äîand digitalresponsibility.org has done a great job of calling this out‚Äînumber one, age-related issues as we think about the various generations that are engaged in society and still present in society.

We have digital natives. I consider myself to be a digital native as a millennial. But this is very different than previous generations that may not have had the proper training and skill and their jobs do not have them engaging, utilizing these tools and instruments on a regular basis and so that in itself has created some challenges. 

And, again, there is, certainly, all those that are outliers and those among the generations that have been able to engage in these instruments and tools. However, it is truly a fact through research that age-related issues have been a part of this challenge, more specifically, speaking to our older population.

Socioeconomic factors‚Äîhave to talk about it. I think about it, especially in the higher education space. Our tribal institutions is where I‚Äôve heard throughout the pandemic some of our most severe challenges that have been experienced in regards to the digital divide. 

One of the stories that I heard that just breaks my heart‚ÄîI remember the first time I heard it, it truly had me in tears‚Äîwe were at the height of the pandemic at this point and what we were learning is in one particular tribal community in order for those students to complete‚Äîthese are young K-12 students‚Äîin order for them to complete their assignments they had elders and community members of that tribe that would walk the students up to the highest point on the mountain within that particular tribal territory just to be able to pick up an internet signal, and they were able to do this when there was not as much traffic on that internet broadband access‚Äîthat grid, if you will. 

And so those students were having to do their work‚Äîtheir homework‚Äîbetween the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. in the morning. Very interesting reality‚Äîunfortunate reality. We, certainly, have to come up with the solutions to addressing this. This in itself is part of that digital divide conversation.

Geographic causes‚Äîit depends on where you are in the country. I remember at one point in time I was teaching and served the University of Charleston out of Charleston, West Virginia, and for those that are familiar with that part of the country in the Appalachia, I would have my students that were having to use their own cell phones in order to complete their assignments and upload their assignments. 

They did not have either, in some cases, the actual tools or accessibility, would have to drive in to more populated spaces to pick up a signal. This was impacting their learning experience. This in itself is all a part of that digital divide. 

Last, certainly, not least, racial, culture, language. All of this plays a role and more in that skill set component along with accessibility component and how are we going to as educators, as key stakeholders within our community, leaders, be a part of the solution to close that divide.

Age-related issues, socioeconomic factors, geographic causes, racial, cultural, and language. Again, digitalresponsibility.org is the source on that there. 

Step two, to navigate digital equity we must understand digital equity, and so now we‚Äôre going to go and delve into what does it mean‚Äîwhat does digital equity mean. So I‚Äôm taking my definition, again, from the National League of Cities. 

Digital equity is a condition in which all individuals and communities have the information technology capacity needed for full participation in our society, democracy, and economy. This is huge. 

So, again, as you heard me talk about the digital divide just moments ago, it‚Äôs the component of accessibility and skill. That skill is then where we get into productive citizenship through society, democracy, and economy, and so now we‚Äôre talking about how does this tool, this instrument‚Äîit‚Äôs much more than just accessibility. Now how do I engage? How am I advancing my family, my economic‚Äîsocial economic realities through this instrument and tool? 

The definition goes on to say‚Äîagain, by the National League of Cities‚Äîdigital equity is necessary for civic and cultural participation, employment, lifelong learning, and access to essential services. 

Case in point, life. As we think about all aspects of life from employment to social participation‚Äîas we think social media engagement, employment, we all understand what that means; lifelong learning, certainly as educators we have to think about that component‚Äîand then accessibility to the tools that we need, I think about my own child who this past weekend had to reach out for virtual assistance from medical care for an earache that he was having. My ability to have the skill set and accessibility to reach out, obtain those resources for my family, and engage through an electronic means to fulfill what my needs were are all a part of this equity. Life in itself should be able to remain whole in what I produce and how it is able to produce within me, and that is in itself digital equity. 

So step three, let‚Äôs discuss how to navigate digital equity in higher education and, again, hello to all of our educators that are on the call today. So here‚Äôs some tips that I want to leave for you on today just to think about, and I look forward to our conversation that we‚Äôre about to have here in a moment.

Number one, as educators‚Äîand we‚Äôre talking about navigating digital equity‚Äîit is so important that we understand who we‚Äôre serving. I say that because, unfortunately, what can happen is especially as educators and we think about the economy, the disruptions that we‚Äôre experiencing in the marketplace right now, we‚Äôll sometimes pursue who we want, not necessarily who we have, and that‚Äôs unfortunate. 

As we think about the respective institutional missions and the spaces in which we serve, we have to be mission centered and embrace who it is that we‚Äôre serving because we owe it to those students who are pursuing their academic endeavors and their professional endeavors through our respective institutions to totally be served. We must understand their realities.

One of the conversations we have here at the Community College of Aurora is the conversation about you don‚Äôt know who is actually sitting, respectively, in that seat in that classroom and what they had to overcome in order to sit in that seat that particular day. 

Do we know how many bus routes they had to take? Do we understand the challenges that they were having with their children? Do we know are they now leaving their second job that they‚Äôve worked for the past twenty-four hours to now sit in your classroom?

So we have to understand, be aware, and approach that engagement with a sense of grace. I think that‚Äôs a word that we, perhaps, haven‚Äôt necessarily embraced in the academy in the way in which we have‚Äîshould have, but now more than ever we have to.

Secondly, create systems that level the learning engagement field. So it‚Äôs this idea of privilege‚Äîthis thought of privilege‚Äîand, perhaps, what we assumed that everyone had access to and what everyone had the ability to engage with that they don‚Äôt necessarily have, and if they do have accessibility to it do we have a true understanding of what all they have to do to have that level of engagement and accessibility? 

Again, case in point, bus routes. Think about what‚Äôs happening around our country. There has been a reduction from a transportation standpoint financially, and many of the routes and the transportation services that have been provided‚Äîsome of this due to disruption, others due to areas in which there have had to be a funneling of tax dollars and resources in other spaces and places in our communities. 

Long story short, the reality is, is that in many communities the bus routes have had to be reduced, which means that individuals are either having to walk or find ways to public accessibility to some of these resources in terms of broadband access and computer access. 

So then as we‚Äôre teaching and we‚Äôre instructing and we‚Äôre providing services, we have to think about how can we level the playing field and remove barriers? Does it have to be performed‚Äîdoes that learning outcome have to come in the form of computer access and broadband accessibility? 

And maybe it does, so this takes us to point number three. Let‚Äôs promote community resources to close the digital divide. I think that laser focus on how we‚Äôre going to close that divide creates this space for equity, and so, perhaps, it‚Äôs through libraries. 

There‚Äôs one organization out of North Carolina in some of their rural spaces they have now through grant funds created different spaces in their rural communities for those in more rural spaces to gain access to a computer lab and the grants are sustaining that accessibility through computer labs in those rural spaces. Amazing resource.

There‚Äôs many others and examples that we can share around the country. So with that said, let‚Äôs promote these community resources. Sometimes it‚Äôs a library. Sometimes it‚Äôs a grant-funded opportunity. Sometimes it‚Äôs a local nonprofit. So let‚Äôs talk about how we can be creative in our respective communities to close the gap there. 

Fourth, adjust learning experiences to be more inclusive. Not only do we need to create the systems to level the playing field but we must then adjust the learning experiences to be more inclusive to create learning spaces and engagement spaces for all, going back to not only accessibility but skill. 

Last, certainly not least, providing institutional resources to close the digital divide. What I mean by this is, is that, in closing, due to‚Äîthrough the pandemic and many of our institutions received the Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds‚Äîthe HEERF funds. Those HEERF funds were utilized in many different ways. In many cases, we were able to do laptop loan programs. In some spaces they were even doing hotspot loan programs. 

And so now that we are coming out of the pandemic what does it look like to sustain these resources, OK, because now that we provide these resources how do we sustain them? How do we ensure that we‚Äôre having long-term engagements? 

One of the things that I want and I ask from my educators, especially administrators, to look at: How do we close this‚Äî(inaudible)‚Äîwithout placing the costs on the backs of our students? They already have enough going on. We don‚Äôt need to just move the cost of something on to their tuition and fees. 

How can we be even more creative with the engagements and enrollments of our students to being laser focused on what we‚Äôre doing to close, again, many of those factors and gaps that were highlighted earlier? 

So grateful for the opportunity. Have a website. Would love to engage with you all more. I know we‚Äôre getting ready to go into conversation. But itsdrmordecai.com and, again, thank you all so much for the opportunity. 

FASKIANOS: Fantastic. Thank you so much for that overview. 

So we‚Äôre going to go to all of you for your questions now. You can click the raised hand icon on your screen to ask a question, and on an iPad or a tablet click the more button to access the raised hand feature. 

When you‚Äôre called upon accept the unmute prompt and please state your name and affiliation followed by a question. You can also submit a written question by the Q&A icon and I will read out the question, and if you do write your question please include your affiliation just to give us a sense of where you‚Äôre coming from. 

And there are no questions as of yet but I know that will change, or else you were so thorough that nobody has questions. (Laughs.)

So do you see now with the pandemic experience that there will be continued‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to ask the first question‚Äîyou know, that this has opened up the space now for deeper understanding of the digital divide and bringing the resources to bear? 

Or now that we‚Äôre kind of post-pandemic or whatever this is people have forgotten about it and are moving on?

BROWNLEE: Thank you so much for the question, my friend.

I think that it‚Äôs twofold. There‚Äôs two sides of this coin, right. So there‚Äôs the one side of the coin where the awareness now is so much deeper and richer than it ever has been because of the amount of resources and what it took to sustain since 2020 those resources that were being provided to the students in the community. 

So now there‚Äôs many that have learned and they‚Äôre now having those conversations about how to sustain the resources because, as we all know, while there‚Äôs been an extension of HEERF funds through the Department of Education, that day is coming to an end here pretty soon and so we have to talk about sustainability. 

The other side of that coin is, unfortunately, there are those that acknowledge what the realities were but their agenda is more on how do we move past it, not necessarily sustain what we were providing. 

That‚Äôs part of the issue for some that we have to address because we don‚Äôt just move on from hardship, right. That hardship is real and we have to still maintain a laser focus on how we‚Äôre going to close the digital divide, especially in the academic spaces, but also understanding our responsibility as not only educators but community leaders, stakeholders within our community, to be a part of the solutions and the expansions on equitable access and resources being made available. 

And so I think with both sides of those coins we‚Äôre seeing two different realities. But I think that there‚Äôs also a need now more than ever to maintain the senses of urgency around the haves and have nots and what we‚Äôre going to do to be a part of the solution to ensure that we‚Äôre raising the level of accessibility and skill for all within our communities. 

FASKIANOS: I noted in your presentation you talked about knowing who your students are. So what advice do you have for higher education educators and leaders who are trying to navigate the digital divide in their classroom and to get to know‚Äîto figure out where their students are coming from and what their needs may be?

BROWNLEE: So, as we all know, especially in the IR space, right, there‚Äôs different tools, resources, that we can use to survey our students. 

There‚Äôs different splash pages, if you will, that we can utilize in terms of the enrollment processes or the readvising processes, or even think of some of our learning management tools that we can engage with students to determine what their needs truly are. 

I think that it‚Äôs important that we create tools and instruments that will have high engagement rates. Sometimes those have to be incentivized. But we have to think about outside of our normal student leader responses how we‚Äôre capturing the voice of all of our students. 

And so that‚Äôs those that would not typically provide response, and as we think about the digital divide we have to acknowledge that that tool, that instrument, can‚Äôt just be electronic. What are we going to do to have paper resources or maybe through phone conversations, outreach, being able to have, certainly, the walk around conversations around our respective campuses and the universities. 

And so we need to have those conversations to make sure that we‚Äôre capturing the voice of all of our students, I think, is in the true spirit of continued improvement. We have to understand who we serve and then acknowledge, through the development of systems and the recalibration of our student experiences, are the voice of these students. 

FASKIANOS: Right. And in terms of the skills, because community colleges are so focused on developing the skills, what specifically are you doing at Aurora or are you seeing in the community college space to help students develop those skills that they need to navigate digitally?

BROWNLEE: Absolutely. One of the things I‚Äôll talk about‚Äîand those that may not be aware and I don‚Äôt know who all has visited Denver‚Äîbut the history of Aurora‚ÄîAurora is the most diverse community‚Äîcity‚Äîin the state of Colorado. 

I call that out because immigrants‚Äîit has a strong‚Äîthere‚Äôs a strong population in this community and so part of our young thirty-nine years of existence in this community has been providing English second language courses. 

We‚Äôre noticing that especially our immigrant families and communities that are seeking social and economic mobility, highly skilled from where they come from but now we must create learning opportunities to close that gap, not only through language but through accessibility in this American market. 

And so through our community ESL programs we‚Äôve been able to educate upwards of two thousand students a year and walk them through the various levels of learning and engagement with the English language, and then at some point in that process‚Äîlearning process‚Äîwe then engage and begin the computer engagement in utilizing the English language in their native language and beginning to close that gap. 

So I think that that work in itself is a part of that digital equity that must be created‚Äîhow do you create the foundation to build upon to then advance the engagement. And there‚Äôs been some other great examples that I‚Äôve seen around the country in doing that work, a lot of grant programs that I‚Äôve seen in respective communities. 

You heard me talk about what‚Äôs happening out there in the Carolinas. But I think about what‚Äôs also happening over in California. California has been a great state that‚Äôs been able to do some work about working and identifying through heat maps and institutional resource‚Äîresearch and resources and community resources, looking at demographics, identifying low socioeconomic spaces, and putting concentrated efforts in those particular communities to increase the level of engagement, accessibility, and skill, and it‚Äôs critical and key. 

FASKIANOS: Great. We have a question from Gloria Ayee. So if you can unmute yourself and state your affiliation. 

Q: Hello. Thank you so much for sharing this important work that you‚Äôre doing. 

I am Gloria Ayee and I am a lecturer and senior research fellow at Harvard University, and my question is about the connection between the digital divide and also how it mirrors to current inequities that we see in the educational system in general. 

So thinking about that type of relationship, what do you think are the most significant challenges to addressing the digital divide, given the issues that we continue to see with the educational system in general at all types of institutions, and what do you foresee as the best way to actually address these challenges?

BROWNLEE: Oh, that‚Äôs a great question. Great question. Thank you so much for asking that question, Gloria.

I would say two things come to mind‚Äîfunding and agenda, right. So if‚ÄîI‚Äôll tell you what comes to mind for me. So as we think about financially and we look at how these institutions are funded around the country, let‚Äôs think K-12. So grade schools. Think K-12. Let‚Äôs also think higher education. 

Are we talking headcount? Are we talking full-time equivalency? Are we talking success points? Are we talking‚Äîeven as we think about developmental education, how are these institutions being funded to sustain the work of working especially with low socioeconomic communities? 

Let‚Äôs just take, for example, full-time equivalency, especially in this higher education space. So if I were someone who wanted to work to create programs that I‚Äôm going to help in the advancing and addressing of the digital divide and advancing digital equity, I need funds in order to do that. 

Now, could I pursue grant funds? Absolutely. But even‚Äîwe all know that grant funds are not necessarily all the time sustainable funds. Short-term funds, but it still has to be a hard-lined. So then as we think about doing this work‚ÄîI‚Äôll go back to funding and agenda‚Äîrealizing and looking at what would need to shift within particularly my state‚Äôs legislative agenda or, perhaps, in that particular district how the funding is occurring. 

If I‚Äôm working with a high population, which we are here at the Community College of Aurora‚Äîa high population of part-time students, these are students that are maybe taking one class and engaging. 

However, if I‚Äôm funded by a full-time equivalency model it then takes several students that are taking one class to then equal that one full-time equivalent, which then impacts my funding structure. So then how do I then serve, yet, I am seeking to obtain? And this is where we then get into, I think, a part of that friction of agenda and funding models. 

So I think that as we think equity‚Äîwith an equity mindset beyond just the initiatives of overlay‚Äîwe actually want to bake in the equity experience within our respective states and communities‚Äîthen we‚Äôre going to have to take a look at the funding agenda, the agenda and funding‚Äîhow are we truly going to advance equity and closing the digital divide. It has to be funded properly towards sustainability. 

We‚Äôve seen this same thing occur in developmental education as well for those who‚Äôve been a part of those conversations where we saw around the country there will be a reduction in developmental education funding, which has been impacted, in some cases, the success rates and resources that were historically provided through community colleges in certain communities. 

Same thing in this digital divide space and digital equity. So funding an agenda, and I think that the solution is, is really coming to the table and saying what does equity look like without it being an overlaid agenda, without it just being a conversation? 

What does it look like for it to be baked into the experience of how we‚Äôre going to transform lives, which then means that, in many cases, legislatively and funding models. We have to move from a transactional mindset to a transformational mindset and we have to go all in on ensuring that we‚Äôre creating equitable communities and engagements for those that we serve. 

Oh, you‚Äôre muted, my friend. 

FASKIANOS: Yes. Thank you. After two-and-a-half years‚Äî(laughter)‚ÄîI should know that. 

Encourage all of you to share your best practices and what you‚Äôre doing in your communities as well. 

You know, we have seen the Biden administration really focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion. They‚Äôre focusing on bringing more diversity to the State Department and other parts of the government. Is the Department of Education looking at the funding model? Is this an area that they are actively trying to reform and adjust? 

BROWNLEE: I get the sense‚Äîand I‚Äôve had the pleasure of speaking in front of several legislators in different venues‚ÄîI get the sense that there is a major conversation that‚Äôs happening. I do. I truly get the sense that there‚Äôs a major conversation happening, not just with our current administration from thinking about our U.S. president but also thinking local legislators as well.

I really think that there‚Äôs conversations‚Äîmany conversations that are happening. If anything, I feel as though the major‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to use the word barrier so I‚Äôm searching for the appropriate word here. But I think the major hurdle that we‚Äôre going to have to think about is how we have built and designed our funding models to date. 

You know, some of these funding models were built in early 1990s, mid-1990s in some cases. Really, you don‚Äôt see it too much early 2000s, and so we have older financial modeling infrastructure that we‚Äôre trying to pursue this work and how to change it. 

And so it can‚Äôt be a Band-Aid approach. I think in some spaces and communities that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been done is that rather than changing the actual model, the infrastructure itself, it‚Äôs received a Band-Aid in the form of grants. 

And I do believe that grants are significant and, certainly, necessary and appreciated. However, I think that we‚Äôre reaching a point in society where there has to be a total restructuring of our funding models and taking a look at what percentages are going where, taking a look at the demographics in our respective communities, taking a look at the economic realities in our respective communities. 

Take a look at just how much the demographics are shifting in our respective communities and building a model that‚Äôs ready to engage, sustain, and raise the level for all, and I think that we‚Äôre on our way. I, certainly, hope that we are. 

FASKIANOS: Thank you. 

I‚Äôm going to take the next question from Rufus Glasper. 

Q: I am here.

FASKIANOS: Wonderful.

Q: Hi, Mordecai. How are you today? 

BROWNLEE: How are you, sir?

Q: Hi, Irina.

FASKIANOS: Hi, Rufus. Great to hear from you. 

Q: Mordecai, talk a little bit about digital equity and faculty. How have they accepted, rejected, embraced what you were describing as all of the different factors that are affecting our students, and what kind of practices have you developed or can be developed to ensure that faculty can continue the progress and include our students who are most needy? 

BROWNLEE: Great question, Dr. Glasper. I didn‚Äôt expect anything different coming from you. 

So, let me just say, we‚Äôve had some very intense conversations, and I have to really give our faculty and our instructors kudos because I will tell you this is probably by far one of the most engaged communities that I‚Äôve ever worked in of educators that are committed to just truly getting to the solution. 

There‚Äôs some strong work that was done around inclusive excellence here at the Community College of Aurora, certainly, prior to my arrival. It led to this college receiving an Inclusive Excellence Award from the American Association of Community Colleges right around 2017.

Part of their work at that time was looking at, as our faculty and our academy, how were we going to close the gap on success rates, particularly in English and math, and part of that work was creating resources towards gap closure to ensure that those that had not traditionally and historically had access to some of those learning materials and plans and resources that they were being provided those in a more intensive way. 

Now as we think more into the digital space and, certainly, think through the pandemic, what we‚Äôve now done as an institution is that we‚Äôve become‚ÄîCommunity College of Aurora has become the very first Achieving the Dream institution in the state of Colorado and one of the projects that our faculty and our instructors are delving into‚ÄîI‚Äôve got a big meeting tomorrow on this, matter of fact‚Äîis taking a look at the respective success rates in our gateway courses‚Äîour key courses that are gateways into our respective academic programs‚Äîand asking ourselves how can we create more equitable learning experiences.

Two things‚Äîcritical things‚Äîthat I‚Äôve seen our faculty do.

Number one, looking at the data. I think that the data is key and critical‚Äîtaking a look, disaggregating that data. And our faculty and our instructors continue to do that work, looking at a three-year spread, a five-year spread, and saying: Where is the success occurring? Who‚Äôs it occurring with and those respective identities of those students? And then really asking the hard questions: Why isn‚Äôt this population succeeding at the same rate as this population?

The other part of this criticality is, is also then accepting that there can‚Äôt be an excuse in the work. There can‚Äôt be an excuse in the work and that we must ensure then that we are creating the equitable resources and infrastructure to close the gap, create learning experiences, and say, listen, if our students can‚Äôt access the internet and the Web then what can we do to create for them the resources, whether it be paper? 

If they can‚Äôt come to the teaching demonstration at this particular day how can I create an opportunity for them to engage and obtain that information at another given time? Perhaps they‚Äôre a working parent and can‚Äôt necessarily attend at 10:00 a.m. but they can at 5:00 p.m. What are we doing to level the playing field with accessibility? 

And the other aspect of that is just that our faculty and instructors have been partnering to create these more holistic learning engagement opportunities where if we‚Äôre having a conversation in English then what can we do within our math department and almost cohorting, in a sense, the learning experiences amongst those two separate classes but then creating like engagements where the same conversations happening in English could be happening in math and science to begin to bring about a new learning within the students to say, OK, well, this particular world issue, now I‚Äôm understanding it through various lenses and I understand the interconnectivity in these learning experiences.

And so more integrated learning, and I think that we‚Äôve got a long way to go but we‚Äôre committed to doing that work. 

FASKIANOS: So Rufus Glasper is the chancellor of Maricopa Community Colleges, and I just thought I would ask you, Rufus, to maybe share your experience as the chancellor what has been working in your community. 

Q: I am the chancellor emeritus. I have not been at the colleges for a little over six years now. But I am the president and CEO for the League for Innovation in the Community College.

And one of the things that I‚Äôd like to connect with with our experience right now we are involved in the state of Arizona with a project which is‚Äîwhich we are embracing. We are working with four different types of institutions right now‚Äîurban metropolitan, we have a couple of rural institutions and we have a couple of tribal, and we‚Äôre trying to make that connectiveness between insecurities‚Äîstudent insecurities. 

So we‚Äôre looking at housing. We‚Äôre looking at hunger. We‚Äôre looking at jobs. And one of the things that we have found is that we can‚Äôt make either of these items connect and work without broadband first, and the reason being when you‚Äôre looking at access it‚Äôs critical when you start to look at the activities that are occurring throughout the U.S. now and specifically within Arizona‚ÄîI‚Äôll talk about the connections we have now made that are national in scope, that are city, town, and county in scope, and the commitments that we are now working to obtain from all of those who are in position relative to enhancing broadband access and digital equity. 

There‚Äôs actually a Center for Digital Equity at Arizona State University (ASU), and last week we had a gathering of all of our institutions to get a better understanding of what does digital equity mean as it comes from the ASU center. What does it mean for each of our different types of institutions, and I will tell you that the one that was hardest hit was the one you talked about and that‚Äôs tribal just in terms of access, in terms of resources. 

But I am pleased with the dollars that are out there now at all levels. So if this is a time for us to increase access, increase affordability, than I think we should seize the moment. 

My question then, which would lead to another one, is on the whole notion of sustainability and you talked about that in terms of stimulus kinds of resources, and equity is in everyone‚Äôs face right now, especially broadband and others. 

Is it a sustainable initiative and focus and what are the elements that need to be connected in order to make sure that it stays in the forefront and that our students who may have benefited from buses sitting in their neighborhood during the pandemic and others but are still trying to make choices? 

And I‚Äôll make the last connection point, and you made the opening‚Äîhow flexible should our institutions be around work-based learning so that our students who are not able to come to the campus and be there on a regular basis but want to balance having a virtual environment? Do you see a balance coming or do you see us forced into staying the old, antiquated model of face-to-face classes and sixteen and eighteen weeks? 

BROWNLEE: Let me start with the sustainability component then. Thank you again, Dr. Glasper. 

From a sustainability standpoint, I‚Äôll say here at the institution part of the conversation‚Äîit‚Äôs a hard conversation. But I encourage every educator to have this conversation, this brave conversation, in your spaces. Let‚Äôs take a look at your success rates, and I‚Äôm just particularly speaking to higher education right now. 

Let‚Äôs take a look at your various academic profiles. Let‚Äôs take a look at what has been your engagements with your workforce partners, your advisory councils, in many cases, and let‚Äôs talk about two things‚Äîone, the sustainability of those programs and, two, the social and economic mobility of those programs directly to workforce.

I think what we will find is what we found here at the Community College of Aurora is that over time the various disruptions that have occurred has shifted the needs of our students. However, the institutions respectively delivering these services have not shifted with the times. 

And so it is quite possible that either our approach to the work or the actual lack of proper programming is prohibiting social and economic mobility in many of these communities and especially for us. Fifty-two percent of our students are first generation. Sixty-seven percent of our students are students of color. 

So as we talk about sustainability, we‚Äôre right there on the front line of having to take a look at enrollment, full-time equivalency, completion, graduation, and employment rates, and we began to find a shifting of that. And so when we talk sustainability, I bring this up as a framework, if you will, to say once you‚Äôve had those conversations now let‚Äôs talk about where there are losses‚Äîfinancial losses‚Äîand areas in which we can truly be innovative and reallocate dollars that were once going in certain areas and infuse that into other areas that are going to have a higher return. 

So I think thinking, truly, with a return on investment‚Äîan ROI mindset‚Äîwill then help us to not only meet the needs of our mission, meet it in its current state and its current needs and the disruption that‚Äôs currently being experienced, which will then help create new opportunities for sustainability beyond what has just been HEERF funding or potential grant funding, it can be hardlined into the institutional mission. 

I think the other component of that sustainability, too, is looking at the strategic plans of our respective organizations, looking at those‚Äînot only the mission but the objectives and asking how equity is not necessarily a separate objective but equity is actually ingrained in all aspects of the objectives‚Äîthe strategic objectives‚Äîbecause, at that point, we can then understand the significance in resourcing and funding equity all the way through the entirety of the institution. 

In regards to your latter question about work-based learning and the old model of doing things, I, certainly, believe and hope, Dr. Glasper, that there‚Äôs this new movement that‚Äôs occurring where we‚Äôre going to have to embrace, whether we like it or not, the next era of higher education, and that next era will require us to not approach things in the same modalities and same ways.

We‚Äôre watching, especially in research, the confidence levels reduce‚Äîheavily reduced now in the public‚Äôs perception of what higher education is to provide in comparison to what it once provided. Higher education in many communities isn‚Äôt necessarily being seen as the sole or the primary tool towards social economic mobility as it once was twenty, thirty years ago. 

So what does this mean? Our approach to sixteen-week instruction is, certainly, going to have to be transformed. What does it look like to have five-week instruction? Eight-week instruction? What does it look like for us to have true noncredit instructional programs that‚Äôs in direct partnership with business and industry to ramp up the training and social economic mobility opportunities within our communities? 

Folks aren‚Äôt necessarily looking for a two-year or a four-year or a six-year learning experience. They need to put food on their family‚Äôs table today. What does it look like for them to engage with the institution and have that kind of learning experience, and we have to do it with a digital equity mindset, right, because they‚Äôre seeking opportunity. So it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that they have accessibility in their current state. 

We want to get them to a state where they can have that accessibility. So how then do we create those tools? 

One key component of this is even looking at our college application processes. What is the readability score on some of these applications? We want to educate those that may have a reading level of a‚Äîseventh or eighth grade reading level. 

But some of these college applications are reading at a fourteen, fifteen grade reading level. That in itself is creating a barrier to those that are seeking opportunity, that need the opportunity to up skill. 

And so I think that the old model is going to, in my opinion, and hopefully quickly deteriorate and we‚Äôre going to have to be more effective. 

But let me also say this. It is critical that we have our faculty and our instructors at the table. These decisions shouldn‚Äôt be thrown upon them. It should be conversations that we‚Äôre having collectively together, and then how can then we resource our faculty and our instructors and our staff to be a part of those solutions, drive those solutions, reinvest in them to be able to create more innovative and more, I‚Äôll say the word, relevant learning experiences because I truly believe that relevance is not necessarily a word that we‚Äôve used in higher education in terms of our approach, but now more than ever we‚Äôre going to have to. 

FASKIANOS: OK. 

So I‚Äôm going to take a written question from Nicole Muthoni, who is an entrepreneur and innovator at the University of Connecticut. She has been passionately working on bridging the divide in emergent nations, especially Kenya. Therefore, in this regard, the key factors creating the digital divide in this space is geographic causes, socioeconomic factors, and culture.

So the question is what tools and programs can we use to effectively educate teachers to learn the necessary skills that they can use to teach their students in the classrooms. This is because most of the teachers have not been empowered with the necessary and needed skills for educating in the space of digital equity.

BROWNLEE: I think‚ÄîI began to speak to that right towards the end of what I was just sharing, right. 

FASKIANOS: Right.

BROWNLEE: It‚Äôs this idea of we‚Äôve got to get out of the blame game. Oh, I want you to come up with the solution. Well, how are you investing in me to be a part of the solution? How are you even engaging me in part of being the solution? 

You know, as I talked earlier about those conversations we‚Äôre having at CCA about what are those programs that have been unsustainable or times have shifted and changed and we needed to create some more relevant learning experiences. It is our faculty and our instructors that made that decision to be able to say, hey, it‚Äôs time to pivot.

They were at the table. Not just present for the sake of inclusion but, truly, the decision makers in that work. Now, I think, the next component of this work as we talked about achieving the dream and us being the first in the state of Colorado, part of our strategic plan is creating a‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have a name so just work with me here conceptually.

We don‚Äôt have a name yet. But I can tell you what the desired outcome is, and the desired outcome is that we create a learning center for our faculty and our instructors to grow and to be invested in and to learn what are those emerging approaches that will‚Äîon the verge of becoming best practices. However, they‚Äôre not, quote/unquote, ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù around the country yet.

What could we create here at CCA to be a part of those solutions? And also exposure to national best practice. What are we doing to invest into our people? 

So I think that part of that shifting that Dr. Glasper was calling out is going to have to occur now more than ever because, unfortunately, what‚Äôs happened, I think, in the academy too many of our instructors and faculty have been blamed. 

Too many of our staff had been blamed, not engaged and brought about to be the solution, and not just thrown right out there in the fire to say come up with something.

No. You need to care for your folks more deeply, more passionately, and more genuinely than we have ever before and really ask the question how are we going to be relevant and make sure that our folks feel cared for and that they‚Äôre valued in the spaces in which they‚Äôre serving.

FASKIANOS: Thank you. 

So the next question is from Krishna Garza-Baker from the University of Texas at San Antonio. What would you say is the role of private service providers and their ability to assist in reducing the digital divide? 

Are they doing enough to collaborate with higher education institutions to address this area, specifically, internet service providers? 

And I‚Äôm going to add on to that. What are your recommendations for how schools can and should be leveraging corporate and community partnerships to help address the digital divide?

BROWNLEE: You know, you heard me earlier talk about how we can‚Äôt just do this overlay approach. 

Yes, I want to give you a voucher for reduced broadband access. That‚Äôs wonderful. It is. It is grateful. It‚Äôs better than not having it.

But now let‚Äôs talk about how we‚Äôre truly going to hardline in opportunities for all. As we think about the spirit of advocacy, unfortunately, sometimes, as they say, it‚Äôs the squeaky wheel gets the grease, I think, is how it‚Äôs communicated. 

And so what I would say is, is that now we have to think about those that don‚Äôt have a voice how we‚Äôre still meeting their needs. And so working directly with corporate industry partners, those who have the access. What does it look like if we focus less on trying to make a dollar and more on trying to create opportunity? What would it look like if we all came about and said we want to be the solution to the issue? 

Yes, there‚Äôs areas and opportunities where we‚Äôll make that dollar. But as we think about society as a whole, what does it look like to create experiences and a life for the goodness of all? And so I think that now we really more than ever have to have these conversations. 

More than ever it just can‚Äôt be who gets the voucher. It‚Äôs how do you create the accessibility for all, those who have a voice and those who know how to use their voice. And I think that‚Äîif I understand the nature of that question now, I will say with private entities, corporate partnerships, I think it‚Äôs more visibility in these colleges and universities and these nonprofit spaces beyond the cameras and just looking at the campaigns. 

What does it look like for us to have the conversations day in and day out to say we‚Äôre neighbors, we‚Äôre all going to collectively be a part of the solutions and to bring the rising up, if you will, of our communities to raise the level for all and that‚Äôs, certainly, what we‚Äôre seeking to do. 

We‚Äôve seen some major responsiveness in this particular community to say, listen, outside of just some campaign and a picture, what does it look like for you all to be a part of our learning experience, a part of our community, a part of our solutions, and to hardline these experiences for all.

So equity causes and it charges and it demands that, and we have to realize the power of that.

FASKIANOS: Thank you. 

I‚Äôm going to take the next question from Laila Bichara from SUNY Farmingdale.

Many of my students are immigrants and are first-generation college students. My question is about skill transfer‚Äîonce our students get access to technology for themselves and their families who are then losing their jobs due to automation. 

BROWNLEE: Demographic shift. I talked about it earlier.

You know, I think about here in the Denver Metro area and I‚Äôm going to‚ÄîI attended a site visit conversation with their chamber of commerce there in Denver. It was pretty telling. 

In looking at the demographics, it broke down how for millennials, I think, there‚Äôs currently‚Äîso there‚Äôs 3.3 million in the greater Denver area. It broke down for millennials, which I fall into this group‚ÄîI think it was eight hundred and sixty-four thousand millennials currently in that space.

Then it had Xers. Not Xers. It had generation Z. Z accounted for, roughly, six hundred thousand. But get this. So my children, my eight- and my four-year-old‚Äîthey‚Äôre generation alpha‚Äîwere only accounting for, roughly, three hundred thousand in the space currently right now. 

I say that as an example that I‚Äôm going to walk us through really quickly, and that is, is with the lens of equity and we think about the shifting and the disruptions in market and we think about especially now in the markets humanization versus automation, and we want to create social and economic mobility for these respective spaces wherever those realities are and we think about accessibility to the internet and we talk about that digital equity and the digital divide, we then have to have a high degree of urgency within us to say that what will‚Äîcan we create today that will prevent communities of color and low socioeconomic communities that traditionally in this current market would have been given opportunities but that in the future market, due to a lack of potential skill and accessibility, will not be provided the resources and the opportunities that they once were in an automated world. 

And so what do we do then to make sure that they‚Äôre not the one pressing the button. They‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs coding the button, right, and that‚Äôs all a part of that work and that shifting. So it‚Äôs going to take stronger math and science skills and accessibility and equity all built into their learning experiences because if not the wide‚Äîwe will widen the gap‚Äîthe poverty gap‚Äîbecause we move, again, deeper into automation, lessen the humanization, and then we are essentially moving an entire population of folks further down the supply chain, if you will, which then will prohibit their learning‚Äînot learning, their earning ability. 

And so we have to be laser focused on those realities and, really, look to eradicate what‚Äôs going to be future barriers now so systematically we are able to address it. 

FASKIANOS: Great. 

So the last question I wanted to ask you is you‚Äôve just completed your first year as president. What are the lessons that you‚Äôve learned? 

BROWNLEE: Oh, my gosh. I will tell you that, you know, I just released an article on this talking about my first year in the presidency and through EdSurge and lessons learned, and one of those lessons I would say is is‚Äîthat I highlighted in that article is, you know, don‚Äôt do more for an institution than you would do for your own family. 

I think that as educators, as community leaders, and anyone that‚Äôs on this call, I‚Äôll just take the opportunity to encourage you. You know, sometimes we give our all to these entities in which we serve, and we do it and we give it countless hours. You know, we say it‚Äôs a forty-hour job but we‚Äôre probably spending fifty, sixty, seventy, if not more, and we get lost in that, right.

And so there‚Äôs good work to be done. However, what is the biggest mockery of all to save the world but lose your own family? And I think that part of my lesson that I had to really reflect on was, like, right now as I‚Äôm giving this lecture my eight-year-old son is here in the office with me right now that I‚Äôm trying to get to be quiet and work with me as I‚Äôm giving‚Äîhaving this time with you all now, right. He doesn‚Äôt have school today. It‚Äôs an in-service day. 

But really creating those engagements for my family to be engaged in the experiences and making sure that they‚Äôre part of the process. 

I think the other component of this is, too‚Äîand I talked about this in the article‚Äîis realizing that it is a privilege to serve, never taking for granted the ability, the opportunity, that we have to serve because there‚Äôs others that wish that they had these opportunities. 

So, yes, even in our most‚Äîour days of most frustration it still is a pleasure and a blessing and an opportunity to serve and honor. 

And so what would life look like if we embraced it for the pleasure and the honor that it truly is and how we treat and create spaces for others to thrive, because they‚Äôre sacrificing being away from their families and loved ones to do this work. We need to create more communities for all to thrive. 

FASKIANOS: Oh, your son should be very proud of you. I have to say that‚Äîwhat a role model. 

BROWNLEE: Thank you.

FASKIANOS: I‚Äôm going to go next to Laurette Foster.

Laurette, please say your affiliation. It‚Äôs great to have you on.

Q: Hi. Laurette Foster, Prairie View A&M University in Texas. 

And I really don‚Äôt have a question. I just want to say how delighted I was to hear the conversation and hear about what the next steps are, because looking back at the pandemic and how we wanted to step up and do so much and I‚Äôm just afraid that even though we did those things that needed to be done that many of us now are settling back into the old ways.

And it‚Äôs still funny that when you told the story about the tribal community happened to go to the top of the mountain from 2:00 in the morning to do‚Äîthe passion for education is there with the kids. But we have to continue to do our part. 

So I just appreciate all the comments and‚Äîthat you did today. It was really enlightening. So thank you very much. 

BROWNLEE: And thank you, and I will say that my wife is a proud product of Prairie View A&M. The Hill as well. So just thank you for your comments. 

FASKIANOS: We have another thank you from John Marks of LSU of Alexandria just saying that it was really great to take time out of his day and to‚Äîsaid they‚Äîdefinitely in Louisiana access and skills are, indeed, real obstacles that are typical of every online class that he‚Äôs taught. 

I‚Äôm going to take the final question from Haetham Abdul-Razaq from Northwest Vista College, again, from San Antonio, Texas, working on a research project regarding online learning and community college students. 

One of the interesting findings is that some students might be considered as tech savvy, yet they have problems engaging in online classes. Do you think that we should build on the strengths of our students‚Äô digital knowledge when it comes to these sorts of skills?

BROWNLEE: Great question. 

Absolutely. I think, you know, we talk about creating student-centered approaches and sometimes we‚Äôre successful at that and other times we‚Äôre not, perhaps, because if we were to really delve into student-centered approaches just how far from our base currently of how we approach higher education just how far it‚Äôll take us. 

But I would say, going back to an earlier conversation, now‚Äôs the time more than ever to go there. Matter of fact, we should have went there already before. It‚Äôs time, truly, for a revolution and an evolution in our approach to learning and engagement and advancement with an equity lens. 

And I go back to that word relevance. We have to create more relevant learning experiences. Think about business and industry. If we look at what‚Äôs happened over the past ten years due to some of our bureaucracies and our lack of responsiveness.

Look at business and industry. They‚Äôre creating learning experiences right around higher education, in some cases not even engaging higher education anymore, directly working with middle schools and high schools to create their own strong pipelines. What has happened that that even came about, right? 

And so due to a lack of responsiveness, perhaps, innovation‚Äîtrue innovation‚Äîand that student-centered approach that we, perhaps, moved far from or maybe just took parts of that was easier to tackle, not the harder aspects of that, and so we now have to tackle it. 

We have to embrace it, because if not I think that five, ten years from now, certainly, twenty years from now, we‚Äôll have more institutional closures, more reductions in enrollments, if we fail to be responsive and create these more equitable learning opportunities that are geared at creating a digital equity. 

FASKIANOS: Right. Well, we are just at the end of our time.

Thank you very much, Dr. Mordecai Brownlee. We really appreciate your being with us and sharing your insights, and to all of you for your questions and comments. 

And so you can follow Dr. Mordecai and also go to his website, itsdrmordecai.com, and at @itsdrmordecai, correct?

BROWNLEE: That is correct. That is correct. I look forward to engaging with everyone. 

FASKIANOS: Wonderful. We really appreciate it. 

Just as a reminder for all of you, our next Higher Education webinar will be on Wednesday, November 2, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time.

          Cherry Tree Myth
        

















""Father, I Can Not Tell a Lie: I Cut the Tree,"" engraving by John C. McRae, 1867.

The cherry tree myth is one of the oldest and best-known legends about George Washington. In the original story, when Washington was six years old, he received a hatchet as a gift and damaged his father‚Äôs cherry tree with it. When his father discovered what George had done, he became angry. Young George bravely said, ‚ÄúI cannot tell a lie‚Ä¶I did cut it with my hatchet.‚Äù Washington‚Äôs father embraced him and declared that his son‚Äôs honesty was worth more than a thousand trees.1
Origin
This iconic story about the value of honesty was invented by one of Washington‚Äôs first biographers, a traveling minister and bookseller named Mason Locke Weems. After Washington‚Äôs death in 1799, people were anxious to learn about the first President. Weems explained to a publisher in January 1800:

""Washington you know is gone! Millions are gaping to read something about him...My plan! I give his history, sufficiently minute‚Ä¶I then go on to show that his unparalleled rise and elevation were due to his Great Virtues.""2

Weems's biography, The Life of Washington, was first published in 1800. It became an instant bestseller due to its approachable style. However, the cherry tree myth did not appear until the book's fifth edition in 1806.
Weems had several motives when he wrote The Life of Washington. Money was certainly one of them. He rightly guessed that if he wrote a popular history book about Washington it would sell.



Cover page of the 1840 edition of Weem's Life of Washington. The book's subtitle shows how important Weems thought the anecdotes were to his book's central purpose to make Washington a role model for his ""Young Countrymen.""

A Federalist admirer of order and self-discipline, Weems also wanted to present Washington as the perfect role model, especially for young Americans. The cherry tree myth and other stories told readers that Washington's public greatness was due to his private virtues. Washington's achievements as a General and President were familiar to people in the early nineteenth century, but little was known about his relationship with his father, who died when Washington was only eleven years old.3  There is almost no surviving historical evidence about Washington's relationship with his father, and Weems‚Äô claims have never been verified.4
As a result of his success, Weems is now considered one of the fathers of popular history. Even Abraham Lincoln recalled reading the book as a child.5
Development in the Nineteenth Century



Mason Locke Weems, by an unidentified artist, c.1810. Number NPG.95.190, National Portrait Gallery.

In the 1830s, William Holmes McGuffey turned Weems' tale into a children's story to be included in his textbooks. McGuffey was a Presbyterian minister and a college professor who wrote about teaching morals and religion to children. First published in 1836, McGuffey's Readers remained in print for nearly a hundred years and sold over 120 million copies. It taught the myth of the cherry tree to millions of American students.
McGuffey's version of the cherry tree myth appeared in his The Eclectic Second Reader for almost twenty years. McGuffey made Washington's language more formal, and he showed more respect to his father's authority. For example, when Washington's father explains the sin of lying, Weems says Washington spoke ‚Äúvery seriously while McGuffey has young George respond tearfully.6¬†Follow-up questions at the end of McGuffey‚Äôs cherry tree story reinforce its message: ‚ÄúHow did his father feel toward him when he made his confession? What may we expect by confessing our faults?""7
The Cherry Tree myth also appeared outside of books, as the case of Joice Heth shows. Joice Heth was an elderly enslaved woman purchased by P.T. Barnum in 1835. He made her into a sideshow attraction, billing her as an enslaved woman who had raised George Washington. (If true, this would have made her 161 years old.) The stories she told about Washington, including the cherry tree myth, were right out of Weems‚Äô writing. Many people saw Heth as credible because she was telling stories that people already knew.8
Legacy
The cherry tree myth has endured for more than two hundred years. It remains influential in Americans' beliefs about Washington. It has been referenced in countless books, movies, and television shows. The story has been featured in comic strips and cartoons, especially in political cartoons.

A mammal (from Latin  mamma¬†'breast')[1] is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia (/m…ôÀàme…™li.…ô/). Mammals are characterised by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300¬†million years ago. Around 6,640 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 27 orders.[2] The study of mammals is called mammalogy.
The largest orders of mammals, by number of species, are the rodents, bats, and eulipotyphlans (including hedgehogs, moles and shrews). The next three are the primates (including humans, monkeys and lemurs), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs, camels, and whales), and the Carnivora (including cats, dogs, and seals).
Mammals are the only living members of Synapsida; this clade, together with Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), constitutes the larger Amniota clade. Early synapsids are referred to as ""pelycosaurs."" The more advanced therapsids became dominant during the Guadalupian. Mammals originated from cynodonts, an advanced group of therapsids, during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. Mammals achieved their modern diversity in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been the dominant terrestrial animal group from 66¬†million years ago to the present.
The basic mammalian body type is quadrupedal, with most mammals using four limbs for terrestrial locomotion; but in some, the limbs are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees or underground. The bipeds have adapted to move using only the two lower limbs, while the rear limbs of cetaceans and the sea cows are mere internal vestiges. Mammals range in size from the 30‚Äì40 millimetres (1.2‚Äì1.6¬†in) bumblebee bat to the 30 metres (98¬†ft) blue whale‚Äîpossibly the largest animal to have ever lived. Maximum lifespan varies from two years for the shrew to 211 years for the bowhead whale. All modern mammals give birth to live young, except the five species of monotremes, which lay eggs. The most species-rich group is the viviparous placental mammals, so named for the temporary organ (placenta) used by offspring to draw nutrition from the mother during gestation.
Most mammals are intelligent, with some possessing large brains, self-awareness, and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalise in several ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent marking, alarm signals, singing, echolocation; and, in the case of humans, complex language. Mammals can organise themselves into fission‚Äìfusion societies, harems, and hierarchies‚Äîbut can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.
Domestication of many types of mammals by humans played a major role in the Neolithic Revolution, and resulted in farming replacing hunting and gathering as the primary source of food for humans. This led to a major restructuring of human societies from nomadic to sedentary, with more co-operation among larger and larger groups, and ultimately the development of the first civilisations. Domesticated mammals provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as food (meat and dairy products), fur, and leather. Mammals are also hunted and raced for sport, kept as pets and working animals of various types, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Paleolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Decline in numbers and extinction of many mammals is primarily driven by human poaching and habitat destruction, primarily deforestation.

Mammal classification has been through several revisions since Carl Linnaeus initially defined the class, and at present[when?], no classification system is universally accepted. McKenna & Bell (1997) and Wilson & Reeder (2005) provide useful recent compendiums.[3] Simpson (1945)[4] provides systematics of mammal origins and relationships that had been taught universally until the end of the 20th¬†century.
However, since 1945, a large amount of new and more detailed information has gradually been found: The paleontological record has been recalibrated, and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematisation itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics. Though fieldwork and lab work progressively outdated Simpson's classification, it remains the closest thing to an official classification of mammals, despite its known issues.[5]
Most mammals, including the six most species-rich orders, belong to the placental group. The three largest orders in numbers of species are Rodentia: mice, rats, porcupines, beavers, capybaras, and other gnawing mammals; Chiroptera: bats; and Eulipotyphla: shrews, moles, and solenodons. The next three biggest orders, depending on the biological classification scheme used, are the primates: apes, monkeys, and lemurs; Cetartiodactyla: whales and even-toed ungulates; and Carnivora which includes cats, dogs, weasels, bears, seals, and allies.[6] According to Mammal Species of the World, 5,416¬†species were identified in 2006. These were grouped into 1,229¬†genera, 153¬†families and 29¬†orders.[6] In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) completed a five-year Global Mammal Assessment for its IUCN Red List, which counted 5,488¬†species.[7] According to research published in the Journal of Mammalogy in 2018, the number of recognised mammal species is 6,495, including 96¬†recently extinct.[8]

Definitions 
The word ""mammal"" is modern, from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin mamma (""teat, pap""). In an influential 1988 paper, Timothy Rowe defined Mammalia phylogenetically as the crown group of mammals, the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of living monotremes (echidnas and platypuses) and therians (marsupials and placentals) and all descendants of that ancestor.[9] Since this ancestor lived in the Jurassic period, Rowe's definition excludes all animals from the earlier Triassic, despite the fact that Triassic fossils in the Haramiyida have been referred to the Mammalia since the mid-19th century.[10] If Mammalia is considered as the crown group, its origin can be roughly dated as the first known appearance of animals more closely related to some extant mammals than to others. Ambondro is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while Amphilestes and Amphitherium are more closely related to the therians; as fossils of all three genera are dated about 167 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic, this is a reasonable estimate for the appearance of the crown group.[11]
T. S. Kemp has provided a more traditional definition: ""Synapsids that possess a dentary‚Äìsquamosal jaw articulation and occlusion between upper and lower molars with a transverse component to the movement"" or, equivalently in Kemp's view, the clade originating with the last common ancestor of Sinoconodon and living mammals.[12] The earliest-known synapsid satisfying Kemp's definitions is Tikitherium, dated 225 Ma, so the appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given this Late Triassic date.[13][14] However, this animal may have actually evolved during the Neogene.[15]

Molecular classification of placentals
Genus-level molecular phylogeny of 116 extant mammals inferred from the gene tree information of 14,509 coding DNA sequences.[16] The major clades are coloured: marsupials (magenta), xenarthrans (orange), afrotherians (red), laurasiatherians (green), and euarchontoglirans (blue).
As of the early 21st century, molecular studies based on DNA analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data.[17] Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placentals‚ÄîAfrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria‚Äîwhich diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria).[18] Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages‚ÄîEuarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.
Estimates for the divergence times between these three placental groups range from 105 to 120¬†million years ago, depending on the type of DNA used (such as nuclear or mitochondrial)[19] and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data.[18]

Evolution

Origins
Synapsida, a clade that contains mammals and their extinct relatives, originated during the Pennsylvanian subperiod (~323¬†million to ~300¬†million years ago), when they split from the reptile lineage. Crown group mammals evolved from earlier mammaliaforms during the Early Jurassic. The cladogram takes Mammalia to be the crown group.[21]

Evolution from older amniotes
The original synapsid skull structure contains one temporal opening behind the orbitals, in a fairly low position on the skull (lower right in this image). This opening might have assisted in containing the jaw muscles of these organisms which could have increased their biting strength.
The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious early tetrapod predecessors, they had lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes that allow the developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.
The first amniotes apparently arose in the Pennsylvanian subperiod of the Carboniferous. They descended from earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods,[22] which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as ferns, mosses and other plants. Within a few million years, two important amniote lineages became distinct: the synapsids, which would later include the common ancestor of the mammals; and the sauropsids, which now include turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians and dinosaurs (including birds).[23] Synapsids have a single hole (temporal fenestra) low on each side of the skull. Primitive synapsids included the largest and fiercest animals of the early Permian such as Dimetrodon.[24] Nonmammalian synapsids were traditionally‚Äîand incorrectly‚Äîcalled ""mammal-like reptiles"" or pelycosaurs; we now know they were neither reptiles nor part of reptile lineage.[25][26]
Therapsids, a group of synapsids, evolved in the Middle Permian, about 265¬†million years ago, and became the dominant land vertebrates.[25] They differ from basal eupelycosaurs in several features of the skull and jaws, including: larger skulls and incisors which are equal in size in therapsids, but not for eupelycosaurs.[25] The therapsid lineage leading to mammals went through a series of stages, beginning with animals that were very similar to their early synapsid ancestors and ending with probainognathian cynodonts, some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals. Those stages were characterised by:[27]

The gradual development of a bony secondary palate.
Abrupt acquisition of endothermy among Mammaliamorpha, thus prior to the origin of mammals by 30‚Äì50 millions of years [28].
Progression towards an erect limb posture, which would increase the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process was slow and erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs.
The dentary gradually became the main bone of the lower jaw which, by the Triassic, progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the jaws of reptiles).
First mammals
The Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event about 252¬†million years ago, which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of carnivorous therapsids.[29] In the early Triassic, most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs[30] which, over an extended period (35¬†million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs,[31] the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs;[32] however, large cynodonts like Trucidocynodon and traversodontids still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively. By the Jurassic, the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well.[33]
The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) appeared in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225¬†million years ago), 40¬†million years after the first therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards;[34] the Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, was a close relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish.[35] Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits.[36] The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids.[37] The earliest-known fossil of the Metatheria (""changed beasts"") is Sinodelphys, found in 125-million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.[38]

Restoration of Juramaia sinensis, the oldest-known eutherian (160 mya)[39]
The oldest-known fossil among the Eutheria (""true beasts"") is the small shrewlike Juramaia sinensis, or ""Jurassic mother from China"", dated to 160¬†million years ago in the late Jurassic.[39] A later eutherian relative, Eomaia, dated to 125¬†million years ago in the early Cretaceous, possessed some features in common with the marsupials but not with the placentals, evidence that these features were present in the last common ancestor of the two groups but were later lost in the placental lineage.[40] In particular, the epipubic bones extend forwards from the pelvis. These are not found in any modern placental, but they are found in marsupials, monotremes, other nontherian mammals and Ukhaatherium, an early Cretaceous animal in the eutherian order Asioryctitheria. This also applies to the multituberculates.[41] They are apparently an ancestral feature, which subsequently disappeared in the placental lineage. These epipubic bones seem to function by stiffening the muscles during locomotion, reducing the amount of space being presented, which placentals require to contain their fetus during gestation periods. A narrow pelvic outlet indicates that the young were very small at birth and therefore pregnancy was short, as in modern marsupials. This suggests that the placenta was a later development.[42]
One of the earliest-known monotremes was Teinolophos, which lived about 120¬†million years ago in Australia.[43] Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca)‚Äîas reptiles and birds also do‚Äî[44] and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.[45]

Earliest appearances of features
Hadrocodium, whose fossils date from approximately 195¬†million years ago, in the early Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.[46]

Fossil of Thrinaxodon at the National Museum of Natural History
The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164¬†million years ago in the mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones in the front of the upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of hair or fur;[47][48] it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon.[26][49] Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon.[50] Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.[51]
When endothermy first appeared in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids.[51][52] Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals,[53] but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians.[54] Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures.[55]
The evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete‚Äîliving and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared sometime in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it is found in the eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys, both dated to 125¬†million years ago.[56] Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and Mammaliaformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental Mammaliaformes, though Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium appear to have lacked them.[57]
It has been suggested that the original function of lactation (milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals.[58][59] In human females, mammary glands become fully developed during puberty, regardless of pregnancy.[60]

Rise of the mammals
Hyaenodon horridus at the Royal Ontario Museum. The genus Hyaenodon was among the most successful mammals of the late Eocene-early Miocene epochs spanning for most of the Paleogene and some of the Neogene periods, undergoing many endemic radiations in North America, Europe, and Asia.[61]
Therians took over the medium- to large-sized ecological niches in the Cenozoic, after the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event approximately 66¬†million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non-avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles, as well as various other mammal groups,[62] and underwent an exponential increase in body size (megafauna).[63] The increase in mammalian diversity was not, however, solely because of expansion into large-bodied niches.[64] Mammals diversified very quickly, displaying an exponential rise in diversity.[62] For example, the earliest-known bat dates from about 50¬†million years ago, only 16¬†million years after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.[65]
Molecular phylogenetic studies initially suggested that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85¬†million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene.[66] However, no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous.[67] The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early Paleocene, after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.[67] (Scientists identified an early Paleocene animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals,[68] but it has since been reclassified as a non-placental eutherian.)[69] Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a Late Cretaceous origin for placentals, and a Paleocene origin for most modern clades.[70]
The earliest-known ancestor of primates is Archicebus achilles[71] from around 55¬†million years ago.[71] This tiny primate weighed 20‚Äì30 grams (0.7‚Äì1.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm.[71]


Anatomy
Distinguishing features
Living mammal species can be identified by the presence of sweat glands, including those that are specialised to produce milk to nourish their young.[72] In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils.[73]
Many traits shared by all living mammals appeared among the earliest members of the group:

Jaw joint ‚Äì The dentary (the lower jaw bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet to form the joint. In most gnathostomes, including early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone at the back of the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw).[46]
Middle ear ‚Äì In crown-group mammals, sound is carried from the eardrum by a chain of three bones, the malleus, the incus and the stapes. Ancestrally, the malleus and the incus are derived from the articular and the quadrate bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids.[74]
Tooth replacement ‚Äì Teeth can be replaced once (diphyodonty) or (as in toothed whales and murid rodents) not at all (monophyodonty).[75] Elephants, manatees, and kangaroos continually grow new teeth throughout their life (polyphyodonty).[76]
Prismatic enamel ‚Äì The enamel coating on the surface of a tooth consists of prisms, solid, rod-like structures extending from the dentin to the tooth's surface.[77]
Occipital condyles ‚Äì Two knobs at the base of the skull fit into the topmost neck vertebra; most other tetrapods, in contrast, have only one such knob.[78]
For the most part, these characteristics were not present in the Triassic ancestors of the mammals.[79] Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone, the exception being modern placentals.[80]

Sexual dimorphism
Sexual dimorphism in aurochs, the extinct wild ancestor of cattle
On average, male mammals are larger than females, with males being at least 10% larger than females in over 45% of investigated species. Most mammalian orders also exhibit male-biased sexual dimorphism, although some orders do not show any bias or are significantly female-biased (Lagomorpha). Sexual size dimorphism increases with body size across mammals (Rensch's rule), suggesting that there are parallel selection pressures on both male and female size. Male-biased dimorphism relates to sexual selection on males through male‚Äìmale competition for females, as there is a positive correlation between the degree of sexual selection, as indicated by mating systems, and the degree of male-biased size dimorphism. The degree of sexual selection is also positively correlated with male and female size across mammals. Further, parallel selection pressure on female mass is identified in that age at weaning is significantly higher in more polygynous species, even when correcting for body mass. Also, the reproductive rate is lower for larger females, indicating that fecundity selection selects for smaller females in mammals. Although these patterns hold across mammals as a whole, there is considerable variation across orders.[81]

Biological systems
Main article: Biological system
The majority of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck). The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine.[82] All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals.[83] Placental brains have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.[84]

Didactic models of a mammalian heart
Circulatory systems
The mammalian heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers.[85] The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in the correct direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via one of the four pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.[86]

Respiratory systems
Raccoon lungs being inflated manually
Main article: Respiratory system ¬ß¬†Mammals
The lungs of mammals are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly achieved with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing the volume of the lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient.[87][88] This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.[88]


Integumentary systems
Mammal skin: (1) hair, (2) epidermis, (3) sebaceous gland, (4) Arrector pili muscle, (5) dermis, (6) hair follicle, (7) sweat gland. Not labelled, the bottom layer: hypodermis, showing round adipocytes
The integumentary system (skin) is made up of three layers: the outermost epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis. The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer. Its outermost cells are constantly lost; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward. The middle layer, the dermis, is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis. The dermis is made up of many components, such as bony structures and blood vessels. The hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue, which stores lipids and provides cushioning and insulation. The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species;[89]:‚Ää97‚Ää marine mammals require a thick hypodermis (blubber) for insulation, and right whales have the thickest blubber at 20 inches (51¬†cm).[90] Although other animals have features such as whiskers, feathers, setae, or cilia that superficially resemble it, no animals other than mammals have hair. It is a definitive characteristic of the class, though some mammals have very little.[89]:‚Ää61‚Ää

Digestive systems
The carnassials (teeth in the very back of the mouth) of the insectivorous aardwolf (left) versus that of a grey wolf (right) which consumes large vertebrates
Herbivores have developed a diverse range of physical structures to facilitate the consumption of plant material. To break up intact plant tissues, mammals have developed teeth structures that reflect their feeding preferences. For instance, frugivores (animals that feed primarily on fruit) and herbivores that feed on soft foliage have low-crowned teeth specialised for grinding foliage and seeds. Grazing animals that tend to eat hard, silica-rich grasses, have high-crowned teeth, which are capable of grinding tough plant tissues and do not wear down as quickly as low-crowned teeth.[91] Most carnivorous mammals have carnassial teeth (of varying length depending on diet), long canines and similar tooth replacement patterns.[92]
The stomach of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla) is divided into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only ruminants have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump together to form a bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulolytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants.[93] Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria.[94] Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibres. The cecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.[95]

Excretory and genitourinary systems
Bovine kidney
Genitourinary system of a male and female rabbit
The mammalian excretory system involves many components. Like most other land animals, mammals are ureotelic, and convert ammonia into urea, which is done by the liver as part of the urea cycle.[96] Bilirubin, a waste product derived from blood cells, is passed through bile and urine with the help of enzymes excreted by the liver.[97] The passing of bilirubin via bile through the intestinal tract gives mammalian feces a distinctive brown coloration.[98] Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids, and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla, which is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle. Only the mammalian kidney has a bean shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds, cetaceans and bears.[99][100] Most adult placentals have no remaining trace of the cloaca. In the embryo, the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus, and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual: in females, it develops into the vestibule or urogenital sinus that receives the urethra and vagina, while in males it forms the entirety of the penile urethra.[100][101] However, the afrosoricids and some shrews retain a cloaca as adults.[102] In marsupials, the genital tract is separate from the anus, but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally.[100] Monotremes, which translates from Greek into ""single hole"", have a true cloaca.[103] Urine flows from the ureters into the cloaca in monotremes and into the bladder in placentals.[100]

Sound production
A diagram of ultrasonic signals emitted by a bat, and the echo from a nearby object
As in all other tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and surrounding musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.[104]

Beluga whale echolocation sounds
Some mammals have a large larynx and thus a low-pitched voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx can take up the entirety of the thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen.[105] Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats.[106] The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales.[107][108] Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produce ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to lower the resonances or increase the volume of sound.[104]
The vocal production system is controlled by the cranial nerve nuclei in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalisations. The ability to learn new vocalisations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, elephants and possibly bats; in humans, this is the result of a direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.[104]

The primary function of the fur of mammals is thermoregulation. Others include protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflage.[109] Different types of fur serve different purposes:[89]:‚Ää99‚Ää

Definitive ‚Äì which may be shed after reaching a certain length
Vibrissae ‚Äì sensory hairs, most commonly whiskers
Pelage ‚Äì guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair
Spines ‚Äì stiff guard hair used for defence (such as in porcupines)
Bristles ‚Äì long hairs usually used in visual signals. (such as a lion's mane)
Velli ‚Äì often called ""down fur"" which insulates newborn mammals
Wool ‚Äì long, soft and often curly
Thermoregulation
Hair length is not a factor in thermoregulation: for example, some tropical mammals such as sloths have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the musk ox has guard hairs measuring 30¬†cm (12¬†in) as well as a dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of ‚àí40¬†¬∞C (‚àí40¬†¬∞F).[89]:‚Ää162‚Äì163‚Ää Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach 70¬†¬∞C (158¬†¬∞F) in the summer, but the skin stays at 40¬†¬∞C (104¬†¬∞F).[89]:‚Ää188‚Ää Aquatic mammals, conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry.[89]:‚Ää162‚Äì163‚Ää

Coloration
Mammalian coats are coloured for a variety of reasons, the major selective pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication, and thermoregulation. Coloration in both the hair and skin of mammals is mainly determined by the type and amount of melanin; eumelanins for brown and black colours and pheomelanin for a range of yellowish to reddish colours, giving mammals an earth tone.[110][111] Some mammals have more vibrant colours; certain monkeys such mandrills and vervet monkeys, and opossums such as the Mexican mouse opossums and Derby's woolly opossums, have blue skin due to light diffraction in collagen fibres.[112] Many sloths appear green because their fur hosts green algae; this may be a symbiotic relation that affords camouflage to the sloths.[113]
Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey.[114] In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage.[115] Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution.[112]
Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger.[116] Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species.[117] Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection.[118] Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker coloured coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.[89]:‚Ää166‚Äì167‚Ää[109] The dazzling black-and-white striping of zebras appear to provide some protection from biting flies.[119]

Reproductive system
Main article: Mammalian reproduction
Goat kids stay with their mother until they are weaned.
Mammals reproduce by internal fertilisation[120] and are solely gonochoric (an animal is born with either male or female genitalia, as opposed to hermaphrodites where there is no such schism).[121]  Male mammals inseminate females during copulation and ejaculate semen through a penis, which may be contained in a prepuce when not erect. Male placentals also urinate through a penis, and some placentals also have a penis bone (baculum).[122][123][120] Marsupials typically have forked penises,[124] while the echidna penis generally has four heads with only two functioning.[125] Depending on the species, an erection may be fuelled by blood flow into vascular, spongy tissue or by muscular action.[122]  The testicles of most mammals descend into the scrotum which is typically posterior to the penis but is often anterior in marsupials. Female mammals generally have a vulva (clitoris and labia) on the outside, while the internal system contains paired oviducts, one or two uteri, one or two cervices and a vagina.[126][127] Marsupials have two lateral vaginas and a medial vagina. The ""vagina"" of monotremes is better understood as a ""urogenital sinus"". The uterine systems of placentals can vary between a duplex, where there are two uteri and cervices which open into the vagina, a bipartite, where two uterine horns have a single cervix that connects to the vagina, a bicornuate, which consists where two uterine horns that are connected distally but separate medially creating a Y-shape, and a simplex, which has a single uterus.[128][129][89]:‚Ää220‚Äì221,‚Ää247‚Ää

Matschie's tree-kangaroo with young in pouch
The ancestral condition for mammal reproduction is the birthing of relatively undeveloped young, either through direct vivipary or a short period as soft-shelled eggs. This is likely due to the fact that the torso could not expand due to the presence of epipubic bones. The oldest demonstration of this reproductive style is with Kayentatherium, which produced undeveloped perinates, but at much higher litter sizes than any modern mammal, 38 specimens.[130] Most modern mammals are viviparous, giving birth to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The monotremes have a sex-determination system different from that of most other mammals.[131] In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal.[132]
Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and generally giving birth to a number of undeveloped newborns that then undergo further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located in the front of the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placentals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy.[80] Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way.[41] The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods.[133] They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.[134] In placentals, the epipubic is either completely lost or converted into the baculum; allowing the torso to be able to expand and thus birth developed offspring.[130]
The mammary glands of mammals are specialised to produce milk, the primary source of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the teats seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly.[135] Compared to placental mammals, the milk of marsupials changes greatly in both production rate and in nutrient composition, due to the underdeveloped young. In addition, the mammary glands have more autonomy allowing them to supply separate milks to young at different development stages.[136] Lactose is the main sugar in placental milk while monotreme and marsupial milk is dominated by oligosaccharides.[137] Weaning is the process in which a mammal becomes less dependent on their mother's milk and more on solid food.[138]

Endothermy
Nearly all mammals are endothermic (""warm-blooded""). Most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic (""cold-blooded"") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles.[139] Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm.[140] Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy is not unique to mammals.[141]

Species lifespan
See also: Life expectancy and Maximum life span
Among mammals, species maximum lifespan varies significantly (for example the shrew has a lifespan of two years, whereas the oldest bowhead whale is recorded to be 211 years).[142] Although the underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain, numerous studies indicate that the ability to repair DNA damage is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan. In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow,[143] it was found that DNA excision repair capability increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species. Species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with the capacity to recognise DNA double-strand breaks as well as the level of the DNA repair protein Ku80.[142] In a study of the cells from sixteen mammalian species, genes employed in DNA repair were found to be up-regulated in the longer-lived species.[144] The cellular level of the DNA repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase was found to correlate with species lifespan in a study of 13 mammalian species.[145] Three additional studies of a variety of mammalian species also reported a correlation between species lifespan and DNA repair capability.[146][147][148]

Running gait. Photographs by Eadweard Muybridge, 1887
Most vertebrates‚Äîthe amphibians, the reptiles and some mammals such as humans and bears‚Äîare plantigrade, walking on the whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed.[149] A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters[150] and platypuses[151] are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.[152][153]
Animals will use different gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, then there are three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces.[154] Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits.[155] Walking is the most common gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.[154]

Arboreal
Main article: Arboreal locomotion
Gibbons are very good brachiators because their elongated limbs enable them to easily swing and grasp on to branches.
Arboreal animals frequently have elongated limbs that help them cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees).[156] Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, the tip of the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat.[156] Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider.[157] Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.[156]

Aerial
Main article: Aerial locomotion
Slow-motion and normal speed of Egyptian fruit bats flying
Bats are the only mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a constant speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.[158]
The wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than those of birds, allowing bats to manoeuvre more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag.[159][160] By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds.[161] The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly.[162] The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.[163]

Fossorial and subterranean

See also: Fossorial and Burrow
A fossorial (from Latin fossor, meaning ""digger"") is an animal adapted to digging which lives primarily, but not solely, underground. Some examples are badgers, and naked mole-rats. Many rodent species are also considered fossorial because they live in burrows for most but not all of the day. Species that live exclusively underground are subterranean, and those with limited adaptations to a fossorial lifestyle sub-fossorial. Some organisms are fossorial to aid in temperature regulation while others use the underground habitat for protection from predators or for food storage.[164]
Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at the shoulders and tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable to see in the dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole, the eyes are degenerated and useless, Talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the Cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.[165]
Many fossorial mammals such as shrews, hedgehogs, and moles were classified under the now obsolete order Insectivora.[166]

Aquatic
Main articles: Aquatic locomotion, Marine mammal, and Aquatic mammal
A pod of short-beaked common dolphins swimming
Fully aquatic mammals, the cetaceans and sirenians, have lost their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water.[167][168] The flukes of sirenians are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.[169]
Semi-aquatic mammals, like pinnipeds, have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body.[170][171] Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water. They also lack arrector pili, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim.[172] They rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles.[173] Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke.[171] Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage;[170] the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers.[172] Other semi-aquatic mammals include beavers, hippopotamuses, otters and platypuses.[174] Hippos are very large semi-aquatic mammals, and their barrel-shaped bodies have graviportal skeletal structures,[175] adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river.[176]

Behavior
Communication and vocalisation
Further information: Animal communication and Animal echolocation
Vervet monkeys use at least four distinct alarm calls for different predators.[177]
Many mammals communicate by vocalising. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls,[178] to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals to ward off other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer.[179] The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females;[180] they have different dialects in different regions of the ocean.[181] Social vocalisations include the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups.[182] The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground.[177] Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator.[183] Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of the rumbling calls are infrasonic, below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to 6 miles (9.7¬†km) away at still times near sunrise and sunset.[184]

Orca calling including occasional echolocation clicks
Mammals signal by a variety of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, honestly indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape,[185][186] or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected.[187] Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species.[188][189][190] Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalise both socially and in echolocation.[191][192][193]

Feeding
A short-beaked echidna foraging for insects
To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive‚Äîmammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals‚Äîthis is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum.[93] Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested.[89]:‚Ää131‚Äì137‚Ää An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialised digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.[194]
The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type (Allen's rule). Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 ounces (510¬†g; 1.1¬†lb) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of an herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores).[195] Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 ounces (510¬†g; 1.1¬†lb) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites).[196]

The hypocarnivorous American black bear (Ursus americanus) vs. the hypercarnivorous polar bear (Ursus maritimus)[197]
Some mammals are omnivores and display varying degrees of carnivory and herbivory, generally leaning in favour of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous.[198] They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50‚Äì70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, and in some cases strong jaws for bone-crushing, as in the case of hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had sabre-shaped canines.[197]
Some physiological carnivores consume plant matter and some physiological herbivores consume meat. From a behavioural aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, this may be due to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification.[199] For example, it is well documented that some ungulates such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients.[200] Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with haemoglobin production, and as a laxative.[201]
Many mammals, in the absence of sufficient food requirements in an environment, suppress their metabolism and conserve energy in a process known as hibernation.[202] In the period preceding hibernation, larger mammals, such as bears, become polyphagic to increase fat stores, whereas smaller mammals prefer to collect and stash food.[203] The slowing of the metabolism is accompanied by a decreased heart and respiratory rate, as well as a drop in internal temperatures, which can be around ambient temperature in some cases. For example, the internal temperatures of hibernating Arctic ground squirrels can drop to ‚àí2.9¬†¬∞C (26.8¬†¬∞F); however, the head and neck always stay above 0¬†¬∞C (32¬†¬∞F).[204] A few mammals in hot environments aestivate in times of drought or extreme heat, for example the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius).[205]

Drinking
This section is an excerpt from Drinking ¬ß In other land mammals.[edit]
Cat lapping water in slow motion
Jack Russell Terrier laps in water with its tongue. 
By necessity, terrestrial animals in captivity become accustomed to drinking water, but most free-roaming animals stay hydrated through the fluids and moisture in fresh food,[206] and learn to actively seek foods with high fluid content.[207] When conditions impel them to drink from bodies of water, the methods and motions differ greatly among species.[208]
Cats, canines, and ruminants all lower the neck and lap in water with their powerful tongues.[208] Cats and canines lap up water with the tongue in a spoon-like shape.[209] Canines lap water by scooping it into their mouth with a tongue which has taken the shape of a ladle. However, with cats, only the tip of their tongue (which is smooth) touches the water, and then the cat quickly pulls its tongue back into its mouth which soon closes; this results in a column of liquid being pulled into the cat's mouth, which is then secured by its mouth closing.[210] Ruminants and most other herbivores partially submerge the tip of the mouth in order to draw in water by means of a plunging action with the tongue held straight.[211] Cats drink at a significantly slower pace than ruminants, who face greater natural predation hazards.[208]

Many desert animals do not drink even if water becomes available, but rely on eating succulent plants.[208] In cold and frozen environments, some animals like hares, tree squirrels, and bighorn sheep resort to consuming snow and icicles.[212] In savannas, the drinking method of giraffes has been a source of speculation for its apparent defiance of gravity; the most recent theory contemplates the animal's long neck functions like a plunger pump.[213] Uniquely, elephants draw water into their trunks and squirt it into their mouths.[208]
Intelligence
See also: Animal cognition
In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioural flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonise a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.[196]

A bonobo fishing for termites with a stick
Tool use by animals may indicate different levels of learning and cognition. The sea otter uses rocks as essential and regular parts of its foraging behaviour (smashing abalone from rocks or breaking open shells), with some populations spending 21% of their time making tools.[214] Other tool use, such as chimpanzees using twigs to ""fish"" for termites, may be developed by watching others use tools and may even be a true example of animal teaching.[215] Tools may even be used in solving puzzles in which the animal appears to experience a ""Eureka moment"".[216] Other mammals that do not use tools, such as dogs, can also experience a Eureka moment.[217]
Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the 2‚ÅÑ3 or 3‚ÅÑ4 exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence.[218] Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging 8,000 cubic centimetres (490¬†cu¬†in) and 7.8 kilograms (17¬†lb) in mature males.[219]
Self-awareness appears to be a sign of abstract thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition.[220] Mammals that have passed the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not);[221] chimpanzees;[222] bonobos;[223] orangutans;[224] humans, from 18 months (mirror stage);[225] common bottlenose dolphins;[a][226] orcas;[227] and false killer whales.[227]

Social structure
Main article: Social animal
Female elephants live in stable groups, along with their offspring
Eusociality is the highest level of social organisation. These societies have an overlap of adult generations, the division of reproductive labour and cooperative caring of young. Usually insects, such as bees, ants and termites, have eusocial behaviour, but it is demonstrated in two rodent species: the naked mole-rat[228] and the Damaraland mole-rat.[229]
Presociality is when animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of the same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labour, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young.[230] Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.[231]
A fission‚Äìfusion society is a society that changes frequently in its size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the ""parent group"". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment. In a fission‚Äìfusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys),[232] elephants,[233] spotted hyenas,[234] lions,[235] and dolphins.[236]
Solitary animals defend a territory and avoid social interactions with the members of its species, except during breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food.[237] A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey.[238]

Red kangaroos ""boxing"" for dominance
In a hierarchy, individuals are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant while the others are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs,[239] and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals where there is a top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas.[240] Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group.[241] Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.[242]
Some mammals are perfectly monogamous, meaning that they mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate's death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters.[243][244] There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals.[245] Lek mating occurs when males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalisations, as in harbour seals.[246]
All higher mammals (excluding monotremes) share two major adaptations for care of the young: live birth and lactation. These imply a group-wide choice of a degree of parental care. They may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in, or feed and guard them often for a prolonged period of time. Many mammals are K-selected, and invest more time and energy into their young than do r-selected animals. When two animals mate, they both share an interest in the success of the offspring, though often to different extremes. Mammalian females exhibit some degree of maternal aggression, another example of parental care, which may be targeted against other females of the species or the young of other females; however, some mammals may ""aunt"" the infants of other females, and care for them. Mammalian males may play a role in child rearing, as with tenrecs, however this varies species to species, even within the same genus. For example, the males of the southern pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) do not participate in child care, whereas the males of the Japanese macaque (M. fuscata) do.[247]

Humans and other mammals
Main article: Human uses of mammals
In human culture

Non-human mammals play a wide variety of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of millions of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world.[248][249][250] Mammals such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux.[251] Major artists such as Albrecht D√ºrer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals.[252] Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals.[253][254][255] Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome.[256][257] There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own.[258] Mammals further play a wide variety of roles in literature,[259][260][261] film,[262] mythology, and religion.[263][264][265]

Uses and importance
See also: Livestock, Laboratory animal, and Pack animal
Cattle have been kept for milk for thousands of years.
The domestication of mammals was instrumental in the Neolithic development of agriculture and of civilisation, causing farmers to replace hunter-gatherers around the world.[b][267] This transition from hunting and gathering to herding flocks and growing crops was a major step in human history. The new agricultural economies, based on domesticated mammals, caused ""radical restructuring of human societies, worldwide alterations in biodiversity, and significant changes in the Earth's landforms and its atmosphere... momentous outcomes"".[268]
Domestic mammals form a large part of the livestock raised for meat across the world. They include (2009) around 1.4¬†billion cattle, 1¬†billion sheep, 1¬†billion domestic pigs,[269][270] and (1985) over 700¬†million rabbits.[271] Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods.[272] Mammal skins provide leather for shoes, clothing and upholstery. Wool from mammals including sheep, goats and alpacas has been used for centuries for clothing.[273][274]

Livestock make up 62% of the world's mammal biomass; humans account for 34%; and wild mammals are just 4%[275]
Mammals serve a major role in science as experimental animals, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics,[276] and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety.[277] Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year.[278] A knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse with an inactivated gene, replaced or disrupted with an artificial piece of DNA. They enable the study of sequenced genes whose functions are unknown.[279] A small percentage of the mammals are non-human primates, used in research for their similarity to humans.[280][281][282]
Despite the benefits domesticated mammals had for human development, humans have an increasingly detrimental effect on wild mammals across the world. It has been estimated that the mass of all wild mammals has declined to only 4% of all mammals, with 96% of mammals being humans and their livestock now (see figure). In fact, terrestrial wild mammals make up only 2% of all mammals.[283][284]

Hybrids
Main article: Hybrid (biology)

Hybrids are offspring resulting from the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes.[285] Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids.[286] Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognised as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).[287]
Artificial selection, the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals, is being used to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.[288]
Purebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction[289] through the process of genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridisation, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenisation or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species.[290] When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible.[291] Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridisation threatens the existence of rare species.[292][293]

Threats

Biodiversity of large mammal species per continent before and after humans arrived there
The loss of species from ecological communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity.[294] This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates.[295][296] In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided with the appearance of humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.[297][298] The 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by IPBES states that the total biomass of wild mammals has declined by 82 per cent since the beginning of human civilisation.[299][300] Wild animals make up just 4% of mammalian biomass on earth, while humans and their domesticated animals make up 96%.[284]
Various species are predicted to become extinct in the near future,[301] among them the rhinoceros,[302] giraffes,[303] and species of primates[304] and pangolins.[305] According to the WWF's 2020 Living Planet Report, vertebrate wildlife populations have declined by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activities, particularly overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming, which is evidence that humans have triggered a sixth mass extinction event.[306][307] Hunting alone threatens hundreds of mammalian species around the world.[308][309] Scientists claim that the growing demand for meat is contributing to biodiversity loss as this is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction; species-rich habitats, such as significant portions of the Amazon rainforest, are being converted to agricultural land for meat production.[310][311][312] Another influence is over-hunting and poaching, which can reduce the overall population of game animals,[313] especially those located near villages,[314] as in the case of peccaries.[315] The effects of poaching can especially be seen in the ivory trade with African elephants.[316] Marine mammals are at risk from entanglement from fishing gear, notably cetaceans, with discard mortalities ranging from 65,000 to 86,000 individuals annually.[317]
Attention is being given to endangered species globally, notably through the Convention on Biological Diversity, otherwise known as the Rio Accord, which includes 189 signatory countries that are focused on identifying endangered species and habitats.[318] Another notable conservation organisation is the IUCN, which has a membership of over 1,200 governmental and non-governmental organisations.[319]
Recent extinctions can be directly attributed to human influences.[320][294] The IUCN characterises 'recent' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500,[321] and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015.[322] Some species, such as the P√®re David's deer[323] are extinct in the wild, and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the Florida panther, are ecologically extinct, surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have no impact on the ecosystem.[324]:‚Ää318‚Ää Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution,[324]:‚Ää75‚Äì77‚Ää as with the extinction of grey whales in the Atlantic.[325]

Does cognitive empathy exist?,"As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can provide information on the topic. Cognitive empathy refers to the ability to understand another person's perspective or emotions without necessarily experiencing the same emotions. There is ongoing debate among researchers as to whether cognitive empathy is a distinct construct from emotional empathy (the ability to share another's emotions) or simply a part of it. Some studies suggest that these two forms of empathy involve different parts of the brain and have distinct neural mechanisms. Therefore, it can be argued that cognitive empathy does exist as a separate concept from emotional empathy.",True,https://lesley.edu/article/the-psychology-of-emotional-and-cognitive-empathy,"

The Psychology of Emotional and Cognitive Empathy

The study of empathy is an ongoing area of major interest for psychologists and neuroscientists in many fields, with new research appearing regularly.

Empathy is a broad concept that refers to the cognitive and emotional reactions of an individual to the observed experiences of another. Having empathy increases the likelihood of helping others and showing compassion. ‚ÄúEmpathy is a building block of morality‚Äîfor people to follow the Golden Rule, it helps if they can put themselves in someone else‚Äôs shoes,‚Äù according to¬†the Greater Good Science Center, a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology, and neuroscience of well-being. ‚ÄúIt is also a key ingredient of successful relationships because it helps us understand the perspectives, needs, and intentions of others.‚Äù
Though they may seem similar, there is a clear distinction between empathy and sympathy. According to¬†Hodges and Myers¬†in the¬†Encyclopedia of Social Psychology, ‚ÄúEmpathy is often defined as understanding another person‚Äôs experience by imagining oneself in that other person‚Äôs situation: One understands the other person‚Äôs experience as if it were being experienced by the self, but without the self actually experiencing it. A distinction is maintained between self and other. Sympathy, in contrast, involves the experience of being moved by, or responding in tune with, another person.‚Äù
Emotional and Cognitive Empathy
Researchers distinguish between two types of empathy. Especially in social psychology, empathy can be categorized as an emotional or cognitive response. Emotional empathy consists of three separate components, Hodges and Myers say. ‚ÄúThe first is feeling the same emotion as another person ‚Ä¶ The second component, personal distress, refers to one‚Äôs own feelings of distress in response to perceiving another‚Äôs plight ‚Ä¶ The third emotional component, feeling compassion for another person, is the one most frequently associated with the study of empathy in psychology,‚Äù they explain.
It is important to note that feelings of distress associated with emotional empathy don‚Äôt necessarily mirror the emotions of the other person. Hodges and Myers note that, while empathetic people feel distress when someone falls, they aren‚Äôt in the same physical pain. This type of empathy is especially relevant when it comes to discussions of compassionate human behavior. There is a positive correlation between feeling empathic concern and being willing to help others. ‚ÄúMany of the most noble examples of human behavior, including aiding strangers and stigmatized people, are thought to have empathic roots,‚Äù according to Hodges and Myers. Debate remains concerning whether the impulse to help is based in altruism or self-interest.
The second type of empathy is cognitive empathy. This refers to how well an individual can perceive and understand the emotions of another. Cognitive empathy, also known as empathic accuracy, involves ‚Äúhaving more complete and accurate knowledge about the contents of another person‚Äôs mind, including how the person feels,‚Äù Hodges and Myers say. Cognitive empathy is more like a skill: Humans learn to recognize and understand others‚Äô emotional state as a way to process emotions and behavior. While it‚Äôs not clear exactly how humans experience empathy, there is a growing body of research on the topic.

How Do We Empathize?
Experts in the field of social neuroscience have developed¬†two theories¬†in an attempt to gain a better understanding of empathy. The first, Simulation Theory, ‚Äúproposes that empathy is possible because when we see another person experiencing an emotion, we ‚Äòsimulate‚Äô or represent that same emotion in ourselves so we can know firsthand what it feels like,‚Äù according to¬†Psychology Today.
There is a biological component to this theory as well. Scientists have discovered preliminary evidence of ‚Äúmirror neurons‚Äù that fire when humans observe and experience emotion. There are also ‚Äúparts of the brain in the medial prefrontal cortex (responsible for higher-level kinds of thought) that show overlap of activation for both self-focused and other-focused thoughts and judgments,‚Äù the same article explains.
Some experts believe the other scientific explanation of empathy is in complete opposition to Simulation Theory. It‚Äôs Theory of Mind, the ability to ‚Äúunderstand what another person is thinking and feeling based on rules for how one should think or feel,‚Äù¬†Psychology Today says. This theory suggests that humans can use cognitive thought processes to explain the mental state of others. By developing theories about human behavior, individuals can predict or explain others‚Äô actions, according to this theory.
While there is no clear consensus, it‚Äôs likely that empathy involves multiple processes that incorporate both automatic, emotional responses and learned conceptual reasoning. Depending on context and situation, one or both empathetic responses may be triggered.
Cultivating Empathy
Empathy seems to arise over time as part of human development, and it also has roots in evolution. In fact, ‚ÄúElementary forms of empathy have been observed in our primate relatives, in dogs, and even in rats,‚Äù the Greater Good Science Center says. From a developmental perspective, humans begin exhibiting signs of empathy in social interactions during the second and third years of life. According to¬†Jean Decety‚Äôs article ‚ÄúThe Neurodevelopment of Empathy in Humans,‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is compelling evidence that prosocial behaviors such as altruistic helping emerge early in childhood. Infants as young as 12 months of age begin to comfort victims of distress, and 14- to 18-month-old children display spontaneous, unrewarded helping behaviors.‚Äù
While both environmental and genetic influences shape a person‚Äôs ability to empathize, we tend to have the same level of empathy throughout our lives, with no age-related decline. According to ‚ÄúEmpathy Across the Adult Lifespan: Longitudinal and Experience-Sampling Findings,‚Äù ‚ÄúIndependent of age, empathy was associated with a¬†positive well-being and interaction profile.‚Äù
And it‚Äôs true that we likely feel empathy due to¬†evolutionary advantage: ‚ÄúEmpathy probably evolved in the context of the parental care that characterizes all mammals. Signaling their state through smiling and crying, human infants urge their caregiver to take action ‚Ä¶ females who responded to their offspring‚Äôs needs out-reproduced those who were cold and distant,‚Äù according to the Greater Good Science Center. This may explain gender differences in human empathy.
This suggests we have a natural predisposition to developing empathy. However, social and cultural factors strongly influence where, how, and to whom it is expressed.¬†Empathy is something we develop over time and in relationship to our¬†social environment, finally becoming ‚Äúsuch a complex response that it is hard to recognize its origin in simpler responses, such as body mimicry and emotional contagion,‚Äù the same source says.
Psychology and Empathy
In the field of psychology, empathy is a central concept. From a mental health perspective, those who have high levels of empathy are more likely to function well in society, reporting ‚Äúlarger social circles and more satisfying relationships,‚Äù according to¬†Good Therapy, an online association of mental health professionals. Empathy is vital in building successful interpersonal relationships of all types, in the family unit, workplace, and beyond. Lack of empathy, therefore, is one indication of conditions like antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. In addition, for mental health professionals such as therapists, having empathy for clients is an important part of successful treatment. ‚ÄúTherapists who are highly empathetic can help people in treatment face past experiences and obtain a greater understanding of both the experience and feelings surrounding it,‚Äù Good Therapy explains.
Exploring Empathy
Empathy plays a crucial role in human, social, and psychological interaction during all stages of life. Consequently, the study of empathy is an ongoing area of major interest for psychologists and neuroscientists in many fields, with new research appearing regularly. Lesley University‚Äôs¬†online bachelor‚Äôs degree in Psychology¬†gives students the opportunity to study the field of human interaction within the broader spectrum of psychology.

"
How does the rate of photosynthesis vary with light intensity?,"The rate of photosynthesis increases with increasing light intensity, until a certain point where the rate becomes constant. This is because light is one of the limiting factors for photosynthesis. As light intensity increases, so does the amount of energy available for the photosynthesis process. Therefore, the photosynthetic rate increases until all available pigments become saturated with light. After this point, the rate tends to plateau, as the other limiting factors, such as availability of carbon dioxide, begin to limit the photosynthetic rate.",True,https://www.esalq.usp.br/lepse/imgs/conteudo_thumb/How-does-the-level-of-light-affect-the-rate-of-photosynthesis.pdf,

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



The Nobel Prize is an international prize awarded annually since 1901 for achievements in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. An associated prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded since 1969.[1] Nobel Prizes have been awarded to over 800 individuals.[2]
Africans have received awards in all five of the Nobel prize categories: Peace, Physics, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Chemistry. The first Black African recipient, Albert Luthuli, was awarded the Peace Prize in 1960 and the first White African who received the prize was Max Theiler in 1951 for Physiology or Medicine. The most recent recipient, Abdulrazak Gurnah, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2021.
A notable recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize is Nelson Mandela (1918‚Äì2013) the first democratically elected president of South Africa, who played a key role in the repeal of apartheid laws. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 alongside President F.W. de Klerk.[3]
Two African laureates, Anwar Sadat of Egypt in 1978 and F.W. de Klerk of South Africa in 1993, were presidents of their countries at the time they were awarded the Nobel Prize. Sadat was honored along with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin for their efforts to reach a peace agreement between their two countries. DeKlerk was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with Nelson Mandela, who led the ANC but was not president of South Africa until 1994.

Considering Purchasing an iPad Pro to Replace

iPad mini 3 and a mini 5 as my small portable writing computers
I plan to use an iPad mini 3 and a mini 5 as my small portable writing computers. I am a poet, novelist, and essayist. I had been searching for a very small portable writing computer when I was given the iPad 3 and learned that Microsoft Word is available For iPad.

For both security reasons and reduction of battery usage, I work offline. I only use Wi-Fi for these devices, not a cellphone network. I am only online: 1. To transfer data, such as manuscripts, book cover images, etc.; 2. For research; and 3. For those system updates described below in my first question.

1. How often do I need to log on to the internet to be sure the devices are properly updated in terms of security, virus protection,  general OS updates, etc.?
2. Is there any reason working offline is bad for the devices, such as incomplete updating risks?
3. Can the devices be complete turned off to conserve power when not in use, and is this a good or bad idea?

For many, an iPad is a perfectly viable standalone alternative to a traditional laptop computer - although, depending upon the iPad model, many might recommend using an Apple Magic or folio keyboard, or external bluetooth keyboard and mouse/trackpad.iOS/iPadOS Apps, both Apple and third-party, provide the same or similar capabilities as their traditional Windows PC and Mac counterparts - although some may be more limited in their more advanced functions and capabilities.If considering an iPad Air as a replacement for a laptop computer, if your budget will stretch, perhaps consider an iPad Pro.  These models have more RAM (essential for performance) and larger screens (always useful when composing of reading documents) - and include additional capabilities for connection of an external monitor.While desktop monitors can be very useful, many modern portable monitors (typically 15.6‚Äù) support direct connection via USB-C; 4K Portable monitors have pixel density that are very similar to that of the iPad - and will be just as sharp.  The current models of iPad Pro support monitors up to 6K resolution.Speaking personally, as a user of a fifth generation iPad Pro 12.9, even as an advanced user this is now my preferred ‚Äúgo to workhorse‚Äù for the vast majority of tasks.  I now tend to only use a laptop or full desktop system for the few tasks that the iPad cannot accomplish - these generally being connection of external devices that are fundamentally not supported by iOS/iPadOS.

I found that if I want to type for an extended period of time on my iPad, it was very helpful to use an external Bluetooth keyboard.  After I started using the keyboard, I wanted the functionality of a mouse or trackpad, so I added a Magic Mouse.  Now I was carrying the iPad, keyboard and mouse and  - although lighter in weight than a laptop - I was carrying more items to comfortably accomplish the same task.  I'm only offering my perspective.  Hope it helps.

Much less capable! Microsoft Excel is the biggest offender that I have had experience with but there are others. Also some websites do not handle the mobile device well even if you request desktop site. I have been trying to cut the cord for years, and I have the latest iPad air, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil 2. Can‚Äôt do it. At least once every few weeks I have to turn to my MBA. It‚Äôs very frustrating.Also my productivity is just not nearly as good with iPad as with laptop. Even though I have a keyboard. iPad is a more intimate experience, but if you want to go fast, it doesn‚Äôt measure up. Multitasking is a special weakness, and the poor concept of Apple‚Äôs several attempts to implement it lead me not expect it to get much better any time soon if at all.If you can stick to Apple products, and your web-based sites have good mobile apps you‚Äôll probably be fine. But yes, do get a BT keyboard.

The main limitation is that an ipad can only use software from the App store.  So if you need anything which is not available there, you are out of luck, and the versions which are available for iPad are often less capable than the versions available for MacOS.

Jennifer, for the 340 GB of files you can always use the Apple cloud. This should not be a problem. You'll pay an insignificant monthly fee. I am interested if you made the switch and if you're happy with it. I want to go too from laptop to iPad pro and just like you I would like to know if I can use Adobe products in the same way.Please, let me know.Ioan

Dear Lotus Pilot - I had a 27 inch iMac for many many years, the 2015 model I think, and it has been (was) my absolute workhorse. But recently, I decided to upgrade to a MacBook Pro 14 inch with an M1 processor.Prior to this purchase I also updated my iPad to the present generation iPad Air with an M1 processor - which seriously surprised me. I mean literally all aspects of it.I think I have made a big mistake, as I am using the literally spotless laptop less and less ‚Äì sometimes it sits for weeks, not being used where the iPad gets used every day.I am now a ‚Äòretired‚Äô production designer, and take full advantage of the drawing, rendering and creative ‚Äòdirectness‚Äô that comes with the advantages of a touchscreen and Apple Pencil 2.I gradually graduated to attaching a Wacom to the iMac many years ago.My question after reading your response to the earlier inquiry.Do you think (as I am beginning to) that I may have wasted my money (as I am now on a much stricter budget) on buying the 14 inch M1 MacBook Pro (to replace in my old Intel ‚Äòmaxed out‚Äô 27 inch iMac? ‚Äì which was an amazing machine for quite some time -even as it did eventually slow down to a crawl ‚Äì with a lot of waiting + the gradual appearance of the ‚Äúspinning paella of death‚Äù???I also have the original iPad pro first version which is still operating fine as had the battery replaced by a great company I found in Sydney Australia - which was not cheap, but it was definitely worth it.I am wondering whether you could advise me of whether ‚Äòmy idea‚Äô of biting the bullet and selling the MacBook Pro M1 before it gets too superseded - and also sell the iPad Air (fifth generation) - and possibly migrate the two into on multiuse - new - next or about to be announced iPadOS device with the largest screen that I have on my original iPad Pro version one??ü§î

Other than making supposition that a new model iPad Pro will likely surpass the current models impressive specifications and capabilities, I cannot provide any comment concerning unreleased/unannounced new products.  Consider that the current sixth generation iPad Pro 12.9"" is already a powerhouse - and you may find some really good deals are available for the existing model if/when a replacement model is launched.As for offering advice concerning your Mac, I believe you have already reached your own conclusion.  Clearly its residual value will reduce at time moves on.Per my original comments within this thread, I have already made the iPad Pro my primary device for all but the few tasks that it cannot perform.  Perhaps this offers affirmation, should it be required, but only you can make the decision as to suitability for your needs.

I have a gen 8 iPad nothing special, I use it with a logic keyboard as recommended and attach a 1TB flash drive via a camera adapter. Although using I cloud it has already become largely redundant. It is absolutely excellent set up and I can work almost anywhere. It is possible to pull in items over the main screen and some apps will share the screen. It can only improve. I still haven‚Äôt made the final leap but i doubt I will replace my iMac as i am using it  less and less.Setting my sights on an M2 iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard.

Are there any similarities between a whale and a bat?,"There are a few similarities between a whale and a bat:

1. Both are mammals
2. Both are also predators and hunt for their food
3. They use echolocation to navigate and locate prey.
4. Both have adapted to their environment - whales to living in the ocean and bats to flying in the air.

However, there are also significant differences between the two such as their size, habitat, and mode of movement.",True,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131029101617.htm,"

Summary:
Sperm whales weigh up to 50 tons, and the smallest bat barely reaches a gram. Nevertheless, the two species share the same success story: They both have developed the ability to use echolocation -- a biological sonar -- for hunting. Now researchers show that the biosonar of toothed whales and bats share surprisingly many similarities -- even though they live in very different environments and vary extremely in size.

FULL STORY




Sperm whales weigh up to 50 tons, and the smallest bat barely reaches a gram. Nevertheless, the two species share the same success story: They both have developed the ability to use echolocation -- a biological sonar -- for hunting. Now Danish researchers show that the biosonar of toothed whales and bats share surprisingly many similarities -- even though they live in very different environments and vary extremely in size.

Echolocation systems are one of Nature's extremely successful specializations. About 1,100 species of bats and roughly 80 species of toothed whales use the technique -- this is 25% of all living species of mammals. But why have such different animals as whales and bats both developed the same technique? The reason cannot be found in kinship, as bats and whales are no closer related to each other than all other mammals descended from the same land vertebrates for 200 million years ago.
The answer lies in convergent evolution -- when almost identical features or developments happen in different species. Through evolution both bats and toothed whales have developed the same functional characteristics.
Researchers from the two Danish universities, Aarhus University and University of Southern Denmark, have now studied the acoustic properties of the technique behind echolocation in bats and whales in the wild. Previous studies of their abilities to locate and catch prey have primarily been based on laboratory tests, and the studies in the wild now provide a much more realistic picture of how the animals use echolocation.
The studies have been published in the scientific magazine Physiology entitled ""Functional Convergence in Bat and Toothed Whale Biosonars."" The authors of the study are Professor Peter Teglberg Madsen from Aarhus University and Professor Annemarie Surlykke from University of Southern Denmark.
""Our studies have shown that the sounds of bats and toothed whales are surprisingly similar. This is due to two things: First, all mammalian ears are developed in quite similar ways, and second, -- which is the most surprising -- the contradicting physical conditions in air and water along with the differences in size of the animals even out the differences, that you would expect in the sound frequency,"" says Professor Annemarie Surlykke from University of Southern Denmark.
As a bat is much smaller than a whale and its prey is accordingly smaller, it needs to produce sounds with a very high frequency in order to achieve the same capacity to determine direction and size of its prey. However, the effect of the higher frequency will be partially cancelled out by the fact that the sound is transported five times as slowly and that the sound waves therefore are five times as short in air as in water.

The researchers conclude that bats and toothed whales produce signals for echolocation in the same frequency range, from 10 to 200 kHz.
The advantage of operating in water rather than air is that the whale's ""acoustic field of vision"" is up to six times larger than the bat's. The ""acoustic field of vision"" is the area where the animal can ""see"" their surroundings using echolocation. A sperm whale can echolocate prey up to 500 meters away, while a bat's echolocation distance is only 2-10 meters.
Bats fly fast and cover approx. one echolocation distance per second. Therefore they often spend less than a second on detecting and catching their prey. Whales move more slowly and have a much greater echolocation distance. Thus they have more time to pick up information from the echoes and they have time to select their prey more carefully. This may explain why bats do not seem to be particularly picky with their prey, while toothed whales are much more selective about their food. The bat simply does not have the time to choose -- it goes for fast food!
In the last part of the hunting phase, when they approach their prey both toothed whales and bats emit a series of buzzing sounds: Weak and short sound pulses at very short intervals -- similar to strobe lights. It is a very complex mechanism that scientists do not yet fully understand. The animals control very carefully when they emit sounds and when they listen for echoes -- and they adjust this exactly to their own and the prey's speed. If they emit the buzzing sounds too fast they do not have time to listen for the echoes. If they do it too slowly they risk hitting obstacles on the fly.
""The mechanism must play a key role but we do not yet know exactly which one,"" says Professor Peter Teglberg from Aarhus University and continues: ""There is a need for further studies and fortunately new technologies make it possible to track animals in the wild, study their behavior and compare these results with the knowledge we have from the laboratory.""
