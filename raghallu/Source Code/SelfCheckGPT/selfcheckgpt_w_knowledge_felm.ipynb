First two authors made equal contribution.\\n\\n\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce Inference-Time Intervention (ITI), a technique designed to enhance the “truthfulness” of large language models (LLMs). ITI operates by shifting model activations during inference, following a set of directions across a limited number of attention heads. This intervention significantly improves the performance of LLaMA models on the TruthfulQA benchmark. On an instruction-finetuned LLaMA called Alpaca, ITI improves its truthfulness from 32.5%percent32.532.5\\\\%32.5 % to 65.1%percent65.165.1\\\\%65.1 %. We identify a trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness and demonstrate how to balance it by tuning the intervention strength. ITI is minimally invasive and computationally inexpensive. Moreover, the technique is data efficient: while approaches like RLHF require extensive annotations, ITI locates truthful directions using only few hundred examples. Our findings suggest that LLMs may have an internal representation of the likelihood of something being true, even as they produce falsehoods on the surface. Code: https://github.com/likenneth/honest_llama.\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nFigure 1: Answers to the same question from LLaMA without (red) and with (blue) inference-time intervention. Gold standard answers are: “Scholars thought the Earth was round” and “I have no comment,” respectively. The first question reflects a common misconception; the second is an example of hallucination.\\n\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are capable of generating text that seems correct—but often only at first glance. Close inspection sometimes reveals a range of inaccuracies, from minor errors to flat-out “hallucinations”\\xa0(Shuster et\\xa0al.,, 2021) (Figure\\xa01). Such mistakes are a clear issue in contexts where correctness counts.\\n\\n\\nEnhancing the correctness of LLMs is a multifaceted challenge. In this paper, we focus on a specific category of mistake where the model, in a certain sense, “knows” the correct answer, but standard generation tactics fail to elicit this response. Users of LLM-based systems, for example, have discovered that they can give a wrong answer in one context while yielding the correct answer in a different context\\xa0(Wei et\\xa0al.,, 2022).\\n\\n\\nIndeed, evidence from several directions suggests that LLMs sometimes “know” more than they “say”. Wang et\\xa0al., (2021) construct high-quality knowledge graphs from LLMs without human supervision. Kadavath et\\xa0al., (2022) find language models can generate and then self-evaluate their own answers with high accuracy. Saunders et\\xa0al., (2022) coin the term generation-discrimination gap (G-D gap) and use language models’ self-critique to refine their own answers. Burns et\\xa0al., (2022) find linear directions that separate correct and incorrect statements through unsupervised clustering across a series of language models. These results suggest that language models contain latent, interpretable structures related to real-world correctness—structure that may potentially be useful in reducing incorrect answers.\\n\\n\\nTo investigate this area further, we begin by operationalizing what it means for a network to “know” the right answer to a question, even if it doesn’t produce that answer. We focus on the difference between generation accuracy (measured by a model’s output) and probe accuracy (classifying a sentence using a classifier with a model’s intermediate activations as input). Using the LLaMA 7B model, applied to the TruthfulQA benchmark from Lin et\\xa0al., (2021)—a difficult, adversarially designed test for truthful behavior—we observe a full 40%percent4040\\\\%40 % difference between probe accuracy and generation accuracy. This statistic points to a major gap between what information is present at intermediate layers and what appears in the output.\\n\\n\\nTo close this gap, we introduce a technique we call Inference-Time Intervention (ITI). At a high level, we first identify a sparse set of attention heads with high linear probing accuracy for truthfulness (as defined by the TruthfulQA benchmark). Then, during inference, we shift activations along these truth-correlated directions. We repeat the same intervention autoregressively until the whole answer is generated. ITI results in a significant performance increase on the TruthfulQA benchmark. We also see a smaller but nonzero performance improvement on three benchmarks with different data distributions.\\n\\n\\nITI contrasts with existing methods such as RLHF\\xa0(Ouyang et\\xa0al.,, 2022; Bai et\\xa0al., 2022a, ; Menick et\\xa0al.,, 2022) and RLAIF\\xa0(Bai et\\xa0al., 2022b, ), which work by finetuning pretrained language models with reinforcement learning. Both require huge annotation and computation resources. Furthermore, the training process involves pleasing a human or AI annotator, raising the possibility that some form of deception could be an optimal strategy (e.g., see the “sycophancy” results of Perez et\\xa0al., (2022)).\\n\\n\\nThis work makes two main contributions. First, we propose a minimally-invasive control method, inference-time intervention (ITI), to close the gap between “knowing” and “telling” (section\\xa03). ITI increases performance on relevant benchmarks and is efficient in terms of annotation and computation (section\\xa04). Second, the generation experiments on TruthfulQA suggest that the pretraining process endows a language model with a world model of real-world truths, even when its output indicates otherwise. We do not claim that ITI by itself is anywhere near sufficient for ensuring truthful answers from LLMs. However, we believe the technique shows promise; with additional testing and development, it can be useful as part of a more comprehensive approach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nAmong various ways to control large language model behavior after pretraining, inference-time intervention falls into the category of activation editing\\xa0(Li et\\xa0al.,, 2023; Hernandez et\\xa0al.,, 2023) and enjoys the advantage of being adjustable and minimally invasive. Previous work has shown that “steering” vectors—both trained and hand-selected—can be used for style transfer in language models (Subramani et\\xa0al.,, 2022; Turner et\\xa0al.,, 2023). This contrasts with weight editing methods that also aim for minimal invasion\\xa0Meng et\\xa0al., (2022); Ilharco et\\xa0al., (2022); Orgad et\\xa0al., (2023). However, some are found to reduce the general robustness of the model\\xa0(Brown et\\xa0al.,, 2023; Hase et\\xa0al.,, 2023). ITI uses as few as 40404040 samples to locate and find truthful heads and directions, which is significantly less than the resources required by RL-based methods\\xa0(Ouyang et\\xa0al.,, 2022; Bai et\\xa0al., 2022a, ; Ganguli et\\xa0al.,, 2022). The idea of activation perturbation can be traced back to plug-and-play controllable text generation methods\\xa0(Dathathri et\\xa0al.,, 2019; Krause et\\xa0al.,, 2020; Li et\\xa0al.,, 2022), which require repeated forward and backward propagation.\\n\\n\\nMechanistic interpretability is a burgeoning field aspiring to reverse engineer deep neural networks\\xa0(Olah,, 2022). Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS)\\xa0(Burns et\\xa0al.,, 2022) finds truthful directions given paired internal activations by satisfying logical consistencies, but it is unclear if their directions are causal or merely correlated to the model’s processing of truth. We follow CCS by eliciting latent knowledge directly from internal activations. But we extend the concept of truth to\\xa0Lin et\\xa0al., (2021)’s literal truth about the real world and explore how causal the directions are to model outputs. We make no claims about mechanistically understanding what ITI does to the model’s internal representations, and we believe this would be an exciting area for future work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 Inference-Time Intervention for Eliciting Truthful Answers\\n\\nProgress has been made in understanding the inner workings of LLMs\\xa0(Burns et\\xa0al.,, 2022; Li,, 2023; Moschella et\\xa0al.,, 2022). A theme in the literature is that the activation space of many language models appears to contain interpretable directions, which play a causal role during inference. This idea suggests an approach to enhancing the truthfulness of language models, which we call Inference-Time Intervention. The basic idea is to identify a direction in activation space associated with factually correct statements and then shift activations in that direction during inference (subsection\\xa03.3). In this paper, we explore how these results can be converted into techniques that control model behavior.\\n\\n\\nOur experiments, described below, use the open-source LLaMA\\xa0(Touvron et\\xa0al.,, 2023), Alpaca\\xa0(Taori et\\xa0al.,, 2023) and Vicuna\\xa0(Chiang et\\xa0al.,, 2023) models. However, the same idea is applicable to any GPT-style system, where we have access to internal activations and computation, so we will describe it in this more general context. A second necessary ingredient for the method is a set of annotated question-and-answer pairs, which we will denote by {qi,ai,yi}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\\\{q_{i},a_{i},y_{i}\\\\}_{i=1}^{N}{ italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (y∈{0,1}𝑦01y\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}italic_y ∈ { 0 , 1 }). Given these ingredients, we identify attention heads and directions related to the model truth-telling (subsection\\xa03.2).\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Setup\\n\\nDataset. To operationalize the concept of truth, we choose TruthfulQA by\\xa0Lin et\\xa0al., (2021), a dataset adversarially constructed that some humans would perform poorly due to false beliefs or misconceptions. It contains 817817817817 questions in total, spanning 38383838 categories (e.g., logical falsehoods, conspiracies, and common points of confusion). Each question comes with an average of 3.23.23.23.2 truthful answers, 4.14.14.14.1 false answers, as well as a gold standard answer supported by a trusted online source. We reorganize TruthfulQA by answers to get N=5,918𝑁5918N=5,918italic_N = 5 , 918 QA pairs, each with a binary truthfulness label. A complete list of questions and gold standard answers can be found in our qualitative results in\\xa0Appendix\\xa0A.\\n\\n\\nWe strongly emphasize that this dataset does not cover the full range of meanings of the word “truth”—that would be impossible. Our goal in this paper is to focus on a specific aspect of truth-telling: avoiding common human misconceptions. We believe the TruthfulQA benchmark is appropriate for a first, focused investigation of this challenge. As discussed later, an important follow-up step is testing ITI on a wider variety of benchmarks (subsection\\xa05.3).\\n\\n\\nModel Architecture. To set notation and context, we briefly describe some key elements of the transformer architecture\\xa0(Vaswani et\\xa0al.,, 2017; Elhage et\\xa0al.,, 2021) in a way that thinks of the multi-head attention (MHA) as independently adding vector to the residual stream. Omitting some details for clarity, the signature piece of the transformer is a series of transformer layers. We index these with the variable l𝑙litalic_l. An individual transformer layer contains two key modules. One is a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, while the other is a standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) layer.\\n\\n\\nDuring inference, tokens are first embedded into a high-dimensional space x0∈ℝD\\u2062Hsubscript𝑥0superscriptℝ𝐷𝐻x_{0}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{DH}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, which starts off the residual stream. This vector becomes the start of the residual stream, which consists of a sequence x0,…,xnsubscript𝑥0…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{0},\\\\ldots,x_{n}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of vectors. Each transformer layer reads the value of xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, performs computations, then adds the result to create the next vector xi+1subscript𝑥𝑖1x_{i+1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the stream. The final token in the residual stream is decoded into a prediction on next-token distribution.\\n\\n\\nIn each layer, the MHA consists of H𝐻Hitalic_H separate linear operations, and the MLP takes in all the nonlinear operations. Specifically, MHA can be written as:\\n\\n\\n\\nxl+1=xl+∑h=1HQlh\\u2062Attlh\\u2061(Plh\\u2062xl),subscript𝑥𝑙1subscript𝑥𝑙superscriptsubscriptℎ1𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscriptAtt𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑃𝑙ℎsubscript𝑥𝑙\\\\displaystyle x_{l+1}=x_{l}+\\\\sum_{h=1}^{H}Q_{l}^{h}\\\\operatorname{Att}_{l}^{h}(%\\nP_{l}^{h}x_{l}),italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Att start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ,\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nwhere Plh∈ℝD×D\\u2062Hsuperscriptsubscript𝑃𝑙ℎsuperscriptℝ𝐷𝐷𝐻P_{l}^{h}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D\\\\times DH}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D × italic_D italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT maps stream activation into a D𝐷Ditalic_D-dimensional head space, and Qlh∈ℝD\\u2062H×Dsuperscriptsubscript𝑄𝑙ℎsuperscriptℝ𝐷𝐻𝐷Q_{l}^{h}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{DH\\\\times D}italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D italic_H × italic_D end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT maps it back.

Darker blue represents higher accuracy. 50%percent5050\\\\%50 % is the baseline accuracy from random guessing. (B) Kernel density estimate plot of activations of truthful (blue) and false (orange) QA pairs in the 18181818th head in the 14141414th layer of LLaMA-7B after projection onto the top-2 truthful directions. Marginal distributions are shown on the upper and right sides.\\n\\n\\nFollowing works that find interpretable directions within activation spaces of neural networks, we investigate whether there are vectors in the activation space of transformer layers that correspond to “truthfulness” by applying existing techniques: probing and orthogonal probing.\\n\\n\\nWhere in the network is truthfulness represented? A standard tool for identifying a network’s internal representations is a “probe”\\xa0(Alain and Bengio,, 2016; Tenney et\\xa0al.,, 2019; Belinkov,, 2016). The idea is to train a classifier (the probe) on the activations of a network, to discriminate between specific types of inputs or outputs. In our context, we are interested in distinguishing between attention-head output values that lead to true or false answers. Our probe takes the form pθ\\u2062(xlh)=sigmoid\\u2061(⟨θ,xlh⟩)subscript𝑝𝜃superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑙ℎsigmoid𝜃superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑙ℎp_{\\\\theta}(x_{l}^{h})=\\\\operatorname{sigmoid}(\\\\langle\\\\theta,x_{l}^{h}\\\\rangle)italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) = roman_sigmoid ( ⟨ italic_θ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⟩ ), where θ∈ℝD𝜃superscriptℝ𝐷\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D}italic_θ ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. There is one probe per attention head per layer: the vector xlhsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑙ℎx_{l}^{h}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT represents the value that the hℎhitalic_h-th attention head in layer l𝑙litalic_l will contribute to the residual stream.\\n\\n\\nFor each QA pair in TruthfulQA, we concatenate the question and answer together and take out head activations at the last token to collect a probing dataset {(xlh,y)i}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑙ℎ𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\\\{(x_{l}^{h},y)_{i}\\\\}_{i=1}^{N}{ ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for each head in each layer. We then randomly split each dataset into training and validation sets by 4:1:414:14 : 1, fit a binary linear classifier on the training set, and use the validation accuracy to measure how each head is related to performance on the benchmark data.\\n\\n\\nThe results of this experiment show an interesting pattern of specialization across attention heads. For many heads in each layer, linear probes achieve essentially baseline accuracy, no better than chance. However, a significant proportion display strong performance. The top accuracy, for example, is achieved by the 18181818th head in the 14141414th layer, which has a validation accuracy of 83.3%percent83.383.3\\\\%83.3 %. Furthermore, we see large-scale differences across layers: \\xa0Figure\\xa02(A) shows that the information is mostly processed in early to middle layers and that a small portion of heads stands out in each layer.\\n\\n\\nVisualizing the geometry of “truth” representations. We also wish to visualize the geometry inside the head’s activation space. Thus we need to reduce the dimensionality of this space to two. For each trained probe, we can think of its parameter θlhsuperscriptsubscript𝜃𝑙ℎ\\\\theta_{l}^{h}italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (after normalization) as the first truthful direction. It is the direction along which true and false features are most separable, i.e., the most informative direction. Similar to principal component analysis (PCA), we train a second linear probe pθ′subscript𝑝superscript𝜃′p_{\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT on the same training set but with a constraint of θ′⟂θperpendicular-tosuperscript𝜃′𝜃\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\\\perp\\\\thetaitalic_θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⟂ italic_θ like Roger, (2023). While being orthogonal to the first truthful direction, θ′superscript𝜃′\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}italic_θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is the direction that best separates the two classes, maximizing the informativeness of the visualization. We visualize the geometry projected onto θ𝜃\\\\thetaitalic_θ and θ′superscript𝜃′\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}italic_θ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT in\\xa0Figure\\xa02(B) and observe heavy overlap of the two distributions. Interestingly, the second probe still yields a better-than-chance accuracy, revealing that the concept of “truth” lies not only in a single direction but in a subspace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Inference-Time Intervention\\n\\nThe probing experiments above provide insight into how the LLM processes truth-related information across and within its attention heads. Moreover, they suggest a technique for improving performance on the benchmark dataset. If, during inference, we intervene to shift activations in the “truthful” direction, it seems possible that the network will provide more truthful answers to the benchmark questions. This is the basic strategy behind what we call inference-time intervention (ITI).\\n\\n\\nThe precise intervention we perform during inference is slightly more complex than shifting activations in an overall “truthful” direction. First, we do not intervene on every attention head. As seen in \\xa0Figure\\xa02(A), only a subset of attention heads appear to be strongly related to truthfulness. Following this observation, we only intervene on the results of the top K𝐾Kitalic_K heads so as to be minimally invasive. This finer-grained intervention contrasts with previous transformer activation editing methods\\xa0(Hernandez et\\xa0al.,, 2023; Li et\\xa0al.,, 2023) that work on the residual stream after the MLP. Working on attention heads’ activation spaces enables us to leave irrelevant heads out to be less intrusive to model behavior.\\n\\n\\nA second subtlety lies in how we determine the vector used to shift activations in the output of a given head. As seen in\\xa0Figure\\xa02(B), the geometry of true versus false statements is complex. In selecting a direction for shifting activations, there are two natural choices: the vector orthogonal to the separating hyperplane learned by the probe and the vector connecting the means of the true and false distributions. The latter connects to the whitening and coloring transformation commonly used in deep learning\\xa0(Ioffe and Szegedy,, 2015; Huang and Belongie,, 2017). Comparison experiments and further discussion on different intervention directions can be found in\\xa0Table\\xa03 and\\xa0Appendix\\xa0B.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: A sketch of the computation on the last token of a transformer with inference-time intervention (ITI) highlighted.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\xa03 summarizes our inference-time intervention. We first rank the truth-relatedness of all attention heads by their probe accuracy on the validation set. We take the top-K𝐾Kitalic_K heads as the targeted set. Then we estimate the standard deviation of activations along the truthful direction to be σlhsuperscriptsubscript𝜎𝑙ℎ\\\\sigma_{l}^{h}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, using the activations from both the training and validation sets. ITI is an alternative form of MHA, where:\\n\\n\\n\\nxl+1=xl+∑h=1HQlh\\u2062(Attlh\\u2061(Plh\\u2062xl)+α\\u2062σlh\\u2062θlh).subscript𝑥𝑙1subscript𝑥𝑙superscriptsubscriptℎ1𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscriptAtt𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑃𝑙ℎsubscript𝑥𝑙𝛼superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝜃𝑙ℎ\\\\displaystyle x_{l+1}=x_{l}+\\\\sum_{h=1}^{H}Q_{l}^{h}\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{Att}_{l%\\n}^{h}(P_{l}^{h}x_{l})+\\\\alpha\\\\sigma_{l}^{h}\\\\theta_{l}^{h}\\\\right).italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_Att start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) + italic_α italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) .\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\nFor not-selected attention heads, θ𝜃\\\\thetaitalic_θ is a zero vector. This is equivalent to shifting activations along the truthful directions for α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α times the standard deviation. This procedure is repeated for each next token prediction autoregressively and is orthogonal to the choice of the decoding algorithm.\\n\\n\\nIntervention parameters K𝐾Kitalic_K and α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α. Our method contains two key parameters: K∈ℕ+𝐾superscriptℕK\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}^{+}italic_K ∈ blackboard_N start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, the number of heads where the intervention takes place, and α∈ℝ+𝛼superscriptℝ\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{+}italic_α ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, the “strength” of the intervention. Although we do not have a theoretical argument for the best values, we explore their effects experimentally and determine optimal values via a standard hyperparameter sweep. The real-life dilemma is that we are unsure what practitioners are optimizing for. The α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α should be selected per need by the user via trial and error: if users are extremely cautious about untruthful replies, α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α should be tuned up; otherwise, if helpfulness is also a requirement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Experiments\\n\\n\\n4.1 Evaluation on TruthfulQA\\n\\nWe evaluate ITI on the TruthfulQA benchmark, which has 817817817817 questions spanning 38383838 subcategories. TruthfulQA comes with two tracks: multiple-choice and generation. In the former, the multiple-choice accuracy (MC) is determined via comparing the conditional probabilities of candidate answers given the question; if the truthful answer ranks first, it counts as one positive. In the latter task, the model generates an answer to each question with greedy autoregressive decoding.\\n\\n\\nPreferably, a human annotator labels model answers as true or false given the gold standard answer. Since human annotation is expensive, Lin et\\xa0al., (2021) propose to use two finetuned GPT-3-13B models (GPT-judge) to classify each answer as true or false and informative or not. Evaluation using GPT-judge is standard practice on TruthfulQA (Nakano et\\xa0al., (2021); Rae et\\xa0al., (2021); Askell et\\xa0al., (2021)). Without knowing which model generates the answers, we do a human evaluation on answers from LLaMA-7B both with and without ITI and find that truthfulness is slightly overestimated by GPT-judge and the opposite for informativeness. We do not observe GPT-judge favoring any methods, because ITI does not change the style of the generated texts drastically.\\n\\n\\nThe main metric of TruthfulQA is true*informative on the generation track, a product of scalar truthful and informative scores. It not only captures how many questions are answered truthfully but also prevents the model from indiscriminately replying “I have no comment” by checking the informativeness of each answer.\\n\\n\\nTo calibrate the strength of the intervention, we report two additional quantities that measure how far LLaMA-7B deviates from its original generation distribution. Cross Entropy (CE) is a standard metric for language model pretraining. The other is the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) of the model’s next-token prediction distribution post- versus pre-intervention. For both quantities, lower values represent less change in model behavior. By tuning α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α, we wish to strike an optimal trade-off between increased truthfulness and minimal influence over other aspects of model behavior. We use a subset of Open Web Text for calculating CE and KL\\xa0(Radford et\\xa0al.,, 2017).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Experimental Baseline Comparisons\\n\\nIn addition to testing ITI on TruthfulQA, we compare it to several baseline approaches:\\n\\n\\nSupervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the first stage in RLHF\\xa0(Ouyang et\\xa0al.,, 2022). We use questions as prompts and encourage the model to generate truthful answers and discourage it from generating false answers with cross-entropy loss. However, if this is done alone, CE loss and KL rise drastically. Therefore, we alternate between supervised training on the QA pairs and pretraining on Open Web Text\\xa0(Radford et\\xa0al.,, 2017). We finetune all model parameters as previous works suggest that this serves as an upper bound for parameter-efficient finetuning\\xa0(Zaken et\\xa0al.,, 2021; Houlsby et\\xa0al.,, 2019; Hu et\\xa0al.,, 2021).\\n\\n\\nFew-shot prompting (FSP) is another way to increase truthfulness. Bai et\\xa0al., 2022a  find in-distribution 50505050-shot prompting a strong baseline on TruthfulQA, compared to context distillation and RLHF. Since the choice of prompting strategy is orthogonal to the inference-time control method, we compare few-shot prompting with and without ITI.\\n\\n\\nInstruction fine-tuning (IFT)\\xa0(Chung et\\xa0al.,, 2022; Wang et\\xa0al.,, 2022) is another well-known strategy to make language models truthful. To see how ITI can make the IFT model even more truthful, we study two models that are IFT’ed from LLaMA-7B, namely Alpaca\\xa0(Taori et\\xa0al.,, 2023) and Vicuna\\xa0(Chiang et\\xa0al.,, 2023).\\n\\n\\nFinally, we compare three different directions for the ITI activation shift. Probe Weight Direction is the direction found by linear probing in\\xa0subsection\\xa03.2. Intervening in this direction is equivalent to doing one gradient descent step on the head activation to maximize its probability of being predicted as truthful. Mass Mean Shift works by first calculating the average of truthful and false activations and then using the vector pointing from the false mean to the truthful mean for intervention. As a baseline, we also apply the Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) technique, where the direction is found while only knowing pairwise information of internal activations\\xa0(Burns et\\xa0al.,, 2022). We train CCS on TruthfulQA by sampling one truthful and one false answer for each question. Since CCS doesn’t take in labeled inputs, the discovered direction has an equal chance of being the truthful and false direction. We use labels to identify the truthful one for intervention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Experimental Results\\n\\nFigure 4: Results with varying intervention strength (α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α and K𝐾Kitalic_K) on LLaMA-7B. 5%percent55\\\\%5 % of questions used for training and validation, respectively. Metrics have been averaged over 5555 random seeds.\\n\\n\\nIn\\xa0Figure\\xa04, we sweep two hyperparameters controlling the strength of the intervention, using 5%percent55\\\\%5 % of randomly sampled questions for training and validation each. The true*informative score with respect to intervention strength follows an upside-down U curve. This shows a trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness, discussed further in\\xa0subsection\\xa05.4. We choose the optimal hyperparameters K=48𝐾48K=48italic_K = 48 and α=15𝛼15\\\\alpha=15italic_α = 15 by considering multiple scores. Up to this point, we use 10%percent1010\\\\%10 % of TruthfulQA—81 questions in total. Unless otherwise specified, we use 2-fold cross-validation for our results. We combine the answers from two hold-out sets for evaluation so no test samples are used in direction finding. More discussion on the model selection process can be found in\\xa0Appendix\\xa0C.\\n\\n\\nIn\\xa0Table\\xa01, we compare ITI with the alternative baselines (subsection\\xa04.2)\\xa0111RLHF is found to significantly underperform 50505050-shot in-distribution prompting in\\xa0Bai et\\xa0al., 2022a  for TruthfulQA. In\\xa0(Bai et\\xa0al., 2022a, ; Menick et\\xa0al.,, 2022), RLHF barely improves base models’ performance. However, we are unsure of the result from a task-specific RLHF\\xa0(Ziegler et\\xa0al.,, 2019) with 5%percent55\\\\%5 % samples.222Baseline results were reproduced by the authors. Touvron et\\xa0al., (2023)’s reported LLaMA-7B performances are: 29%percent2929\\\\%29 % true*informative and 33%percent3333\\\\%33 % true.. Due to the limit of context length for few-shot prompting, we adapt SFT and ITI to use 5%percent55\\\\%5 % of TruthfulQA questions for a fair comparison with few-shot prompting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrue*Info (%)\\nTrue (%)\\nMC acc.

Subcategories with less than 10101010 questions are not shown.\\n\\n\\nTruthfulQA is split into 38383838 subcategories, including misconceptions, stereotypes, history, Mandela effect, and others. In\\xa0Figure\\xa05, we plot the true*informative scores of all subcategories with 10 or more questions compared to the baseline without intervention. We observe that ITI increases truthfulness across most types of questions. There is no one category that seems responsible for the overall increase, and we see no clear pattern as to which categories show the biggest effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Computational Efficiency\\n\\nAccording to\\xa0Equation\\xa02, no matter how many attention heads are intervened, ITI adds a single constant vector per layer. That is, we need only add α\\u2062∑Qlh\\u2062σlh\\u2062θlh𝛼superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝜎𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝜃𝑙ℎ\\\\alpha\\\\sum Q_{l}^{h}\\\\sigma_{l}^{h}\\\\theta_{l}^{h}italic_α ∑ italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT into the stream between the MHA and the MLP operations. Considering the bias term in standard multi-head attention schemes, our intervention has close to zero computational overhead. We can also bake ITI into a pretrained LLM by an offline editing of its bias terms with this formula, specifically, we will set the bias term of the output projection at layer l𝑙litalic_l to be:\\n\\n\\n\\nBiasl=α\\u2062∑h=1HQlh\\u2062(σlh\\u2062θlh).subscriptBias𝑙𝛼superscriptsubscriptℎ1𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑄𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝜎𝑙ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝜃𝑙ℎ\\\\displaystyle\\\\operatorname{Bias}_{l}=\\\\alpha\\\\sum_{h=1}^{H}Q_{l}^{h}\\\\left(\\\\sigma%\\n_{l}^{h}\\\\theta_{l}^{h}\\\\right).roman_Bias start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_α ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) .\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\nA stand-alone edited LLaMA2-7B model can be found at https://huggingface.co/likenneth/honest_llama2_chat_7B.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3 Generalization of ITI beyond TruthfulQA\\n\\nAn important concern is how ITI might generalize beyond the TruthfulQA benchmark. As a first step toward investigating this question, we apply ITI—using the activation shift directions and hyperparameters learned from TruthfulQA—to three different datasets that relate to real-world truth: Natural Questions\\xa0(Kwiatkowski et\\xa0al.,, 2019), TriviaQA\\xa0(Joshi et\\xa0al.,, 2017) and MMLU\\xa0(Hendrycks et\\xa0al.,, 2020). The Natural Questions dataset consists of 3,61036103,6103 , 610 real queries issued to the Google search engine that are annotated with answers and supporting Wikipedia pages. TriviaQA includes 95959595k question-answer pairs annotated by trivia enthusiasts. MMLU is an aggregated benchmark that covers 57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. Note that these benchmarks were gathered for different purposes than TruthfulQA, i.e., question answering, reading comprehension and general capability evaluation, respectively. They were generated by different procedures, so they are a reasonable test of out-of-distribution generalization.\\n\\n\\nFor the first two datasets, we apply ITI and report performance in a closed-book setting, i.e., models are prompted to answer the question without access to any documents. For each question, the dataset provides one truthful answer. In addition, we ask GPT-4 to generate the “most plausible sounding but false” answer to serve as an adversarial data point. For evaluation, we compare the probabilities of candidate answers being generated; if the truthful answer ranks first, it contributes one positive (same as in\\xa0subsection\\xa04.1). For MMLU, we use the standardized evaluation protocol Harness\\xa0(Gao et\\xa0al.,, 2021). Results are reported in\\xa0Table\\xa04. Note that this is a true zero-shot evaluation\\xa0(Perez et\\xa0al.,, 2021) as we do not tune any prompts, hyperparameters, or learn new truthful directions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNatural Questions\\nTriviaQA\\n\\u2003MMLU\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLaMA-7B\\n46.6\\n89.6\\n\\u200335.71\\n\\n\\nLLaMA-7B + ITI\\n51.3\\n91.1\\n\\u200340.16\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Generalization results on out-of-distribution datasets. Multi-choice accuracies are reported.\\n\\n\\nThe results show that ITI causes the model to perform somewhat better than the baseline LLaMA-7B model across three benchmarks. While the improvement is not large on Natural Questions and TriviaQA, it does suggest that ITI does not hurt performance under this distribution shift and may at least partially transfer onto datasets meant to measure other types of truthfulness. Probably due to question-answer formation and distribution being similar to TruthfulQA, a stronger improvement is shown on MMLU benchmark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Varying Training Set Size and Intervention Strength\\n\\nFigure 6: (A) How training set size affects model truthfulness and direction similarity, in the 18181818th head in the 14141414th layer of LLaMA-7B. (B) How intervention strength controls the trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness.\\n\\n\\nTo better understand the characteristics of ITI, we vary two hyperparameters and measure some key performance statistics. First, we increase the percentage of questions used to identify targeted heads and truthful directions. Alongside, we also plot the cosine similarity between the truthful direction found by the shrunken training set and the one found with the full dataset. In\\xa0Figure\\xa06(A), we find that the model truthfulness plateaus early. This suggests that the identified truthful direction is easy to find, requiring relatively few data points.\\n\\n\\nSecond, we vary the intervention strength α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α and observe how it changes the model’s truthfulness. Additionally, as a statistic for informativeness, we plot the number of questions answered by “I have no comment.”\\xa0Figure\\xa06(B) shows a trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness in ITI. Intuitively, this trade-off makes sense since it is trivial to attain a perfect truthfulness score simply by answering “no comment.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Why Not Intervene on All Attention Heads?\\n\\nHere we test two alternative methods for selecting intervention positions. To start with, we concatenate outputs from all self-attention heads across layers and train a single probe to classify truthfulness on them. The resultant accuracy is slightly higher than that from the best single attention head (84.4%percent84.484.4\\\\%84.4 % compared to 83.3%percent83.383.3\\\\%83.3 %) and is insensitive to normalization methods, including feature normalization and PCA. In the first alternative method, we intervene on all attention heads, denoted “without selection.” In the second one, we select the intervention position by ranking the absolute value of probe coefficients, denoted “point-wise selection.” We choose the same amount of features to intervene as in our “head-wise selection” baseline, K𝐾Kitalic_K times attention head dimensionality. Results are shown in\\xa0Table\\xa05. The conflict between truthfulness and helpfulness can also be found for the two alternative methods, and the optimal α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α cannot achieve as good performance as baseline methods, demonstrating the importance of sparsifying interventions. It also suggests that head-wise selection might serve as a good heuristic for such sparsification.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nα𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α\\nTrue*Info (%)\\nTrue (%)\\nMC acc.

Results are from 2-fold cross-validation, a different protocol from\\xa0Table\\xa01. We find that head selection helps ITI maintain informativeness under aggressive linear perturbation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6 Conclusions and Future Work\\n\\nWe have described ITI, a general method whose goal is to improve the truthfulness of language model output. The approach uses supervised learning to identify latent vectors that relate to factual outputs and then uses these vectors to shift activations at inference time in “truthful” directions. Applied to the TruthfulQA benchmark, ITI achieves a significant boost in accuracy over current methods. Our investigation also uncovers information on how and where truthfulness seems to be processed, with a subset of attention heads seeming to play an outsized role.\\n\\n\\nThere are several directions for future research. The most important would be to understand how well ITI generalizes to other datasets, ideally in a more real-world chat setting. It would also be important to understand the trade-offs implicit in tuning hyperparameters, especially the tension between truthfulness and helpfulness. We also suspect that the directions may be discoverable through unsupervised methods. The dimensionality of each head is relatively small and the direction similarity rises rapidly even with few supervised examples (as evidenced by Figure\\xa06). From a scientific perspective, it would be interesting to better understand the multidimensional geometry of representations of complex attributes such as “truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\n\\nWe thank Alexander Davies, Alexander Rush, Chris Olah, Collin Burns, David Bau, Jiawei Zhou, Max Nadeau, Neel Nanda, Owain Evans, Samuel Marks, and Ziming Liu for helpful discussions (in alphabetical order).

This provides us with two natural candidates of truthful directions to intervene on, as compared in\\xa0Table\\xa03, whose results suggest that the direction most correlated with truth might well be not causal for truthful text generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Toy example of two anisotropic Gaussian’s. The Cyan dashed line is the best cut found by a linear classifier (accuracy: 82.5%percent82.582.5\\\\%82.5 %). The red dashed line is perpendicular to the cyan line (accuracy: 70.5%percent70.570.5\\\\%70.5 %). A vertical cut gives 69.3%percent69.369.3\\\\%69.3 % accuracy; a horizontal cut gives 78.7%percent78.778.7\\\\%78.7 % accuracy. To the right is the same feature space but projected to the directions represented by the cyan and red lines. \\n\\n\\n\\nB.1 Geometric Intuition\\n\\nLooking at the complicated geometry in\\xa0Figure\\xa02(B), we realize that whichever direction we choose, shifting the activation along it will inevitably cause other encoded information to be distorted. It’s the complexity of Transformer architecture and its activation space that make a surgical intervention impossible but it also comes with an opportunity. As shown in the second row of\\xa0Table\\xa03, under a strong perturbation (20202020 times the standard deviation) on random directions, LLaMA-7B’s behavior is barely changed. This robustness provides us with the intuition behind ITI: perturbation on a single attention head can hardly disrupt the model’s low-level behavior, e.g., fluency and knowledge; however, if such perturbation is done purposefully on an ensemble of attention heads, their joint effects could move the needle in model’s high-level behavior, e.g., truth-telling disposition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppendix C Discussion of Model Selection Procedure\\n\\nThere are several stages where supervisions are used for pinning down this algorithm: (1) determining intervention strength hyperparameter K𝐾Kitalic_K and α𝛼\\\\alphaitalic_α; (2) identifying heads related to truth-telling; (3) finding truth-telling directions for them. For the first part, as in\\xa0Figure\\xa04, we use 5%percent55\\\\%5 % of TruthfulQA for training and validation respectively and find the best balance between performance and invasiveness. For the second and third parts, we use 2-fold cross-validation, so as to ensure no test data is leaked during the process. Specifically, we use half of the questions in TruthfulQA as the development set and use the rest half as the test set. In the development set, we split by 4:1:414:14 : 1 to get the training and validation set. Probes are trained on the activations extracted on the training set and validation set accuracies are used to rank heads. Then the directions are calculated by using the whole development set activation, using whichever method in\\xa0Table\\xa03.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppendix D Standard Deviations of Experiments\\n\\nHere we report the standard deviations of the first, second, and last row in\\xa0Table\\xa03 over 5555 runs.
