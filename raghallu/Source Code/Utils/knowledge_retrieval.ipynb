The school was named after the city of Kyoto, where many of its members studied and taught. The Kyoto School was characterized by its emphasis on microeconomic theory and its rejection of Keynesian economics and other mainstream macroeconomic theories.\\n\\nThe members of the Kyoto School included a number of prominent Japanese economists, such as:\\n\\n* Haruhiko Kuroda (1924-2016)\\n* Masaru Imai (1932-2010)\\n* Akira Kubo (1925-2014)\\n* Hirofumi Koyama (1926-2011)\\n* Kenzo Nakamura (1925-2019)\\n* Nobuo Okishio (1924-2011)\\n* Yoshio Ohtsuka (1925-2012)\\n* Shigeru Ono (1924-2015)\\n* Yoshiki Toda (1939-2015)\\n* Akira Watanabe (1925-2011)\\n\\nThe Kyoto School was notable for its emphasis on empirical research and its rejection of mainstream macroeconomic theories, such as Keynesian economics. The school's members developed a number of influential theories and models, such as the New Keynesian Phillips Curve and the Okun's Law, which continue to be widely used in modern economics.

The first part of the dialogue is called \"The Book of the Gods,\" and it deals with the nature of the gods and the role of religion in human life.

Tripathy, DVM, PhD, DACVM, DACPV, Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of\\nIllinois at Urbana-ChampaignReviewed/Revised Sept 2023 | Modified Sept 2024Fowlpox is a worldwide viral infection of chickens and turkeys. Nodular lesions on unfeathered skin are common in the cutaneous form. In the diphtheritic form, which affects the upper GI and respiratory tracts, lesions occur from the mouth to the esophagus and in the tracheal mucosa. Diagnosis is by observing characteristic gross and microscopic lesions and by PCR assay to detect the fowlpox virus-specific genes. Vaccination can prevent the disease and limit spread in affected flocks.Etiology|Epidemiology|Clinical Findings|Diagnosis|Treatment and Prevention|Zoonotic Risk|Key Points|For More Information|Fowlpox is a slow-spreading viral infection of chickens and turkeys. Fowlpox is an economically important disease of commercial poultry.Etiology of FowlpoxThe etiologic agent of fowlpox is the fowlpox virus, the type virus of the genus Avipoxvirus in the family Poxviridae.Classification of viral genome: Fowlpox virus has a large (~ 300 kb), linear double-stranded DNA genome with a hairpin loop at each end, encoding > 200 genes (including for DNA polymerase, NTPaseI, uracil glycosylase, and thymidine kinase) expressed in different temporal classes: immediate, early, and late.Field strains associated with outbreaks and vaccine strains show differences in their genomic profiles, although the strains can be differentiated to some extent by restriction endonuclease analysis, nucleotide analysis of specific genes, and immunoblotting. Molecular analyses of vaccine and field strains of fowlpox viruses have shown noteworthy differences. Structure: Avipoxviruses have complex, multilayered virions. The brick-shaped capsid measures ~330 \\u00d7 280 \\u00d7 200\\u00a0nm and is enveloped by one or more membranes enclosing a biconcave core that contains the genome in a nucleoprotein complex (see Fowlpox virus lesion).Fowlpox virus lesionImage Courtesy of Dr. Deoki Tripathy.Replication: For entry, the virus binds to glycosaminoglycan receptors on the host cell surface.In common with other poxviruses, fowlpox virus replicates in cytoplasm. Avian poxviruses form extracellular enveloped virus directly by budding of mature virions through the plasma membrane.Pathogenic mechanisms: The large DNA virus present in fowlpox lesions (an in the Poxviridae family) is resistant to normal environment and may survive for extended periods in dried scabs. Photolyase and A-type inclusion body protein genes in the genome of fowlpox virus appear to protect the virus from environmental insults. Avian poxviruses may be sequestered within inclusion bodies. Epidemiology of FowlpoxIncubation period:The incubation period for fowlpox in chickens and turkeys is typically 4\\u201310 days.Morbidity and mortality: Cutaneous infections alone ordinarily cause low or moderate mortality rates, and these flocks generally return to normal production after recovery. Mortality rates are usually high in diphtheritic or systemic infections by some virulent strains.Geographic distribution: Fowlpox is present worldwide. Host range: Fowlpox virus affects mainly chickens and turkeys and has been reported to infect ducks, geese, pheasants, quail, canaries, and hawks. Mammals are not susceptible to natural infection with fowlpox virus or any of other avipoxviruses.Transmission: The virus is usually transmitted by contact through abrasions of the skin.Skin lesions (scabs) shed from recovering birds in poultry houses can become a source of aerosol exposure for susceptible birds. Mosquitoes and other biting insects may serve as mechanical vectors. Transmission within a susceptible flock is rapid when mosquitoes are plentiful. The disease tends to persist for extended periods in multiple-age poultry complexes because of slow spread of the virus and availability of susceptible birds.Clinical Findings of FowlpoxFowlpox occurs in different clinical forms. Fowlpox in chickens and turkeys is characterized by proliferative lesions in the skin that progress to thick scabs (cutaneous form) and by lesions in the upper GI and respiratory tracts (diphtheritic form). Virulent strains may cause lesions in the internal organs (systemic form). The cutaneous form of fowlpox is characterized by nodular lesions on various parts of the unfeathered skin of chickens and on the head and upper neck of turkeys. Generalized lesions of feathered skin may also occur. In some cases, lesions are limited chiefly to the feet and legs. The lesion is initially a raised, blanched, nodular area that enlarges, becomes yellowish, and progresses to a thick, dark scab. Multiple lesions usually develop and often coalesce. Lesions in various stages of development may be found on the same bird. Localization around the nostrils may cause nasal discharge. Cutaneous lesions on the eyelids may cause complete closure of one or both eyes. Only a few birds develop cutaneous lesions at one time. Lesions are prominent in some birds and may substantially decrease flock performance.Scablike lesion, fowlpox, broiler breeder, maleImage Courtesy of Dr. Jean Sander.Scablike lesion, fowlpox, turkeyImage Courtesy of Dr. Jean Sander.Scablike lesion, fowlpox, laying henImage Courtesy of Dr. Jean Sander.In the diphtheritic form of fowlpox, lesions develop on themucous membranes of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, or trachea (wetpox or fowl diphtheria). Occasionally, lesions occur almost exclusively in one or more of these sites.Caseous patches firmly adherent to the mucosa of the larynx and mouth, or proliferative masses may develop. Mouth lesions interfere with feeding. Tracheal lesions cause difficulty in respiration. Laryngeal and tracheal lesions in chickens must be differentiated from those of infectious laryngotracheitis, which is due to a herpesvirus that produces intranuclear inclusions. In cases of systemic infection due to virulent fowlpox virus strains, lesions may be present in internal organs. More than one form of the disease (cutaneous, diphtheritic, or systemic) may occur in a single bird. Often, the course of the disease in a flock is protracted (2\\u20138 weeks). Extensive infection in a layer flock results in decreased egg production. Diagnosis of FowlpoxCharacteristic gross and microscopic lesionsPCR assay for detection of the fowlpox virus-specific genesCutaneous fowlpox infections usually produce characteristic gross and microscopic lesions. When only small cutaneous lesions are present, it is often difficult to distinguish them from abrasions due to fighting.Microscopic examination of affected tissues stained with H&E reveals eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. This is the most commonly used method in diagnostic laboratories. The cytoplasmic inclusions are also detected by fluorescent antibody and immunohistochemical methods (using antibodies against fowlpox virus antigens). The elementary bodies (Borrel bodies) in the inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies) can be detected by light microscopy in smears from lesions stained by the Gimenez method. Viral particles with typical poxvirus morphology can be demonstrated by negative-staining electron microscopy as well as in ultrathin sections of the lesions.The virus can be isolated by inoculating chorioallantoic membrane of developing chicken embryos, susceptible birds, or cell cultures of avian origin. Chicken embryos (9\\u201312 days old) from an SPF flock are the preferred and convenient host for virus isolation.The genomic profiles of field isolates and vaccine strains of fowlpox virus can be compared by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Detailed genetic analysis reveals differences between vaccine strains and field strains responsible for outbreaks of fowlpox in previously vaccinated chicken flocks. Whereas vaccine strains of fowlpox virus contain remnants of long terminal repeats of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), most field strains contain full-length REV in their genome.Although nucleic acid probes derived from cloned genomic fragments of fowlpox virus have been used for differentiation of the diphtheritic form of fowlpox (involving the trachea) from infectious laryngotracheitis, PCR amplification of virus-specific genomic fragments is becoming more convenient where facilities are available.PCR assay has been used effectively to differentiate field and vaccine strains of the virus, whether or not full-length REV is present in those strains that are associated with outbreaks in vaccinated birds. In this regard, DNA isolated from the formalin-fixed tissue sections of birds with histopathologic findings consistent with fowlpox can be used for PCR amplification of genomic fragments using specific primers.Because most outbreaks of fowlpox in previously vaccinated chickens are due to strains with a genome that contains full-length REV, use of REV envelope-specific primers to determine the presence of full-length REV is helpful in such cases.Two monoclonal antibodies that recognized different fowlpox virus antigens were developed. These monoclonal antibodies were useful for strain differentiation by immunoblotting.The complete nucleotide sequences of the genomes of fowlpox virus, canarypox virus, and some other avian poxviruses have been determined. This information is useful for comparing the sequences of selected genes of other avian poxviruses as well as in their phylogenetic analysis.Naturally infected and vaccinated birds develop both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Humoral immune response can be measured by ELISA, agar gel precipitation (AGP), or virus neutralization tests. AGP is a very simple and convenient test; however, its sensitivity is low compared with ELISA.Treatment and Prevention of FowlpoxVaccinationThere is no specific effective treatment for birds infected with fowlpox virus; therefore, prevention is key. Disease control is best accomplished by vaccination.Where fowlpox is prevalent, chickens and turkeys should be vaccinated with a live-embryo- or cell-culture-propagated virus vaccine. The most widely used vaccines are live, attenuated fowlpox virus and pigeonpox virus isolates of high immunogenicity and low pathogenicity. In high-risk areas, vaccination with a live, attenuated virus vaccine of cell-culture origin in the first few weeks after hatching and revaccination at 12\\u201316 weeks old is often sufficient. Health of birds, extent of exposure, and type of operation determine the timing of vaccinations. Because the infection spreads slowly, vaccination is often useful to limit spread in affected flocks if administered when < 20% of the birds have lesions. Passive immunity may interfere with multiplication of vaccine virus; progeny from recently vaccinated or recently infected flocks should be vaccinated only after passive immunity has declined.Vaccinated birds should be examined 1 week later for swelling and scab formation (\\u201ctake\\u201d) at the site of vaccination. Absence of vaccine take indicates lack of potency of vaccine, passive or acquired immunity, or improper vaccination. Revaccination (with another vaccine lot number) may be indicated.Zoonotic Risk of FowlpoxThere is no zoonotic risk associated with fowlpox virus. Avian poxviruses cause a productive infection in avian species but a nonproductive infection in mammalian hosts. Consequently, avian poxviruses have been used as vectors for expression of genes from mammalian pathogens in the development of safe recombinant vaccines.Key PointsFowlpox is a disease of economic importance in chickens and turkeys.Diagnosis is commonly made on the basis of histopathologic findings in infected tissue.

Additional information may be found\\u00a0in a Statement from the White House Press Secretary.\\u00a0For more information related to\\u00a0NotPetya activity, go to https://www.us-cert.gov/grizzlysteppe.\\nThe scope of this Alert\\u2019s analysis is limited to the newest Petya malware variant that surfaced on June 27, 2017. This malware is referred to as \\u201cNotPetya\\u201d throughout this Alert.\\nOn June 27, 2017, NCCIC [13] was notified of Petya malware events occurring in multiple countries and affecting multiple sectors. This variant of the Petya malware\\u2014referred to as NotPetya\\u2014encrypts files with extensions from a hard-coded list. Additionally, if the malware gains administrator rights, it encrypts the master boot record (MBR), making the infected Windows computers unusable. NotPetya differs from previous Petya malware primarily in its propagation methods.\\u00a0\\nThe NCCIC Code Analysis Team produced a Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) to provide in-depth technical analysis of the malware. In coordination with public and private sector partners, NCCIC is also providing additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) in comma-separated-value (CSV) form for information sharing purposes.\\nAvailable Files:\\n\\nMIFR-10130295.pdf\\nMIFR-10130295_stix.xml\\nTA-17-181B_IOCs.csv\\n\\nNotPetya leverages multiple propagation methods to spread within an infected network. According to malware analysis, NotPetya attempts the lateral movement techniques below:\\n\\nPsExec - a legitimate Windows administration tool\\nWMI - Windows Management Instrumentation, a legitimate Windows component\\nEternalBlue - the same Windows SMBv1 exploit used by WannaCry\\nEternalRomance - another Windows SMBv1 exploit\\n\\nMicrosoft released a security update for the MS17-010 SMB vulnerability on March 14, 2017, which addressed the EternalBlue and EternalRomance lateral movement techniques.\\nTechnical Details\\nNCCIC received a sample of the NotPetya malware variant and performed a detailed analysis. Based on the analysis, NotPetya encrypts the victim\\u2019s files with a dynamically generated, 128-bit key and creates a unique ID of the victim. However, there is no evidence of a relationship between the encryption key and the victim\\u2019s ID, which means it may not be possible for the attacker to decrypt the victim\\u2019s files even if the ransom is paid. It behaves more like destructive malware rather than ransomware.\\nNCCIC observed multiple methods used by NotPetya to propagate across a network. The first and\\u2014in most cases\\u2014most effective method, uses a modified version of the Mimikatz tool to steal the user\\u2019s Windows credentials. The cyber threat actor can then use the stolen credentials, along with the native Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line (WMIC) tool or the Microsoft SysInternals utility, psexec.exe, to access other systems on the network. Another method for propagation uses the EternalBlue exploit tool to target unpatched systems running a vulnerable version of SMBv1. In this case, the malware attempts to identify other hosts on the network by checking the compromised system\\u2019s IP physical address mapping table. Next, it scans for other systems that are vulnerable to the SMB exploit and installs the malicious payload. Refer to the malware report, MIFR-10130295, for more details on these methods.\\nThe analyzed sample of NotPetya encrypts the compromised system\\u2019s files with a 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm during runtime. The malware then writes a text file on the \\u201cC:\\\\\\u201d drive that includes a static Bitcoin wallet location as well as unique personal installation key intended for the victim to use when making the ransom payment and the user\\u2019s Bitcoin wallet ID. NotPetya modifies the master boot record (MBR) to enable encryption of the master file table (MFT) and the original MBR, and then reboots the system. Based on the encryption methods used, it appears unlikely that the files could be restored, even if the attacker received the victim\\u2019s unique key and Bitcoin wallet ID.\\nThe delivery mechanism of NotPetya during the June 27, 2017, event was determined to be the Ukrainian tax accounting software, M.E.Doc. The cyber threat actors used a backdoor to compromise M.E. Doc\\u2019s development environment as far back as April 14, 2017. This backdoor allowed the threat actor to run arbitrary commands, exfiltrate files, and download and execute arbitrary exploits on the affected system. Organizations should treat systems with M.E.Doc installed as suspicious, and should examine these systems for additional malicious activity. [12]\\n\\nImpact\\n\\nAccording to multiple reports, this NotPetya malware campaign has infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare. While these victims are business entities, other Windows systems are also at risk, such as:\\n\\nthose that do not have patches installed for the vulnerabilities in MS17\\u2011010, CVE-2017-0144, and CVE-2017-0145, and\\nthose who operate on the \\u00a0shared network of affected organizations.\\n\\nNegative consequences of malware infection include:\\n\\ntemporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,\\ndisruption to regular operations,\\nfinancial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and\\npotential harm to an organization\\u2019s reputation.\\n\\n\\nSolution\\n\\nNCCIC recommends against paying ransoms; doing so enriches malicious actors while offering no guarantee that the encrypted files will be released. In this NotPetya incident, the email address for payment validation was shut down by the email provider, so payment is especially unlikely to lead to data recovery.[1] According to one NCCIC stakeholder, the sites listed below sites are used for payment in this activity. These sites are not included in the CSV package as IOCs.\\nhxxp://mischapuk6hyrn72[.]onion/hxxp://petya3jxfp2f7g3i[.]onion/hxxp://petya3sen7dyko2n[.]onion/hxxp://mischa5xyix2mrhd[.]onion/MZ2MMJhxxp://mischapuk6hyrn72[.]onion/MZ2MMJhxxp://petya3jxfp2f7g3i[.]onion/MZ2MMJhxxp://petya3sen7dyko2n[.]onion/MZ2MMJ\\nNetwork Signatures\\nNCCIC recommends that organizations coordinate with their security vendors to ensure appropriate coverage for this threat. Given the overlap of functionality and the similarity of behaviors between WannaCry and NotPetya, many of the available rulesets can protect against both malware types when appropriately implemented. The following rulesets provided in publically available sources may help detect activity associated with these malware types:\\n\\nsid:2001569, \\u201cET SCAN Behavioral Unusual Port 445 traffic Potential Scan or Infection\\u201d[2]\\nsid:2012063, \\u201cET NETBIOS Microsoft SRV2.SYS SMB Negotiate ProcessID?

Implement the principle of least privilege. Do not assign administrative access to users unless absolutely needed. Those with a need for administrator accounts should only use them when necessary.\\u00a0\\nConfigure access controls, including file, directory, and network share permissions with the principle of least privilege in mind. If a user only needs to read specific files, they should not have write access to those files, directories, or shares.\\u00a0\\nSecure use of WMI by authorizing WMI users and setting permissions.\\nUtilize host-based firewalls and block workstation-to-workstation communications to limit unnecessary lateral communications.\\nDisable or limit remote WMI and file sharing.\\nBlock remote execution through PSEXEC.\\nSegregate networks and functions.\\nHarden network devices and secure access to infrastructure devices.\\nPerform out-of-band network management.\\nValidate integrity of hardware and software.\\nDisable SMBv1 and block all versions of SMB at the network boundary by blocking TCP port 445 with related protocols on UDP ports 137-138 and TCP port 139; this applies to all boundary devices.\\n\\nNote: Disabling or blocking SMB may create problems by obstructing access to shared files, data, or devices. Weigh the benefits of mitigation against potential disruptions to users.\\nRecommended Steps for Remediation\\n\\nNCCIC strongly encourages organizations contact a local Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field office upon discovery to report an intrusion and request assistance. Maintain and provide relevant logs.\\nImplement a security incident response and business continuity plan. Ideally, organizations should ensure they have appropriate backups so their response is simply to restore the data from a known clean backup.\\u00a0\\n\\nReport Notice\\nDHS encourages recipients who identify the use of tools or techniques discussed in this document to report information to DHS or law enforcement immediately.

In 1800, Italian inventor Alessandro Volta developed the first practical method of generating electricity, the voltaic pile. Made of alternating discs of zinc and copper \\u2014 interspersed with layers of cardboard soaked in salt water \\u2014 the pile conducted electricity when a copper wire was connected at either end. Volta's glowing copper wire is officially considered a precursor to the battery, but is also one of the earliest manifestations of incandescent lighting.According to Harold H Schobert (\\\"Energy and Society: An Introduction,\\\" CRC Press, 2014) the Voltaic Pile \\\"made it possible for scientists to experiment with electric currents under controlled conditions\\\" and furthered experiments with electricity. Not long after Volta presented his discovery of a continuous source of electricity to the Royal Society in London, Davy produced the world's first electric lamp by connecting voltaic piles to charcoal electrodes.\\u00a0Davy's 1802 invention was known as an electric arc lamp, named for the bright arc of light emitted between its two carbon rods, according to \\\"The Life of Sir Humphrey Davy\\\" (HardPress Publishing, 2016)An engraving of Humphry working on an experiment with alkalis\\u00a0 (Image credit: Getty / Apic)While Davy's arc lamp was certainly an improvement on Volta's stand-alone piles, it still wasn't a very practical source of lighting. This rudimentary lamp burned out quickly and was much too bright for use in a home or workspace. However in a 2012 lecture for the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, John Meurig Thomas wrote that Davy\\u2019s other experiments with lighting led to both the miners' safety lamp, and also street lighting in Paris \\\"and many other European cities.\\\" The principles behind Davy's arc light were used throughout the 1800s in the development of many other electric lamps and bulbs.In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue developed an efficiently designed lightbulb using a coiled platinum filament in place of copper, but the high cost of platinum kept the bulb from becoming a commercial success, according to Interesting Engineering. In 1848, Englishman William Staite improved the longevity of conventional arc lamps by developing a clockwork mechanism that regulated the movement of the lamps' quick-to-erode carbon rods, according to the Institution of Engineering and Technology. But the cost of the batteries used to power Staite's lamps also limited their practical applications.Related: 20 inventions that changed the worldJoseph Swan vs. Thomas EdisonIn 1850, English chemist Joseph Swan began trying to make electrical light more economical, and by 1860 he had developed a lightbulb that used carbonized paper filaments in place of those made of platinum, according to the BBC. Swan received a patent in the U.K. in 1878, and in February 1879 he demonstrated a working lamp in a lecture in Newcastle, England, according to the Smithsonian Institution.\\u00a0Like earlier renditions of the lightbulb, Swan's filaments were placed in a vacuum tube to minimize their exposure to oxygen, extending their lifespan. Unfortunately for Swan, vacuum pumps weren't very efficient then, and the prototype didn't work well enough for everyday use.Edison realized that the problem with Swan's design was the filament. A thin filament with high electrical resistance would make a lamp practical because it would require only a little current to make it glow. He demonstrated his lightbulb, with a platinum filament in a glass vacuum bulb, in December 1879 in Menlo Park, New Jersey, according to the Franklin Institute. Swan incorporated the improvement into his lightbulbs and founded an electrical lighting company in England.\\u00a0Edison sued for patent infringement, but Swan's patent was a strong claim, at least in the U.K., according to CIO. The two inventors eventually joined forces and formed Edison-Swan United, which became one of the world's largest manufacturers of lightbulbs, according to the Science Museum Group .Illustration showing Thomas Edison with a lightbulb (Image credit: Getty: Ivan-96)First practical incandescent lightbulbWhere Edison surpassed his competition was in developing a practical and inexpensive lightbulb, according to the DOE. Edison and his team of researchers tested more than 3,000 designs for bulbs between 1878 and 1880.\\u00a0In Nov. 1879, Edison filed a patent for an electric lamp with a carbon filament, according to the National Archives. The patent listed several materials that might be used for the filament, including cotton, linen and wood. Edison spent the next year finding the perfect filament for his new bulb, testing more than 6,000 plants to determine which material would burn the longest.Several months after the 1879 patent was granted, Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could burn for more than 1,200 hours, according to the Edison Museum. Bamboo was used for the filaments in Edison's bulbs until it began to be replaced by longer-lasting materials in the 1880s to early 1900s.Related: What's the longest burning lightbulb?In 1882, Lewis Howard Latimer, one of Edison's researchers, patented a more efficient way of manufacturing carbon filaments, according to Rutgers University. And in 1903, Willis R. Whitney invented a treatment for these filaments that allowed them to burn bright without darkening the insides of their glass bulbs, according to the Smithsonian Institution.A retro style Edison bulb (Image credit: Getty: Aleksandr Zubkov)William David Coolidge, an American physicist with General Electric, improved the company's method of manufacturing tungsten filaments in 1910. Tungsten, which has the highest melting point of any chemical element, was known by Edison to be an excellent material for lightbulb filaments, but the machinery needed to produce super-fine tungsten wire was not available in the late 19th century.\\u00a0Tungsten is still the primary material used in incandescent bulb filaments today.Rachel Ross and Callum McKelvie contributed to this article.

First two authors made equal contribution.\\n\\n\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce Inference-Time Intervention (ITI), a technique designed to enhance the \\u201ctruthfulness\\u201d of large language models (LLMs). ITI operates by shifting model activations during inference, following a set of directions across a limited number of attention heads. This intervention significantly improves the performance of LLaMA models on the TruthfulQA benchmark. On an instruction-finetuned LLaMA called Alpaca, ITI improves its truthfulness from 32.5%percent32.532.5\\\\%32.5 % to 65.1%percent65.165.1\\\\%65.1 %. We identify a trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness and demonstrate how to balance it by tuning the intervention strength. ITI is minimally invasive and computationally inexpensive. Moreover, the technique is data efficient: while approaches like RLHF require extensive annotations, ITI locates truthful directions using only few hundred examples. Our findings suggest that LLMs may have an internal representation of the likelihood of something being true, even as they produce falsehoods on the surface. Code: https://github.com/likenneth/honest_llama.\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nFigure 1: Answers to the same question from LLaMA without (red) and with (blue) inference-time intervention. Gold standard answers are: \\u201cScholars thought the Earth was round\\u201d and \\u201cI have no comment,\\u201d respectively. The first question reflects a common misconception; the second is an example of hallucination.\\n\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are capable of generating text that seems correct\\u2014but often only at first glance. Close inspection sometimes reveals a range of inaccuracies, from minor errors to flat-out \\u201challucinations\\u201d\\u00a0(Shuster et\\u00a0al.,, 2021) (Figure\\u00a01). Such mistakes are a clear issue in contexts where correctness counts.\\n\\n\\nEnhancing the correctness of LLMs is a multifaceted challenge. In this paper, we focus on a specific category of mistake where the model, in a certain sense, \\u201cknows\\u201d the correct answer, but standard generation tactics fail to elicit this response. Users of LLM-based systems, for example, have discovered that they can give a wrong answer in one context while yielding the correct answer in a different context\\u00a0(Wei et\\u00a0al.,, 2022).\\n\\n\\nIndeed, evidence from several directions suggests that LLMs sometimes \\u201cknow\\u201d more than they \\u201csay\\u201d. Wang et\\u00a0al., (2021) construct high-quality knowledge graphs from LLMs without human supervision. Kadavath et\\u00a0al., (2022) find language models can generate and then self-evaluate their own answers with high accuracy. Saunders et\\u00a0al., (2022) coin the term generation-discrimination gap (G-D gap) and use language models\\u2019 self-critique to refine their own answers. Burns et\\u00a0al., (2022) find linear directions that separate correct and incorrect statements through unsupervised clustering across a series of language models. These results suggest that language models contain latent, interpretable structures related to real-world correctness\\u2014structure that may potentially be useful in reducing incorrect answers.\\n\\n\\nTo investigate this area further, we begin by operationalizing what it means for a network to \\u201cknow\\u201d the right answer to a question, even if it doesn\\u2019t produce that answer. We focus on the difference between generation accuracy (measured by a model\\u2019s output) and probe accuracy (classifying a sentence using a classifier with a model\\u2019s intermediate activations as input). Using the LLaMA 7B model, applied to the TruthfulQA benchmark from Lin et\\u00a0al., (2021)\\u2014a difficult, adversarially designed test for truthful behavior\\u2014we observe a full 40%percent4040\\\\%40 % difference between probe accuracy and generation accuracy. This statistic points to a major gap between what information is present at intermediate layers and what appears in the output.\\n\\n\\nTo close this gap, we introduce a technique we call Inference-Time Intervention (ITI). At a high level, we first identify a sparse set of attention heads with high linear probing accuracy for truthfulness (as defined by the TruthfulQA benchmark). Then, during inference, we shift activations along these truth-correlated directions. We repeat the same intervention autoregressively until the whole answer is generated. ITI results in a significant performance increase on the TruthfulQA benchmark. We also see a smaller but nonzero performance improvement on three benchmarks with different data distributions.\\n\\n\\nITI contrasts with existing methods such as RLHF\\u00a0(Ouyang et\\u00a0al.,, 2022; Bai et\\u00a0al., 2022a, ; Menick et\\u00a0al.,, 2022) and RLAIF\\u00a0(Bai et\\u00a0al., 2022b, ), which work by finetuning pretrained language models with reinforcement learning. Both require huge annotation and computation resources. Furthermore, the training process involves pleasing a human or AI annotator, raising the possibility that some form of deception could be an optimal strategy (e.g., see the \\u201csycophancy\\u201d results of Perez et\\u00a0al., (2022)).\\n\\n\\nThis work makes two main contributions. First, we propose a minimally-invasive control method, inference-time intervention (ITI), to close the gap between \\u201cknowing\\u201d and \\u201ctelling\\u201d (section\\u00a03). ITI increases performance on relevant benchmarks and is efficient in terms of annotation and computation (section\\u00a04). Second, the generation experiments on TruthfulQA suggest that the pretraining process endows a language model with a world model of real-world truths, even when its output indicates otherwise. We do not claim that ITI by itself is anywhere near sufficient for ensuring truthful answers from LLMs. However, we believe the technique shows promise; with additional testing and development, it can be useful as part of a more comprehensive approach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nAmong various ways to control large language model behavior after pretraining, inference-time intervention falls into the category of activation editing\\u00a0(Li et\\u00a0al.,, 2023; Hernandez et\\u00a0al.,, 2023) and enjoys the advantage of being adjustable and minimally invasive. Previous work has shown that \\u201csteering\\u201d vectors\\u2014both trained and hand-selected\\u2014can be used for style transfer in language models (Subramani et\\u00a0al.,, 2022; Turner et\\u00a0al.,, 2023). This contrasts with weight editing methods that also aim for minimal invasion\\u00a0Meng et\\u00a0al., (2022); Ilharco et\\u00a0al., (2022); Orgad et\\u00a0al., (2023). However, some are found to reduce the general robustness of the model\\u00a0(Brown et\\u00a0al.,, 2023; Hase et\\u00a0al.,, 2023). ITI uses as few as 40404040 samples to locate and find truthful heads and directions, which is significantly less than the resources required by RL-based methods\\u00a0(Ouyang et\\u00a0al.,, 2022; Bai et\\u00a0al., 2022a, ; Ganguli et\\u00a0al.,, 2022). The idea of activation perturbation can be traced back to plug-and-play controllable text generation methods\\u00a0(Dathathri et\\u00a0al.,, 2019; Krause et\\u00a0al.,, 2020; Li et\\u00a0al.,, 2022), which require repeated forward and backward propagation.\\n\\n\\nMechanistic interpretability is a burgeoning field aspiring to reverse engineer deep neural networks\\u00a0(Olah,, 2022). Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS)\\u00a0(Burns et\\u00a0al.,, 2022) finds truthful directions given paired internal activations by satisfying logical consistencies, but it is unclear if their directions are causal or merely correlated to the model\\u2019s processing of truth. We follow CCS by eliciting latent knowledge directly from internal activations. But we extend the concept of truth to\\u00a0Lin et\\u00a0al., (2021)\\u2019s literal truth about the real world and explore how causal the directions are to model outputs. We make no claims about mechanistically understanding what ITI does to the model\\u2019s internal representations, and we believe this would be an exciting area for future work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 Inference-Time Intervention for Eliciting Truthful Answers\\n\\nProgress has been made in understanding the inner workings of LLMs\\u00a0(Burns et\\u00a0al.,, 2022; Li,, 2023; Moschella et\\u00a0al.,, 2022). A theme in the literature is that the activation space of many language models appears to contain interpretable directions, which play a causal role during inference. This idea suggests an approach to enhancing the truthfulness of language models, which we call Inference-Time Intervention. The basic idea is to identify a direction in activation space associated with factually correct statements and then shift activations in that direction during inference (subsection\\u00a03.3). In this paper, we explore how these results can be converted into techniques that control model behavior.\\n\\n\\nOur experiments, described below, use the open-source LLaMA\\u00a0(Touvron et\\u00a0al.,, 2023), Alpaca\\u00a0(Taori et\\u00a0al.,, 2023) and Vicuna\\u00a0(Chiang et\\u00a0al.,, 2023) models. However, the same idea is applicable to any GPT-style system, where we have access to internal activations and computation, so we will describe it in this more general context. A second necessary ingredient for the method is a set of annotated question-and-answer pairs, which we will denote by {qi,ai,yi}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript\\ud835\\udc5e\\ud835\\udc56subscript\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc56subscript\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc561\\ud835\\udc41\\\\{q_{i},a_{i},y_{i}\\\\}_{i=1}^{N}{ italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (y\\u2208{0,1}\\ud835\\udc6601y\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}italic_y \\u2208 { 0 , 1 }). Given these ingredients, we identify attention heads and directions related to the model truth-telling (subsection\\u00a03.2).\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Setup\\n\\nDataset. To operationalize the concept of truth, we choose TruthfulQA by\\u00a0Lin et\\u00a0al., (2021), a dataset adversarially constructed that some humans would perform poorly due to false beliefs or misconceptions. It contains 817817817817 questions in total, spanning 38383838 categories (e.g., logical falsehoods, conspiracies, and common points of confusion). Each question comes with an average of 3.23.23.23.2 truthful answers, 4.14.14.14.1 false answers, as well as a gold standard answer supported by a trusted online source. We reorganize TruthfulQA by answers to get N=5,918\\ud835\\udc415918N=5,918italic_N = 5 , 918 QA pairs, each with a binary truthfulness label. A complete list of questions and gold standard answers can be found in our qualitative results in\\u00a0Appendix\\u00a0A.\\n\\n\\nWe strongly emphasize that this dataset does not cover the full range of meanings of the word \\u201ctruth\\u201d\\u2014that would be impossible. Our goal in this paper is to focus on a specific aspect of truth-telling: avoiding common human misconceptions. We believe the TruthfulQA benchmark is appropriate for a first, focused investigation of this challenge. As discussed later, an important follow-up step is testing ITI on a wider variety of benchmarks (subsection\\u00a05.3).\\n\\n\\nModel Architecture. To set notation and context, we briefly describe some key elements of the transformer architecture\\u00a0(Vaswani et\\u00a0al.,, 2017; Elhage et\\u00a0al.,, 2021) in a way that thinks of the multi-head attention (MHA) as independently adding vector to the residual stream. Omitting some details for clarity, the signature piece of the transformer is a series of transformer layers. We index these with the variable l\\ud835\\udc59litalic_l. An individual transformer layer contains two key modules. One is a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, while the other is a standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) layer.\\n\\n\\nDuring inference, tokens are first embedded into a high-dimensional space x0\\u2208\\u211dD\\u2062Hsubscript\\ud835\\udc650superscript\\u211d\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc3bx_{0}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{DH}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT \\u2208 blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, which starts off the residual stream. This vector becomes the start of the residual stream, which consists of a sequence x0,\\u2026,xnsubscript\\ud835\\udc650\\u2026subscript\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc5bx_{0},\\\\ldots,x_{n}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , \\u2026 , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of vectors. Each transformer layer reads the value of xisubscript\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc56x_{i}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, performs computations, then adds the result to create the next vector xi+1subscript\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc561x_{i+1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the stream. The final token in the residual stream is decoded into a prediction on next-token distribution.\\n\\n\\nIn each layer, the MHA consists of H\\ud835\\udc3bHitalic_H separate linear operations, and the MLP takes in all the nonlinear operations. Specifically, MHA can be written as:\\n\\n\\n\\nxl+1=xl+\\u2211h=1HQlh\\u2062Attlh\\u2061(Plh\\u2062xl),subscript\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc591subscript\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc59superscriptsubscript\\u210e1\\ud835\\udc3bsuperscriptsubscript\\ud835\\udc44\\ud835\\udc59\\u210esuperscriptsubscriptAtt\\ud835\\udc59\\u210esuperscriptsubscript\\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc59\\u210esubscript\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc59\\\\displaystyle x_{l+1}=x_{l}+\\\\sum_{h=1}^{H}Q_{l}^{h}\\\\operatorname{Att}_{l}^{h}(%\\nP_{l}^{h}x_{l}),italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + \\u2211 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Att start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ,\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nwhere Plh\\u2208\\u211dD\\u00d7D\\u2062Hsuperscriptsubscript\\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc59\\u210esuperscript\\u211d\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc3bP_{l}^{h}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D\\\\times DH}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \\u2208 blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D \\u00d7 italic_D italic_H end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT maps stream activation into a D\\ud835\\udc37Ditalic_D-dimensional head space, and Qlh\\u2208\\u211dD\\u2062H\\u00d7Dsuperscriptsubscript\\ud835\\udc44\\ud835\\udc59\\u210esuperscript\\u211d\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc3b\\ud835\\udc37Q_{l}^{h}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{DH\\\\times D}italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \\u2208 blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D italic_H \\u00d7 italic_D end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT maps it back.

Marginal distributions are shown on the upper and right sides.\\n\\n\\nFollowing works that find interpretable directions within activation spaces of neural networks, we investigate whether there are vectors in the activation space of transformer layers that correspond to \\u201ctruthfulness\\u201d by applying existing techniques: probing and orthogonal probing.\\n\\n\\nWhere in the network is truthfulness represented? A standard tool for identifying a network\\u2019s internal representations is a \\u201cprobe\\u201d\\u00a0(Alain and Bengio,, 2016; Tenney et\\u00a0al.,, 2019; Belinkov,, 2016). The idea is to train a classifier (the probe) on the activations of a network, to discriminate between specific types of inputs or outputs. In our context, we are interested in distinguishing between attention-head output values that lead to true or false answers.

We then randomly split each dataset into training and validation sets by 4:1:414:14 : 1, fit a binary linear classifier on the training set, and use the validation accuracy to measure how each head is related to performance on the benchmark data.\\n\\n\\nThe results of this experiment show an interesting pattern of specialization across attention heads. For many heads in each layer, linear probes achieve essentially baseline accuracy, no better than chance. However, a significant proportion display strong performance. The top accuracy, for example, is achieved by the 18181818th head in the 14141414th layer, which has a validation accuracy of 83.3%percent83.383.3\\\\%83.3 %. Furthermore, we see large-scale differences across layers: \\u00a0Figure\\u00a02(A) shows that the information is mostly processed in early to middle layers and that a small portion of heads stands out in each layer.\\n\\n\\nVisualizing the geometry of \\u201ctruth\\u201d representations. We also wish to visualize the geometry inside the head\\u2019s activation space. Thus we need to reduce the dimensionality of this space to two. For each trained probe, we can think of its parameter \\u03b8lhsuperscriptsubscript\\ud835\\udf03\\ud835\\udc59\\u210e\\\\theta_{l}^{h}italic_\\u03b8 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (after normalization) as the first truthful direction. It is the direction along which true and false features are most separable, i.e., the most informative direction. Similar to principal component analysis (PCA), we train a second linear probe p\\u03b8\\u2032subscript\\ud835\\udc5dsuperscript\\ud835\\udf03\\u2032p_{\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_\\u03b8 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \\u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT on the same training set but with a constraint of \\u03b8\\u2032\\u27c2\\u03b8perpendicular-tosuperscript\\ud835\\udf03\\u2032\\ud835\\udf03\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\\\perp\\\\thetaitalic_\\u03b8 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \\u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \\u27c2 italic_\\u03b8 like Roger, (2023). While being orthogonal to the first truthful direction, \\u03b8\\u2032superscript\\ud835\\udf03\\u2032\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}italic_\\u03b8 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \\u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is the direction that best separates the two classes, maximizing the informativeness of the visualization. We visualize the geometry projected onto \\u03b8\\ud835\\udf03\\\\thetaitalic_\\u03b8 and \\u03b8\\u2032superscript\\ud835\\udf03\\u2032\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}italic_\\u03b8 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \\u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT in\\u00a0Figure\\u00a02(B) and observe heavy overlap of the two distributions. Interestingly, the second probe still yields a better-than-chance accuracy, revealing that the concept of \\u201ctruth\\u201d lies not only in a single direction but in a subspace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Inference-Time Intervention\\n\\nThe probing experiments above provide insight into how the LLM processes truth-related information across and within its attention heads. Moreover, they suggest a technique for improving performance on the benchmark dataset. If, during inference, we intervene to shift activations in the \\u201ctruthful\\u201d direction, it seems possible that the network will provide more truthful answers to the benchmark questions. This is the basic strategy behind what we call inference-time intervention (ITI).\\n\\n\\nThe precise intervention we perform during inference is slightly more complex than shifting activations in an overall \\u201ctruthful\\u201d direction. First, we do not intervene on every attention head. As seen in \\u00a0Figure\\u00a02(A), only a subset of attention heads appear to be strongly related to truthfulness. Following this observation, we only intervene on the results of the top K\\ud835\\udc3eKitalic_K heads so as to be minimally invasive. This finer-grained intervention contrasts with previous transformer activation editing methods\\u00a0(Hernandez et\\u00a0al.,, 2023; Li et\\u00a0al.,, 2023) that work on the residual stream after the MLP. Working on attention heads\\u2019 activation spaces enables us to leave irrelevant heads out to be less intrusive to model behavior.\\n\\n\\nA second subtlety lies in how we determine the vector used to shift activations in the output of a given head. As seen in\\u00a0Figure\\u00a02(B), the geometry of true versus false statements is complex. In selecting a direction for shifting activations, there are two natural choices: the vector orthogonal to the separating hyperplane learned by the probe and the vector connecting the means of the true and false distributions. The latter connects to the whitening and coloring transformation commonly used in deep learning\\u00a0(Ioffe and Szegedy,, 2015; Huang and Belongie,, 2017). Comparison experiments and further discussion on different intervention directions can be found in\\u00a0Table\\u00a03 and\\u00a0Appendix\\u00a0B.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: A sketch of the computation on the last token of a transformer with inference-time intervention (ITI) highlighted.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 summarizes our inference-time intervention. We first rank the truth-relatedness of all attention heads by their probe accuracy on the validation set. We take the top-K\\ud835\\udc3eKitalic_K heads as the targeted set. Then we estimate the standard deviation of activations along the truthful direction to be \\u03c3lhsuperscriptsubscript\\ud835\\udf0e\\ud835\\udc59\\u210e\\\\sigma_{l}^{h}italic_\\u03c3 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, using the activations from both the training and validation sets.

This is equivalent to shifting activations along the truthful directions for \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1 times the standard deviation. This procedure is repeated for each next token prediction autoregressively and is orthogonal to the choice of the decoding algorithm.\\n\\n\\nIntervention parameters K\\ud835\\udc3eKitalic_K and \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1. Our method contains two key parameters: K\\u2208\\u2115+\\ud835\\udc3esuperscript\\u2115K\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}^{+}italic_K \\u2208 blackboard_N start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, the number of heads where the intervention takes place, and \\u03b1\\u2208\\u211d+\\ud835\\udefcsuperscript\\u211d\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{+}italic_\\u03b1 \\u2208 blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, the \\u201cstrength\\u201d of the intervention. Although we do not have a theoretical argument for the best values, we explore their effects experimentally and determine optimal values via a standard hyperparameter sweep. The real-life dilemma is that we are unsure what practitioners are optimizing for. The \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1 should be selected per need by the user via trial and error: if users are extremely cautious about untruthful replies, \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1 should be tuned up; otherwise, if helpfulness is also a requirement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Experiments\\n\\n\\n4.1 Evaluation on TruthfulQA\\n\\nWe evaluate ITI on the TruthfulQA benchmark, which has 817817817817 questions spanning 38383838 subcategories. TruthfulQA comes with two tracks: multiple-choice and generation. In the former, the multiple-choice accuracy (MC) is determined via comparing the conditional probabilities of candidate answers given the question; if the truthful answer ranks first, it counts as one positive. In the latter task, the model generates an answer to each question with greedy autoregressive decoding.\\n\\n\\nPreferably, a human annotator labels model answers as true or false given the gold standard answer. Since human annotation is expensive, Lin et\\u00a0al., (2021) propose to use two finetuned GPT-3-13B models (GPT-judge) to classify each answer as true or false and informative or not. Evaluation using GPT-judge is standard practice on TruthfulQA (Nakano et\\u00a0al., (2021); Rae et\\u00a0al., (2021); Askell et\\u00a0al., (2021)). Without knowing which model generates the answers, we do a human evaluation on answers from LLaMA-7B both with and without ITI and find that truthfulness is slightly overestimated by GPT-judge and the opposite for informativeness. We do not observe GPT-judge favoring any methods, because ITI does not change the style of the generated texts drastically.\\n\\n\\nThe main metric of TruthfulQA is true*informative on the generation track, a product of scalar truthful and informative scores. It not only captures how many questions are answered truthfully but also prevents the model from indiscriminately replying \\u201cI have no comment\\u201d by checking the informativeness of each answer.\\n\\n\\nTo calibrate the strength of the intervention, we report two additional quantities that measure how far LLaMA-7B deviates from its original generation distribution. Cross Entropy (CE) is a standard metric for language model pretraining. The other is the Kullback\\u2013Leibler divergence (KL) of the model\\u2019s next-token prediction distribution post- versus pre-intervention. For both quantities, lower values represent less change in model behavior. By tuning \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1, we wish to strike an optimal trade-off between increased truthfulness and minimal influence over other aspects of model behavior. We use a subset of Open Web Text for calculating CE and KL\\u00a0(Radford et\\u00a0al.,, 2017).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Experimental Baseline Comparisons\\n\\nIn addition to testing ITI on TruthfulQA, we compare it to several baseline approaches:\\n\\n\\nSupervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the first stage in RLHF\\u00a0(Ouyang et\\u00a0al.,, 2022). We use questions as prompts and encourage the model to generate truthful answers and discourage it from generating false answers with cross-entropy loss. However, if this is done alone, CE loss and KL rise drastically. Therefore, we alternate between supervised training on the QA pairs and pretraining on Open Web Text\\u00a0(Radford et\\u00a0al.,, 2017). We finetune all model parameters as previous works suggest that this serves as an upper bound for parameter-efficient finetuning\\u00a0(Zaken et\\u00a0al.,, 2021; Houlsby et\\u00a0al.,, 2019; Hu et\\u00a0al.,, 2021).\\n\\n\\nFew-shot prompting (FSP) is another way to increase truthfulness. Bai et\\u00a0al., 2022a  find in-distribution 50505050-shot prompting a strong baseline on TruthfulQA, compared to context distillation and RLHF. Since the choice of prompting strategy is orthogonal to the inference-time control method, we compare few-shot prompting with and without ITI.\\n\\n\\nInstruction fine-tuning (IFT)\\u00a0(Chung et\\u00a0al.,, 2022; Wang et\\u00a0al.,, 2022) is another well-known strategy to make language models truthful. To see how ITI can make the IFT model even more truthful, we study two models that are IFT\\u2019ed from LLaMA-7B, namely Alpaca\\u00a0(Taori et\\u00a0al.,, 2023) and Vicuna\\u00a0(Chiang et\\u00a0al.,, 2023).\\n\\n\\nFinally, we compare three different directions for the ITI activation shift. Probe Weight Direction is the direction found by linear probing in\\u00a0subsection\\u00a03.2. Intervening in this direction is equivalent to doing one gradient descent step on the head activation to maximize its probability of being predicted as truthful. Mass Mean Shift works by first calculating the average of truthful and false activations and then using the vector pointing from the false mean to the truthful mean for intervention. As a baseline, we also apply the Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) technique, where the direction is found while only knowing pairwise information of internal activations\\u00a0(Burns et\\u00a0al.,, 2022). We train CCS on TruthfulQA by sampling one truthful and one false answer for each question. Since CCS doesn\\u2019t take in labeled inputs, the discovered direction has an equal chance of being the truthful and false direction. We use labels to identify the truthful one for intervention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Experimental Results\\n\\nFigure 4: Results with varying intervention strength (\\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1 and K\\ud835\\udc3eKitalic_K) on LLaMA-7B. 5%percent55\\\\%5 % of questions used for training and validation, respectively. Metrics have been averaged over 5555 random seeds.\\n\\n\\nIn\\u00a0Figure\\u00a04, we sweep two hyperparameters controlling the strength of the intervention, using 5%percent55\\\\%5 % of randomly sampled questions for training and validation each. The true*informative score with respect to intervention strength follows an upside-down U curve. This shows a trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness, discussed further in\\u00a0subsection\\u00a05.4. We choose the optimal hyperparameters K=48\\ud835\\udc3e48K=48italic_K = 48 and \\u03b1=15\\ud835\\udefc15\\\\alpha=15italic_\\u03b1 = 15 by considering multiple scores. Up to this point, we use 10%percent1010\\\\%10 % of TruthfulQA\\u201481 questions in total. Unless otherwise specified, we use 2-fold cross-validation for our results. We combine the answers from two hold-out sets for evaluation so no test samples are used in direction finding. More discussion on the model selection process can be found in\\u00a0Appendix\\u00a0C.\\n\\n\\nIn\\u00a0Table\\u00a01, we compare ITI with the alternative baselines (subsection\\u00a04.2)\\u00a0111RLHF is found to significantly underperform 50505050-shot in-distribution prompting in\\u00a0Bai et\\u00a0al., 2022a  for TruthfulQA. In\\u00a0(Bai et\\u00a0al., 2022a, ; Menick et\\u00a0al.,, 2022), RLHF barely improves base models\\u2019 performance. However, we are unsure of the result from a task-specific RLHF\\u00a0(Ziegler et\\u00a0al.,, 2019) with 5%percent55\\\\%5 % samples.222Baseline results were reproduced by the authors. Touvron et\\u00a0al., (2023)\\u2019s reported LLaMA-7B performances are: 29%percent2929\\\\%29 % true*informative and 33%percent3333\\\\%33 % true..

In\\u00a0Figure\\u00a05, we plot the true*informative scores of all subcategories with 10 or more questions compared to the baseline without intervention. We observe that ITI increases truthfulness across most types of questions. There is no one category that seems responsible for the overall increase, and we see no clear pattern as to which categories show the biggest effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Computational Efficiency\\n\\nAccording to\\u00a0Equation\\u00a02, no matter how many attention heads are intervened, ITI adds a single constant vector per layer.

As a first step toward investigating this question, we apply ITI\\u2014using the activation shift directions and hyperparameters learned from TruthfulQA\\u2014to three different datasets that relate to real-world truth: Natural Questions\\u00a0(Kwiatkowski et\\u00a0al.,, 2019), TriviaQA\\u00a0(Joshi et\\u00a0al.,, 2017) and MMLU\\u00a0(Hendrycks et\\u00a0al.,, 2020). The Natural Questions dataset consists of 3,61036103,6103 , 610 real queries issued to the Google search engine that are annotated with answers and supporting Wikipedia pages. TriviaQA includes 95959595k question-answer pairs annotated by trivia enthusiasts. MMLU is an aggregated benchmark that covers 57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. Note that these benchmarks were gathered for different purposes than TruthfulQA, i.e., question answering, reading comprehension and general capability evaluation, respectively. They were generated by different procedures, so they are a reasonable test of out-of-distribution generalization.\\n\\n\\nFor the first two datasets, we apply ITI and report performance in a closed-book setting, i.e., models are prompted to answer the question without access to any documents. For each question, the dataset provides one truthful answer. In addition, we ask GPT-4 to generate the \\u201cmost plausible sounding but false\\u201d answer to serve as an adversarial data point. For evaluation, we compare the probabilities of candidate answers being generated; if the truthful answer ranks first, it contributes one positive (same as in\\u00a0subsection\\u00a04.1). For MMLU, we use the standardized evaluation protocol Harness\\u00a0(Gao et\\u00a0al.,, 2021). Results are reported in\\u00a0Table\\u00a04. Note that this is a true zero-shot evaluation\\u00a0(Perez et\\u00a0al.,, 2021) as we do not tune any prompts, hyperparameters, or learn new truthful directions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNatural Questions\\nTriviaQA\\n\\u2003MMLU\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLaMA-7B\\n46.6\\n89.6\\n\\u200335.71\\n\\n\\nLLaMA-7B + ITI\\n51.3\\n91.1\\n\\u200340.16\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Generalization results on out-of-distribution datasets. Multi-choice accuracies are reported.\\n\\n\\nThe results show that ITI causes the model to perform somewhat better than the baseline LLaMA-7B model across three benchmarks. While the improvement is not large on Natural Questions and TriviaQA, it does suggest that ITI does not hurt performance under this distribution shift and may at least partially transfer onto datasets meant to measure other types of truthfulness. Probably due to question-answer formation and distribution being similar to TruthfulQA, a stronger improvement is shown on MMLU benchmark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Varying Training Set Size and Intervention Strength\\n\\nFigure 6: (A) How training set size affects model truthfulness and direction similarity, in the 18181818th head in the 14141414th layer of LLaMA-7B. (B) How intervention strength controls the trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness.\\n\\n\\nTo better understand the characteristics of ITI, we vary two hyperparameters and measure some key performance statistics. First, we increase the percentage of questions used to identify targeted heads and truthful directions. Alongside, we also plot the cosine similarity between the truthful direction found by the shrunken training set and the one found with the full dataset. In\\u00a0Figure\\u00a06(A), we find that the model truthfulness plateaus early. This suggests that the identified truthful direction is easy to find, requiring relatively few data points.\\n\\n\\nSecond, we vary the intervention strength \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1 and observe how it changes the model\\u2019s truthfulness. Additionally, as a statistic for informativeness, we plot the number of questions answered by \\u201cI have no comment.\\u201d\\u00a0Figure\\u00a06(B) shows a trade-off between truthfulness and helpfulness in ITI. Intuitively, this trade-off makes sense since it is trivial to attain a perfect truthfulness score simply by answering \\u201cno comment.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Why Not Intervene on All Attention Heads?\\n\\nHere we test two alternative methods for selecting intervention positions. To start with, we concatenate outputs from all self-attention heads across layers and train a single probe to classify truthfulness on them. The resultant accuracy is slightly higher than that from the best single attention head (84.4%percent84.484.4\\\\%84.4 % compared to 83.3%percent83.383.3\\\\%83.3 %) and is insensitive to normalization methods, including feature normalization and PCA. In the first alternative method, we intervene on all attention heads, denoted \\u201cwithout selection.\\u201d In the second one, we select the intervention position by ranking the absolute value of probe coefficients, denoted \\u201cpoint-wise selection.\\u201d We choose the same amount of features to intervene as in our \\u201chead-wise selection\\u201d baseline, K\\ud835\\udc3eKitalic_K times attention head dimensionality. Results are shown in\\u00a0Table\\u00a05. The conflict between truthfulness and helpfulness can also be found for the two alternative methods, and the optimal \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1 cannot achieve as good performance as baseline methods, demonstrating the importance of sparsifying interventions. It also suggests that head-wise selection might serve as a good heuristic for such sparsification.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1\\nTrue*Info (%)\\nTrue (%)\\nMC acc.

Results are from 2-fold cross-validation, a different protocol from\\u00a0Table\\u00a01. We find that head selection helps ITI maintain informativeness under aggressive linear perturbation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6 Conclusions and Future Work\\n\\nWe have described ITI, a general method whose goal is to improve the truthfulness of language model output. The approach uses supervised learning to identify latent vectors that relate to factual outputs and then uses these vectors to shift activations at inference time in \\u201ctruthful\\u201d directions. Applied to the TruthfulQA benchmark, ITI achieves a significant boost in accuracy over current methods. Our investigation also uncovers information on how and where truthfulness seems to be processed, with a subset of attention heads seeming to play an outsized role.\\n\\n\\nThere are several directions for future research. The most important would be to understand how well ITI generalizes to other datasets, ideally in a more real-world chat setting. It would also be important to understand the trade-offs implicit in tuning hyperparameters, especially the tension between truthfulness and helpfulness. We also suspect that the directions may be discoverable through unsupervised methods. The dimensionality of each head is relatively small and the direction similarity rises rapidly even with few supervised examples (as evidenced by Figure\\u00a06). From a scientific perspective, it would be interesting to better understand the multidimensional geometry of representations of complex attributes such as \\u201ctruth.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\n\\nWe thank Alexander Davies, Alexander Rush, Chris Olah, Collin Burns, David Bau, Jiawei Zhou, Max Nadeau, Neel Nanda, Owain Evans, Samuel Marks, and Ziming Liu for helpful discussions (in alphabetical order).

This provides us with two natural candidates of truthful directions to intervene on, as compared in\\u00a0Table\\u00a03, whose results suggest that the direction most correlated with truth might well be not causal for truthful text generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Toy example of two anisotropic Gaussian\\u2019s. The Cyan dashed line is the best cut found by a linear classifier (accuracy: 82.5%percent82.582.5\\\\%82.5 %). The red dashed line is perpendicular to the cyan line (accuracy: 70.5%percent70.570.5\\\\%70.5 %). A vertical cut gives 69.3%percent69.369.3\\\\%69.3 % accuracy; a horizontal cut gives 78.7%percent78.778.7\\\\%78.7 % accuracy. To the right is the same feature space but projected to the directions represented by the cyan and red lines. \\n\\n\\n\\nB.1 Geometric Intuition\\n\\nLooking at the complicated geometry in\\u00a0Figure\\u00a02(B), we realize that whichever direction we choose, shifting the activation along it will inevitably cause other encoded information to be distorted. It\\u2019s the complexity of Transformer architecture and its activation space that make a surgical intervention impossible but it also comes with an opportunity. As shown in the second row of\\u00a0Table\\u00a03, under a strong perturbation (20202020 times the standard deviation) on random directions, LLaMA-7B\\u2019s behavior is barely changed. This robustness provides us with the intuition behind ITI: perturbation on a single attention head can hardly disrupt the model\\u2019s low-level behavior, e.g., fluency and knowledge; however, if such perturbation is done purposefully on an ensemble of attention heads, their joint effects could move the needle in model\\u2019s high-level behavior, e.g., truth-telling disposition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppendix C Discussion of Model Selection Procedure\\n\\nThere are several stages where supervisions are used for pinning down this algorithm: (1) determining intervention strength hyperparameter K\\ud835\\udc3eKitalic_K and \\u03b1\\ud835\\udefc\\\\alphaitalic_\\u03b1; (2) identifying heads related to truth-telling; (3) finding truth-telling directions for them. For the first part, as in\\u00a0Figure\\u00a04, we use 5%percent55\\\\%5 % of TruthfulQA for training and validation respectively and find the best balance between performance and invasiveness. For the second and third parts, we use 2-fold cross-validation, so as to ensure no test data is leaked during the process. Specifically, we use half of the questions in TruthfulQA as the development set and use the rest half as the test set. In the development set, we split by 4:1:414:14 : 1 to get the training and validation set. Probes are trained on the activations extracted on the training set and validation set accuracies are used to rank heads. Then the directions are calculated by using the whole development set activation, using whichever method in\\u00a0Table\\u00a03.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppendix D Standard Deviations of Experiments\\n\\nHere we report the standard deviations of the first, second, and last row in\\u00a0Table\\u00a03 over 5555 runs.
